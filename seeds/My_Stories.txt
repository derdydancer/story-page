The Comb and the Mirror
In a lady's chamber lay a fine ivory comb and a small hand-mirror with a silver frame. One morning, the comb, having just smoothed the lady's hair, sat preening itself in a sunbeam.

‘See how useful I am!’ said the comb to the mirror. ‘I take the tangled locks and make them smooth and orderly. Without me, the lady would look quite wild.’

The mirror remained silent, reflecting the sunbeam.

‘And I am beautiful too,’ continued the comb, waggling its teeth slightly. ‘My ivory is white and polished, each tooth perfectly formed. You, mirror, only show what is put before you. You have no beauty of your own.’

The mirror still said nothing, but reflected the proud comb.

Just then, the lady returned in haste, seeking her gloves. In her hurry, she knocked the comb from the table. It fell to the hard floor, and two of its fine teeth snapped off.

‘Alas!’ cried the comb. ‘Look what has happened! I am ruined!’

The mirror reflected the broken comb lying on the floor.

‘And you,’ wept the comb, ‘you just show my misfortune! You are cruel.’

‘I show only what is,’ the mirror reflected silently, as the maid came in and swept the broken comb away with the dust.

The Baker's Imp

There lived a baker who was known for his honesty, but also for his temper. One morning, he found his bread had not risen properly overnight. ‘Mischief!’ he muttered, blaming the yeast. But the next night, though he used fresh yeast, the same thing happened. On the third night, he resolved to watch.

He hid himself behind some flour sacks, and near midnight, he saw a tiny creature, no bigger than his thumb, with pointed ears and clothes like brown leaves, creep into the bakery. It skipped over to his dough trough and giggled, then pinched off a piece of dough and popped it into its mouth. After that, it danced three times around the trough, whispering strange words, and vanished up the chimney. In the morning, the bread was again flat and heavy.

‘Aha!’ thought the baker. ‘So that is the rogue!’ The next night, he left a small bowl of warm milk and a crumb of honey cake near the trough. When the imp appeared, it saw the offering, sniffed suspiciously, but then drank the milk and ate the cake greedily. ‘Hmm,’ it chirped, ‘better fare than dough.’ It danced only once around the trough, and vanished. The next morning, the bread had risen, though not as high as usual.

The following night, the baker left milk and honey cake again, and added a tiny silver coin. The imp ate, drank, saw the coin, and snatched it up with delight. It bowed quickly towards the sacks where the baker hid, did not dance at all, and vanished. The next morning, the bread rose perfectly, light and golden.

The baker thought, ‘I have pleased the creature.’ So, every night he left milk, cake, and a small coin. His bread became famous throughout the town for its lightness and flavour, and he prospered greatly.

But the baker grew greedy. ‘Why should I pay this imp every night?’ he thought. ‘He does nothing but dance and whisper.’ So one night, he left out only the milk and cake, but no coin.

The imp came, ate and drank, but then looked about for the coin. Seeing none, its face grew stormy. It kicked over the milk bowl, stamped on the cake crumbs, and then jumped into the dough trough, stirring the dough wildly with its dirty feet while shrieking tiny curses. Then it vanished up the chimney.

The next morning, the bread was not only flat but tasted of soot and spite. The baker was furious. That night, he waited with a heavy wooden peel. When the imp came, before it could reach the trough, the baker leapt out. ‘You villain!’ he roared, swinging the peel. The imp dodged, nimble as a flea, and spat at him. ‘You broke the bargain!’ it shrieked. ‘Now your bread will always show your temper!’ And it vanished.

From that day on, no matter how carefully the baker worked, his bread was often sour, or heavy, or burnt. His fame faded, his temper worsened, and people said his bread tasted of anger. He never prospered as he had before, and never again saw the little baker’s imp.

The Red Thread Spool

A widow had one son, named Martin, whom she loved dearly. When he grew to be a young man, he wished to travel and seek his fortune. His mother wept, but gave him her blessing, and one parting gift. ‘Son,’ she said, ‘take this spool of red thread. It was my grandmother’s, and hers before her. It has this virtue: if ever you are lost, unwind the thread, and it will lead you home. But beware – never, ever cut the thread, no matter the reason, or misfortune will follow.’

Martin thanked his mother, put the spool in his pocket, and went forth into the world. He journeyed through many lands and saw many wonders, but found no great fortune. After a year, he grew homesick and decided to return.

He was travelling through a vast, unfamiliar forest when a thick fog descended, so dense he could not see his hand before his face. He wandered for hours, completely lost. Then he remembered his mother’s gift. He took out the spool of red thread, tied one end securely to a pine tree, and began to walk, letting the thread unwind behind him. The thread glowed faintly in the fog, showing him the way. It led him through tangled thickets and over marshy ground, always pulling gently in the direction of home.

After some time, the thread led him to the bank of a wide, swift river. There was no bridge and no boat. The thread led straight across the water. ‘How can I follow now?’ thought Martin. As he stood dismayed, he saw something caught in the reeds on the far bank – it looked like a small, overturned boat. ‘If only I could reach it,’ he thought. He looked at the red thread stretching over the water. ‘It seems strong,’ he mused. ‘Perhaps I could use it as a rope to pull the boat across.’

Forgetting his mother’s warning in his eagerness, he drew his knife and cut the thread near where it was tied to the tree. He knotted the loose end around his waist and plunged into the cold river, holding the other cut end, intending to swim across and use the thread to haul the boat back.

But the moment the thread was severed, the faint glow vanished. The fog seemed to thicken, and the river current grew stronger, pulling him downstream. He lost his grip on the cut end of the thread, which whipped away into the mist. He struggled in the water, trying to swim, but he was swept away, turning over and over, until he fetched up bruised and gasping on a muddy bank far downstream, in a part of the forest even wilder and darker than before.

The spool was gone from his pocket, lost in the river. He was now truly lost, with no guide home. He wandered for many days, living on roots and berries, growing ragged and thin. 'I never should have cut the thread!', he lamented.

One evening, exhausted, he lay down under a great oak. As he drifted to sleep, he heard a gentle singing. He looked up and saw, perched on a branch above him, a little bird with feathers like spun gold. It held in its beak a familiar-looking spool, with red thread tightly wound.

The bird looked down at him and sang:

‘The thread that’s cut cannot be whole,
A broken trust has cost its toll.
Seek not the spool, but mend the way,
With patient deed, from day to day.’

Then it flew away, leaving the spool behind on the branch. Martin climbed up and took the spool, but the thread would not unwind. It was fixed fast. He understood the bird’s message. He could not magically follow the thread home now; he had broken that trust. He must find his own way through patient effort.

Putting the useless spool back in his pocket as a reminder, Martin stood up. He looked at the sun, marked the moss on the trees, and began walking steadily eastward, the direction he remembered his home lay. He travelled for many weeks, working for farmers for food, asking directions, always moving patiently towards home.

At long last, weary but wiser, he saw the familiar spire of his village church. He ran the last mile, and his mother, who had prayed for him daily, wept with joy to see him return. He told her of his journey and how he had cut the thread.

‘Ah, son,’ she said sadly, ‘a gift’s virtue lies in obedience to its nature. But you have found your way back through your own steadfastness, and that is a greater fortune.’

Martin kept the spool, but its thread never unwound again. He settled in his village, worked hard, and prospered moderately, always remembering the cost of impatience and the value of patient effort.

The Gardener Who Was a Duke

There was once a duke whose lands were stolen by a treacherous cousin. Fearing for his life, the duke fled in disguise, taking nothing but the plain clothes on his back and a single seed from the rarest flower in his castle garden, the Midnight Bloom, which opened only under the full moon. He travelled far until he came to a kingdom where he was unknown, and seeking honest work, he offered his services as a gardener at the king’s palace.

Because he was skilled with plants, he was taken on as an under-gardener. He spoke little, worked diligently, and kept his past a secret. In a hidden corner of the royal gardens, he planted the single seed he carried. He tended it carefully, and in time, a strange and beautiful plant grew, unlike any other in the gardens, but it bore no flowers. The other gardeners mocked him for tending a useless weed, but he persisted.

One night, under the bright light of the full moon, the duke (now known only as Johan the gardener) went to his hidden plant. As the moonlight struck it, a single, large flower unfurled its petals. It was darker than night, yet seemed to shimmer with captured starlight, and its scent was wondrous. It was the Midnight Bloom.

Now, the king of this land had a daughter who was troubled by sad dreams, and could find no joy in the daylight world. Doctors and wise men could do nothing for her. That night, the princess wandered sleeplessly into the gardens. Drawn by the strange, beautiful scent, she came upon Johan kneeling beside the Midnight Bloom.

She saw the flower, unlike any she had ever beheld, seeming to drink the moonlight. As she gazed upon it, the sadness lifted from her heart, and she felt a sense of peace she had not known before. ‘Gardener,’ she whispered, ‘what is this flower?’

‘It is the Midnight Bloom, Princess,’ Johan replied quietly. ‘It shares its peace only with the moon, and with those whose hearts are open to the quiet of the night.’

From then on, every night of the full moon, the princess would come to the garden, and Johan would watch over her as she sat near the Midnight Bloom, finding solace in its presence. She began to speak with the quiet gardener, finding a depth and gentleness in him that belied his humble station.

One day, ambassadors arrived from a neighbouring land – the land that had once belonged to Johan. They brought news that the treacherous cousin who had usurped the dukedom had died without heir, and the people cried out for the return of their true duke, though none knew where he had fled. The ambassadors carried with them a portrait of the missing duke.

The king received them in court, and the princess stood beside him. When the portrait was unveiled, the princess gasped. She looked from the portrait to the quiet gardener who tended the grounds, and whom she had seen kneeling by the magical flower. The resemblance was unmistakable, though the gardener was older and marked by sun and soil.

‘Father,’ she said, ‘this is no mere gardener. This is the lost duke!’

All eyes turned to Johan, who stood silently at the back of the hall, having come to deliver some herbs to the cook. He met the princess’s gaze, and knew his disguise was at an end. He stepped forward and bowed. ‘Princess,’ he said, ‘your eyes see truly. I am that duke, or was.’

The king was astonished. He questioned Johan, who told his story truthfully. The ambassadors rejoiced to have found their duke. The king, seeing the look that passed between his daughter and the duke, and knowing how the gardener had brought her the only peace she had known, said, ‘It seems fate brought you here for more than tending flowers. You have served humbly and well, and won my daughter’s regard, not as a duke but as a man. If she is willing, you shall marry her, and unite our kingdoms when you return to claim your own.’

The princess readily agreed. Johan, revealed as the duke, married the princess. He returned to his own land, acclaimed by his people, with his bride beside him.


The Weaver's Clever Daughter

There was once a poor weaver who had a daughter named Marta. She was not only fair to look upon, but had a wit as quick as her father’s shuttle. The king of that land was known to be stern but strangely fond of riddles and clever answers.

One day, the king, riding through the village, saw the weaver at his loom and stopped. ‘Good weaver,’ said the king, ‘they say your daughter is clever. Is this true?’

‘Sire,’ replied the weaver proudly, ‘she can untangle any knot, be it thread or trouble.’

‘We shall see,’ said the king. ‘Bring her to my castle tomorrow. If she can answer three questions I set her, I will reward you. If not, you shall pay a fine of ten gold pieces for your boasting.’

The weaver went home anxious, but Marta listened calmly. The next day, she dressed in her neatest, plainest clothes and went with her father to the castle.

The king sat on his throne. ‘Maiden,’ he said, ‘answer me this: What is the swiftest thing in the world?’

Marta curtsied and said, ‘Thought, Your Majesty. For thought can travel from one end of the world to the other in the blink of an eye.’

The king nodded, surprised. ‘Second question: What is the richest thing in the world?’

‘The earth, Your Majesty,’ answered Marta. ‘For out of the earth comes all the wealth that kings and commoners possess.’

The king stroked his beard. ‘And third: What is the sweetest thing in the world?’

‘Sleep, Your Majesty,’ said Marta. ‘For when sorrow or toil weighs heavy, sleep brings peace and restoration like nothing else.’

The king was impressed. ‘You have answered well,’ he said. ‘But true cleverness lies not just in words, but deeds. I will give you a task. Here is one pound of flax. Spin it into thread fine enough to weave a shirt for me, but you must do it between sunrise and sunset tomorrow. If you succeed, your father owes no fine, and you shall have this purse of silver. Fail, and the fine is doubled.’

Marta took the flax and went home. Her father despaired. ‘A pound of flax into a king’s shirt in one day! It is impossible!’

‘Do not worry, father,’ said Marta. She took a tiny splinter of wood from the flax bundle. The next morning, she returned to the castle and asked to see the king.

‘Your Majesty,’ she said, ‘I am ready to spin the flax and weave the shirt. But first, I need a loom. Will you have your carpenter make me one from this splinter of wood I hold? And it must be done between now and sunset, for that is the time I have for my task.’

The king stared at the tiny splinter, then at Marta, and burst into laughter. ‘Cleverly evaded, maiden!’ he said. ‘You have shown that an impossible task requires impossible tools. Your father owes no fine, and here is the purse of silver. Go now, your wit pleases me.’

Marta thanked the king and went home with the silver, and her father rejoiced that his daughter’s cleverness had saved him.

The Ungrateful Serpent

A farmer was walking home through the snow one cold winter evening when he saw something dark lying by the path. He drew near and found it was a serpent, stiff and frozen with the cold. The farmer had a kind heart, and though he knew serpents could be dangerous, he pitied the creature. ‘Poor thing,’ he said, ‘I cannot leave you here to die.’

He carefully picked up the frozen serpent, opened his thick coat, and placed the creature inside against his own warm body. He fastened his coat again and hurried home.

When he reached his cottage, he went straight to the hearth where a bright fire burned. He gently laid the serpent on the warm stones before the fire. His wife saw this and cried out, ‘Husband, what are you doing? That is a dangerous beast!’

‘It was freezing to death,’ said the farmer. ‘Let it warm itself; perhaps kindness will tame it.’

They watched as the serpent slowly began to thaw. It stirred, uncoiled itself, and lifted its head, its little eyes glittering in the firelight. Seeing the farmer and his wife, it suddenly hissed, opened its jaws wide, and lunged forward to bite the farmer’s hand – the very hand that had saved it.

The farmer, quick from years of farm work, snatched up the heavy iron poker from the hearth and struck the serpent dead with a single blow.

‘Alas,’ he said sadly to his wife, ‘some natures are so evil that no amount of kindness can change them. I learned a hard lesson this night.’



The Three Spinsters and the Idle Prince

In a kingdom famed for its fine linen lived a king whose only son was handsome but exceedingly idle. The prince cared for nothing but hunting all day and feasting all night. The king despaired, for the kingdom needed a future ruler who understood diligence.

One day, the king summoned his son. ‘Son,’ he said, ‘it is time you took a wife. But you shall only marry a princess who can spin the finest thread, weave the strongest cloth, and sew the most perfect shirt in a single day.’

The prince groaned. ‘Father, where can such a woman be found? It is an impossible task!’

‘Nevertheless,’ said the king, ‘those are my terms. Go forth and seek her.’

The prince, caring little for the task but eager to escape his father’s lectures, rode out. He travelled aimlessly, hunting as he went. After some days, he found himself lost in a deep wood. As night fell, he saw a light and came upon a tiny, tumbledown hut. Inside sat three very old women, spinning by the dim light of a single candle.

The first woman had a thumb as broad and flat as a shovel from constantly drawing the thread. The second had a lower lip so droopy it covered her chin, from moistening the thread as she spun. The third had a foot as wide and splayed as a goose’s, from working the treadle day in and day out.

‘Good evening, mothers,’ said the prince, amused by their strange looks. ‘Can you offer a lost hunter shelter for the night?’

‘Welcome, young sir,’ said the first, her broad thumb never pausing. ‘But we have little to offer.’

‘We work from dawn till dusk,’ said the second, her lip flapping as she spoke.

‘And barely earn our bread,’ finished the third, her foot tapping the floor rhythmically.

The prince, seeing their ceaseless work, suddenly remembered his father’s quest. A sly thought entered his head. ‘Mothers,’ he said, ‘I seek a bride who is skilled in spinning, weaving, and sewing. My father, the king, demands she make a shirt in a single day. Could any of you perform such a feat?’

The three old women looked at each other, then chuckled, a dry, rustling sound. ‘Perhaps we could, young sir,’ said the one with the broad thumb. ‘But what reward would there be for such labour?’

‘Reward?’ said the prince. ‘Why, marriage to me, the king’s son!’

‘Hmm,’ said the second woman, moistening her thread. ‘A prince for a husband… But we are old and ill-favoured.’

‘Ah,’ said the prince craftily, ‘my father asks only for the skill, not the beauty. If you can make the shirt, I shall claim you as my bride – whichever of you does the finest work.’ He thought to himself he would simply take the shirt and leave the ugly spinsters behind.

‘There is one condition,’ said the third woman, her foot tapping faster. ‘If we do this for you, you must promise not to be ashamed of us. You must call us your dear aunts, and invite us to sit at the high table at your wedding feast.’

The prince readily agreed, thinking the wedding feast would never happen, or if it did, he could easily hide them away. ‘I promise faithfully!’ he declared.

So, the next morning, the prince procured the finest flax. The first woman spun it with her broad thumb, drawing a thread so fine it was almost invisible. The second took the thread, moistened it with her droopy lip, and wove it on a hidden loom into cloth smoother and stronger than silk. The third took the cloth and, pressing the treadle with her wide foot, sewed a shirt so perfect that no seam could be seen. All this they did before the sun had set.

The prince marvelled at the shirt. He thanked the old women curtly, took the shirt, and rode away, forgetting his promise almost at once. He presented the shirt to his father, boasting of the princess he had found who made it.

The king was overjoyed. ‘You have found her!’ he cried. ‘Prepare for the wedding!’

The prince was married soon after to a neighbouring princess (for he never intended to marry the spinsters), and a great feast was prepared. As the prince sat beside his new bride at the high table, three carriages drew up to the palace gate. Out stepped the three old spinsters, dressed in strange, old-fashioned finery.

They hobbled into the hall. The prince turned pale when he saw them. They came straight to the high table. ‘Good day to you, dear nephew!’ croaked the first, showing her broad thumb.

‘Health to you, dear nephew!’ lisped the second, her lip flapping.

‘Joy to you, dear nephew!’ tapped the third, pointing to her wide foot.

The king stared. ‘Son,’ he asked, ‘who are these strange women?’

The prince flushed red, ashamed. He mumbled, ‘They are… some old aunts of mine.’

‘Aunts?’ said the king. ‘But how came they by such deformities? Tell me, good aunts, how did you get such broad thumbs, droopy lips, and splayed feet?’

‘Ah, Your Majesty,’ said the first, ‘from spinning, naught but spinning!’

‘Aye,’ said the second, ‘from weaving, day after day!’

‘Indeed,’ said the third, ‘from treadling the loom, year in, year out!’

The prince’s bride looked with horror at the deformed women, then at her own delicate hands and feet. She turned to the prince. ‘Husband,’ she declared firmly, ‘if this is what comes of spinning, weaving, and sewing, then I shall never touch spindle, loom, or needle again as long as I live! Let the maids do such work!’

And so, because of the prince’s forgotten promise and his shame, his bride remained as idle as he was, and the three old spinsters sat grinning at the high table, enjoying the best of the feast.

The Honest Spoon

There was once a merchant named Bartholomew who was exceedingly rich, but his heart was as hard and false as a lead coin painted gold. He cheated his customers, lied to his neighbours, and thought only of adding more coins to his overflowing chests. He ate fine food from silver plates, but cared naught for the poor folk who had barely a crust.

One day, travelling through a strange village far from his home, he saw an old pedlar sitting by the roadside. Before the pedlar lay a dusty cloth with a few odds and ends: a tarnished buckle, three bent nails, and a single spoon made of dark, dull wood. The merchant, always looking for a bargain he could twist to his advantage, scoffed. "What rubbish have you there, old man?"

The pedlar looked up, his eyes oddly bright. "Only what you see, master. But this spoon," he said, picking up the wooden spoon, "is worth more than you might think."

Bartholomew laughed. "That plain thing? I would not give you a copper for it."

"Perhaps not," said the pedlar softly. "But it has a virtue. He who eats with this spoon must speak only the truth."

The merchant’s eyes narrowed. A truth-telling spoon? What nonsense! But a cunning thought sparked in his mind. Such a spoon, if it truly worked, could be used to ferret out secrets, to expose rivals! He haggled fiercely, thinking the old man a fool, and finally bought the spoon for a single silver coin he claimed was his last (though his purse was heavy).

Returning home, Bartholomew invited his chief trading rival, a man named Justus whom he suspected of hiding a profitable venture, to supper. He laid the table with his finest silver, but placed the plain wooden spoon at Justus’s setting. "A simple spoon, from my travels," he said smoothly. "Use it, I pray you."

Justus picked up the spoon, looking puzzled, but began to eat the rich stew. Bartholomew leaned forward, his eyes gleaming. "Tell me, friend Justus," he began, "is it true you have found a new source of rare spices in the South?"

Justus opened his mouth, intending to deny it as he always did, but instead, the words tumbled out: "Aye, Bartholomew, it is true! A whole island, untouched! The profits will be immense, far greater than yours!" He clapped his hand over his mouth, aghast.

Bartholomew was delighted! It worked! But then Justus, still holding the spoon, looked at him sharply. "And is it true, Bartholomew," he asked, his voice trembling with anger and the spoon's compulsion, "that you bribed the harbour master to delay my ships last spring?"

Bartholomew opened his mouth to laugh it off, but the spoon’s magic, even from across the table, seemed to catch him. "Yes!" he heard himself declare loudly. "And I switched your cargo manifests too!"

The dinner ended in shouting and threats. Justus stormed out, vowing revenge and promising to reveal Bartholomew’s deceit to the whole town. The merchant was furious. The spoon was too dangerous!

He tried to throw it away, tossing it into the river. But the next morning, it lay gleaming wetly on his doorstep. He tried to burn it, but the flames would not touch the dark wood. He tried to bury it deep in his garden, but the following day, his cook found it sitting innocently in the soup ladle.

The spoon clung to him. And worse, its influence grew. He found himself blurting out truths at the market, admitting he watered the wine and used false weights. He confessed his dishonest deals to the town council. His wife learned of his secret debts, his servants learned how little he truly valued them, and the beggars learned he had vaults full of gold he denied possessing.

Soon, no one would trade with him. His rivals united to ruin him. His false friends deserted him. Stripped of his wealth and reputation, Bartholomew the merchant became Bartholomew the beggar, clothed in rags, shunned by all. He owned nothing in the world but the simple wooden spoon, which now lay unused, for he had no food to eat with it, and having lost everything, he found he had no lies left to tell. He lived out his days in miserable poverty, a stark warning that ill-gotten gains built on falsehood cannot endure the simple touch of truth.


Karl the Wheelbarrow

There once lived a farmer named Karl who had a terrible temper. When things went wrong, which they often did on his stony farm, he would bellow and roar, kick stones, and sometimes even break his own tools in fury. His wife, Marta, was a patient soul, but she often sighed, "Oh, Karl, your anger will carry you off one day!"

One afternoon, Karl was trying to fix a broken fence post while his prize pig rooted nearby. The pig, paying no heed, knocked over Karl’s pot of nails. They scattered into the long grass. Karl turned beet-red. "You wretched beast!" he roared, raising his fist. But before he could strike the pig, a strange tingling ran through him. He felt himself shrinking, hardening, changing. His legs became sturdy wooden handles, his arms vanished, his torso broadened into a deep wooden basin, and a single wheel sprouted beneath him. In the space of a breath, Karl the farmer was gone, and in his place stood a stout wooden wheelbarrow.

Marta came out, calling, "Karl? Supper is ready!" She saw the pig snuffling happily and the wheelbarrow standing oddly near the fence. "Karl?" she called again, puzzled. The wheelbarrow remained silent, but she noticed the wood seemed warm, and the handles looked strangely like... No, it couldn't be. Shaking her head, she went back inside.

Karl, trapped in wheelbarrow form, was horrified. He couldn't move unless pushed. He couldn't speak. He could only sit there, feeling the evening dew settle on his wooden basin. His anger had cooled into sheer terror. He remembered Marta's words, "Your anger will carry you off one day!" It seemed it had carried him into being a garden tool.

The next morning, Marta came out and, seeing the wheelbarrow, decided it was sturdy enough to use. She loaded Karl with weeds and pushed him to the compost heap. Karl silently endured the indignity. Later, young Fritz from the neighbouring farm borrowed him to carry stones. Fritz whistled cheerfully as he bumped Karl over the rough ground, unaware that the wheelbarrow was silently groaning.

Days turned into weeks. Karl remained a wheelbarrow. He learned that his transformation was tied to his temper. If someone nearby expressed great anger – like when the neighbour’s bull broke loose and the neighbour cursed mightily – Karl felt a slight easing, a loosening of his wooden form, but it wasn't enough. He needed his *own* anger to trigger the change back, but how could a wheelbarrow feel anger? He felt only misery and regret.

One market day, Marta decided to take some vegetables to town. She loaded them into Karl. As she pushed him along the road, they passed the village smithy. The blacksmith, a large man named Otto, was arguing furiously with a customer who refused to pay. Otto roared, swung his hammer, and brought it down mightily upon his anvil, missing it slightly and striking his own thumb. His bellow of rage and pain echoed through the village.

A powerful surge went through Karl. The blacksmith's overwhelming fury resonated with his own suppressed temper. He felt the wood soften, stretch. The wheel retracted, legs sprouted, arms reappeared. With a loud crack, the wheelbarrow vanished, and Karl stood there, dazed and dusty, amidst a pile of scattered turnips and carrots.

Marta shrieked in surprise. The blacksmith and customer stopped arguing, mouths agape. Karl looked down at his hands, felt his face. He was himself again! He felt no anger, only immense relief.

"Marta!" he cried, rushing to her. "It was me! Your anger carried me off, just as you said! But Otto's anger brought me back!"

From that day on, Karl was a changed man. Whenever he felt his temper rising, he remembered the feeling of being cold, hard wood, bumped over stones and filled with weeds. He learned to take deep breaths, to walk away, even to laugh when the pig knocked over his nails. He was still a farmer on a stony patch of land, but he was no longer Karl the Wheelbarrow, and for that, he was eternally grateful. And sometimes, when Otto the blacksmith was having a particularly frustrating day, Karl would send Marta over with a calming cup of herbal tea.


The Weaver and the Giant's Beard

Once, in a high mountain valley, lived a young weaver named Elspeth. She was known throughout the villages for the fineness of her thread and the beauty of her patterns, but she was poor, for the valley folk had little coin. Above the valley lived a cruel and foolish Giant, who owned all the best pastures and demanded heavy tribute. His greatest pride was his enormous, bushy black beard, which flowed down past his knees.

One year, the Giant demanded a tribute so heavy that the villagers despaired. They would surely starve come winter. Elspeth, though small, had a quick mind and a brave heart. She went to the village elder. "I will face the Giant," she said. "But I need the finest lock of wool from every sheep in the valley, dyed the colour of the midnight sky."

The villagers, though doubtful, gathered the wool, for they had no other hope. Elspeth spent three days and three nights spinning it into a single, incredibly fine thread, stronger than any rope, yet almost invisible in shadow. She dyed it black as pitch. Then, taking her smallest loom and the single shuttle wound with the magic thread, she climbed the mountain path to the Giant's cave.

The Giant was sitting outside, roaring with laughter as he counted his sacks of grain taken from the villagers. "Ho there, little gnat!" he bellowed when he saw Elspeth. "Have you brought me more tribute?"

Elspeth bowed low. "Great Giant," she said, her voice clear but respectful, "I have brought you no grain, for we have none left. But I have brought my skill. I can weave you a cloth finer than any mortal possesses, a cloth made of night itself."

The Giant guffawed, spraying pebbles. "Weave? You think I need your flimsy rags? My clothes are made of bearskin!"

"Ah," said Elspeth cunningly, "but this cloth I speak of is special. It can capture dreams. Weave it into your beard, mighty Giant, and you shall have only pleasant dreams forever."

The Giant, who was often troubled by nightmares of losing his beard or tripping over his own feet, grew interested. "Capture dreams, you say? Weave it into my beard? Show me this thread!"

Elspeth held up the shuttle. The thread was so fine and dark it seemed like a strand of shadow. The Giant squinted. "Bah! That flimsy thing? It would break!"

"Let me show you its strength, great one," Elspeth said. She quickly set up her tiny loom, anchoring one end to a stout rock near the Giant's foot. "Allow me just to tie the other end, for stability," she said, approaching his beard. Before the dull-witted Giant quite understood, she had deftly looped the end of the magic thread around a thick hank of his beard near the very bottom, securing it with a weaver's knot that tightened under pressure.

"Now," she said, moving back to the loom, "watch!" She began to weave, her shuttle flying back and forth. But she wasn't weaving cloth. She was subtly weaving the magic thread *through* the tangled depths of the Giant's massive beard, looping it around rocks on the ground, anchoring it to sturdy roots, passing it back and forth, creating an invisible, intricate net that bound the lower part of his beard to the mountainside itself. The thread was so fine and dark, the Giant noticed nothing but the rhythmic click-clack of the loom. He was already half-dozing, thinking of pleasant dreams.

After an hour, Elspeth cut the thread from the loom. "It is done, great Giant," she announced. "The dream-catcher is woven into the very fabric of your magnificent beard."

The Giant yawned mightily. "Good. Now be off with you, gnat, before I decide to use you as a toothpick."

Elspeth scurried away. As soon as she was safely down the path, she shouted back, "Oh, Giant! Look, a fearsome dragon approaches from the east!"

The Giant, startled from his doze, leaped to his feet in alarm. But he only got halfway up. The invisible net of magic thread, woven through his beard and anchored to the rocks and roots, held fast. He tugged, and the knots tightened. He roared and pulled, but he was tethered to the ground by his own magnificent beard. He thrashed and bellowed, but the fine thread, woven with skill and the strength of the whole valley's flock, would not break.

He raged all night, trapped by his pride and Elspeth's cunning. By morning, he was exhausted and humbled. The villagers, hearing the commotion, came up the mountain and found their tormentor helpless.

"Release me!" the Giant pleaded, his voice hoarse. "Release me, and I shall demand no tribute for seven years! And you can graze your flocks on my lower pastures!"

Elspeth approached cautiously. "Swear it by your beard, Giant," she commanded.

"I swear it by my beard!" he groaned.

Elspeth then took a small, sharp pair of shears from her weaving kit and carefully, painstakingly, cut the magic threads, freeing him. The Giant, chastened and sore, rubbed his neck and stomped back into his cave without another word.

The villagers rejoiced. Elspeth was hailed as a hero. They grazed their flocks on the lower pastures, and for seven years, they lived free from the Giant's demands. And Elspeth the weaver, though still poor in coin, was rich in honour and the gratitude of her people.


The Baker Whose Bread Flew Away

There was once a baker named Otto whose bread was good, but not remarkable. He worked hard, yet his shop was always emptier than that of his rival across the street, whose loaves were lighter and whose rolls were said to be favoured by the Mayor himself. Otto grew envious and wished constantly for a way to make his bread the best in the land.

One evening, mixing his dough by the weak light of a candle, he muttered, "Oh, I wish my bread were so light it could almost fly!"

He thought nothing more of it, finished his work, and went to bed. The next morning, he awoke to a delicious smell filling his shop. He opened the oven, and pulled out a tray of the most beautiful, golden, perfectly risen loaves he had ever seen. They were incredibly light, almost weightless in his hands.

"My wish!" he breathed, astonished. "It came true!"

He eagerly placed the loaves in his shop window. The first customer of the day was the Mayor's wife. She gasped at the sight of the bread. "Otto! Such perfection! I must have that largest loaf!"

Otto beamed, carefully lifting the magnificent loaf. But as he handed it to her, a sudden gust of wind blew through the open shop door. The loaf, light as a feather, lifted from his hands! It sailed gently out the door, caught the breeze, and floated up, up, over the rooftops like a plump, golden cloud.

The Mayor's wife shrieked. Otto stared, dumbfounded. More customers arrived, drawn by the commotion and the wonderful smell. Each time Otto tried to sell a loaf or even a small roll, the slightest puff of air – a door opening, someone sighing too deeply, a fan fluttering – would send the baked good drifting away into the sky.

His bread was indeed the lightest in the land, lighter than air itself! It was magnificent, perfect, and utterly impossible to sell or eat. People crowded his shop not to buy, but to watch in amazement as rolls bobbed near the ceiling and loaves escaped out the window. His rival baker came over, laughing until tears streamed down his face.

Otto was distraught. His wish had been granted too well. He tried making heavier dough, adding stones to the mixture (which broke his customers' teeth and did not fly), but any bread made *correctly* simply floated away. He tried baking indoors with all windows and doors sealed, but the moment a customer opened the door to leave, their purchase would make a bid for freedom.

He grew poorer and poorer, known only as the baker whose bread flew away. His shop filled with cobwebs, not customers. One day, sitting glumly amidst the lingering scent of unattainable bread, he sighed a different kind of wish. "Oh, I wish I had just made good, honest, *heavy* bread that people could actually eat!"

No sooner had he spoken than a plain, brown sparrow flew in the window. It landed on his counter and chirped loudly. Then it flew to his flour bin, pecked at it, flew to his water jug, pecked at it, and flew to his yeast pot, chirping all the while. Otto watched, bewildered.

"Are you trying to tell me something, little bird?" he asked wearily.

The sparrow chirped insistently. On impulse, Otto decided to follow the bird's apparent instructions. He mixed the flour, water, and yeast in the proportions the sparrow seemed to indicate by its pecking and chirping. He kneaded the dough – it felt solid, substantial. He baked it.

Out of the oven came a loaf that was… ordinary. It was brown, dense, and smelled simply of honest bread. It did not gleam, it did not rise to magnificent heights, and most importantly, it did not float. Otto picked it up. It had weight.

He cautiously opened the door. A breeze blew in. The loaf stayed firmly in his hand. A customer peered in, saw the plain loaf, and asked, "Is that one for sale, Otto? Or will it fly to the moon?"

"This one stays," said Otto, feeling a tear of gratitude roll down his cheek. He sold the loaf. It was not the best bread in the land, but it was good, honest, and satisfyingly heavy.

From that day on, Otto baked only the sparrow's plain, heavy bread. His shop slowly filled again with customers who wanted bread they could eat, not bread that tickled the fancy of the wind. He never became famous, but he earned his living, and he learned that wishing for flighty perfection is less worthy than appreciating solid, earthly sustenance. And he always left crumbs out for the sparrows.



Magda the Magpie and the Riddle-Stone

In a tall oak beside a king's castle lived a magpie named Magda. She was cleverer than all the other magpies, and prouder too, for she loved not shiny trinkets, but riddles. She would listen to the nurses telling riddles to the royal children in the garden, and she learned them all. Her greatest treasure was a smooth, grey stone she kept hidden in her nest, which she called her Riddle-Stone, though it had no magic but what she imagined.

One day, the King's youngest daughter, Princess Aurelia, lost her favourite silver locket while playing near the oak tree. It had a picture of her departed mother inside, and she wept bitterly. The King offered a great reward – a bag of gold and a place at court – to anyone who could find it.

Knights searched the gardens, ladies sifted the flowerbeds, and gardeners trimmed the hedges bare, but the locket was not found. Magda watched all this from her high branch, preening her glossy feathers. She knew where the locket was. A clumsy squirrel had knocked it from the princess’s hand, and it had fallen into a deep crack in the oak tree's trunk, quite hidden from view.

Magda thought, "A bag of gold is useless to a magpie, and court is too noisy. But perhaps I can have some sport."

She flew down and landed near the weeping princess. "Princess, cease your tears!" she chattered, for she could mimic speech passably well when she chose. "I know where your silver lies hidden."

Aurelia looked up in astonishment. "A talking bird? You know where my locket is?"

"Aye," squawked Magda, puffing her chest. "But knowledge has its price. Answer me a riddle, and I shall tell you."

The princess, desperate, agreed. Magda tilted her head and asked the first riddle she had learned:
"What has an eye, but cannot see?"

Aurelia thought for a moment, wiping her eyes. "A needle!" she cried.

"Correct!" chattered Magda. "Now, listen well. Your locket lies..." But then her pride got the better of her. Why give the answer so easily? "It lies," she continued slyly, "where wood meets wood, deep and dark, yet high above the ground." This was true – the crack was in the trunk above the ground – but purposefully vague.

The princess, confused, thanked Magda and ran to tell her father. They searched every wooden fence, gate, and bench in the garden, but found nothing.

Magda watched, amused. The next day, she flew down again. "Still searching, Princess? Perhaps another riddle will clear the path?"

Aurelia readily agreed. Magda asked:
"What has a neck, but has no head?"

"A bottle!" answered the princess promptly.

"Sharp you are!" Magda chirped. "Now, the locket rests where the squirrel rests, and the owl sleeps, but not in a nest." Again, true, but misleading.

The searchers now inspected every hollow log and wooden birdhouse. Still no locket.

On the third day, Magda, puffed with importance, approached the princess again. "One final riddle, Princess, for the final clue." She asked her favourite:
"I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?"

This was harder. Aurelia frowned in concentration. She thought of the castle, the royal woods, the fishpond. At last, her face brightened. "A map!"

Magda clicked her beak in appreciation. "Indeed! A map shows the way! Now, look not on the map, but be the map! Stand where the shadow of the tallest branch falls at noon, face the oldest stone of the castle wall, and take three hops forward. There you will find your prize."

This clue was born entirely of Magda’s whim, a riddle in itself. It had nothing to do with the crack in the tree. She just wanted to see what would happen.

Following the bizarre instructions, the princess found herself standing before the ancient oak tree itself. Taking three hops forward brought her right to the base of the trunk. Puzzled, she looked up, scanning the bark. And there, just above her head, nestled deep in a shadowed crack she had never noticed before, she saw a glint of silver. With a cry of joy, she reached in and pulled out her lost locket.

The King was overjoyed and amazed at the cleverness of the riddling magpie. He offered Magda the bag of gold, but she just cocked her head and chattered, "Gold buys no grubs! Riddles are my reward!"

He then offered her the place at court, but she ruffled her feathers. "Too many cats!"

So, the King proclaimed Magda the Royal Riddler. He commanded that every day a bowl of fresh mealworms and shiny beetles (which Magda *did* like) be placed at the foot of the oak tree. And whenever the King or his councillors were perplexed by a difficult problem, they would go to the oak tree and call for Magda. She wouldn't solve their problems, but she would pose riddles, and sometimes, in puzzling out the answers, they found the clarity they sought. Magda lived long and happily in her oak, the cleverest, proudest, and best-fed magpie in the kingdom, guarding her plain grey Riddle-Stone which, everyone agreed, must surely be magic after all.


The Soldier Who Found a Talking Kettle

There was once a soldier named Friedrich who had seen too much of war. He was brave enough, but tired of marching, fighting, and sleeping on hard ground. When the war ended, he received three copper coins for his service and was turned loose. "What now?" he thought. "I seek not riches, but a quiet life. Perhaps some great danger overcome will grant me peace?" For he had heard tales of heroes winning kingdoms or quiet manors through daring deeds.

So, Friedrich decided to seek out the most dangerous place he could find, hoping for a quest that would lead to quiet retirement. He heard tell of a haunted forest where no woodcutter dared enter, for strange noises were heard, and travellers vanished. "Perfect," thought Friedrich. "A ghost, a monster, perhaps a dragon! I shall vanquish it and be rewarded with calm."

He bought a stale loaf with one copper, sharpened his old sword with another, and used the third to buy a small, battered iron kettle to boil water on his journey. Then he marched into the haunted forest.

The forest was indeed gloomy and silent. No birds sang, no squirrels chattered. Friedrich walked all day, his hand on his sword, expecting horrors at every turn. But nothing happened. As night fell, he found a small clearing and decided to make camp. He gathered dry twigs and tried to start a fire. His flint and steel were damp; sparks flew but caught nothing.

"Blast!" muttered Friedrich, weary and hungry. "No fire, no hot water, no monster. Just damp wood and silence."

Suddenly, a small, tinny voice spoke from beside him. "Perhaps I can help?"

Friedrich leaped up, sword drawn. "Who's there?" He looked around wildly. No one.

"Down here," said the voice.

Friedrich looked down. The voice seemed to come from... his kettle. He stared at the battered iron pot. "Did... did you speak?"

"Of course, I spoke," said the kettle tartly. "Been waiting all day for you to need something. You're not very observant for a soldier looking for danger. Now, about that fire..."

Friedrich gaped. A talking kettle! This was certainly strange, though not the fearsome monster he'd expected. "You can make fire?"

"I *am* fire, in a way," said the kettle. "Or I hold it. Tip me over."

Hesitantly, Friedrich tipped the kettle onto the pile of twigs. A handful of perfectly dry, glowing red coals spilled out. The twigs immediately caught light, crackling merrily.

"Well, I'll be..." Friedrich breathed. He quickly added more wood, and soon had a cheerful blaze. He filled the kettle with water from his flask. "Can you boil yourself?"

"Naturally," said the kettle. "Just put me on the fire like any sensible person would."

Friedrich did so, and the water boiled in moments. He soaked his stale bread in the hot water, making a passable meal. "Thank you, kettle," he said sincerely. "You're more useful than my sword today."

"Swords break things. Kettles make tea," replied the kettle smugly. "What brings a soldier seeking danger to this quiet wood?"

Friedrich explained his odd quest for peace through peril. The kettle seemed to chuckle, a low rumbling sound. "Danger isn't always loud, soldier. And peace isn't always won by fighting. Sometimes it's found by sitting still. This forest isn't haunted by ghosts, it's haunted by *quiet*. Too much quiet drove the woodcutters mad. They preferred axes and shouting."

They talked long into the night, the soldier and the kettle. Friedrich found the kettle surprisingly knowledgeable about herbs, weather, and the ways of the forest. It seemed the kettle had been sitting in that clearing for a very long time.

The next morning, Friedrich felt strangely reluctant to leave. The fire, easily rekindled with coals from the kettle, was warm. The kettle offered advice on finding edible berries. The silence no longer felt menacing, but calm.

"I suppose I should seek my danger," Friedrich said doubtfully.

"Or," suggested the kettle, "you could build a small hut right here. Good clay by the stream, plenty of wood. Quiet neighbours."

Friedrich looked at the kettle, then around the peaceful clearing. Build a hut? Settle down? It was the opposite of his plan, yet... it felt right. He stayed. Using the kettle's coals for his forge-fire (built with the kettle's advice on finding the right stones), he used his old sword to chop wood and shape timbers. He found the clay and made simple bricks. The kettle, perched nearby, offered constant, practical advice.

Weeks turned into months. Friedrich built a snug little hut. He learned to trap small game, identify herbs, and live with the profound quiet of the forest. He rarely thought of fighting monsters. His life was simple, hardworking, and peaceful. The kettle was his constant companion, providing fire, hot water, and surprisingly sensible conversation.

One day, a lost merchant stumbled into the clearing, terrified of the "haunted" woods. Friedrich calmly gave him shelter, warm food cooked over the kettle's coals, and directions back to the main road. The merchant, amazed at the cozy homestead in the dreaded forest, offered Friedrich gold for his kindness.

"Keep your gold," Friedrich said. "But if you pass this way again, perhaps bring some tea leaves? My kettle has a fondness for a good brew."

Friedrich lived out his days in the quiet forest, a soldier who sought danger but found peace in the company of a talking kettle. His sword rusted by the hearth, but his kettle gleamed brightly, always ready with a warm coal and a wise word.

The Woman Whose Tongue Turned to Thistles

In a village known for its fine linen lived a woman named Agnes. She was neither rich nor poor, hardworking at her loom, but possessed of one great fault: she loved to gossip more than she loved her own supper. No secret was safe with her, no rumour left unstirred, no reputation left unsullied by her wagging tongue. If she heard a whisper at the well, it became a shout at the market. If she saw a neighbour stumble, she told the village he was a drunkard. Her words were like nettles, stinging harmless folk for her own sour amusement.

Her husband, a quiet man named Thomas, often sighed, "Agnes, hold your tongue. Such sharp words will bring you sorrow."

"Nonsense!" Agnes would retort. "Words are only air. What harm can they do?" And she would hurry off to share the latest tidbit she had embroidered with malice.

One afternoon, Agnes sat spinning with her neighbours. The talk turned to the miller's daughter, a shy girl named Clara, who was soon to be wed. Agnes leaned in conspiratorially. "Have you heard," she whispered loudly, though Clara's own cousin sat nearby, "that the bridegroom only offered for her because his first choice, the blacksmith's girl, refused him flat? And they say Clara..." Agnes paused for effect, then launched into a cruel and entirely fabricated tale about Clara's character.

The cousin gasped, tears welling in her eyes, and fled the room. The other women looked down, suddenly ashamed to be listening. But Agnes felt a thrill of importance.

That night, however, Agnes awoke with a strange feeling in her mouth. It was dry, scratchy, and oddly full. She went to get a drink of water, but found she could barely swallow. Alarmed, she went to the small looking-glass she owned. When she opened her mouth to see what was wrong, she screamed, but no sound came out. Her tongue was gone. In its place, crammed into her mouth, was a clump of sharp, prickly, purple-flowered thistles.

She tried frantically to pull them out, but the thorns dug into the roof of her mouth and the sides of her cheeks, drawing blood. Each time she tugged, the thistles seemed to grip tighter, the thorns sink deeper. She could not speak, she could not eat, she could barely drink. Water trickled painfully past the prickly mass.

Thomas found her weeping silently, pointing desperately at her mouth. When he saw the thistles, he understood at once. "Alas, Agnes!" he cried, remembering her cruel gossip about poor Clara. "Your sharp words have borne bitter fruit! Your tongue has become what it dispensed – thorns and thistles!"

Agnes lived in misery. She grew thin and weak, unable to eat solid food. She could only communicate through gestures and sorrowful eyes. When she tried to gesture gossip, pointing fingers and mimicking whispers, the thistles in her mouth seemed to prickle even more fiercely. She could no longer sit with the neighbours, for they pitied and slightly feared her. The silence she had despised in others became her own prison.

She began to spend her days alone, tending a small patch of herbs behind their cottage. One day, weeding amongst the mint and thyme, she saw shy Clara pass by on the lane, looking pale and drawn. Remorse washed over Agnes. She longed to apologize, to take back her poisonous words, but she could make no sound. On impulse, she quickly gathered a small bunch of her sweetest smelling thyme and offered it to Clara with a look of deep regret in her eyes.

Clara hesitated, then seeing Agnes's genuine sorrow and her terrible affliction, she softened. She accepted the herbs with a small, sad smile and went on her way.

As Agnes watched her go, she felt a slight easing in her mouth. It wasn't much, but one of the sharpest thistle thorns seemed to retract slightly. Hope flickered within her. Could kindness undo the curse?

From that day, Agnes changed her ways entirely. Unable to speak gossip, she began to *do* kindness. She left anonymous bundles of firewood for the old widow. She mended clothes for the orphans. She shared her herbs freely. She offered silent comfort to those in sorrow. And whenever she saw someone she had wronged with her past words, she would offer them a small, humble gift – a flower, a polished pebble, a piece of bread saved from her own meagre, liquid diet – her eyes conveying the apology she could not speak.

Slowly, painstakingly, with each act of genuine kindness and contrition, the thistles in her mouth began to recede. A sharp leaf would wither, a thorn would soften and fall away. It took many seasons, but eventually, one morning, Agnes awoke and felt something different. Hesitantly, she looked in the glass. The last vestige of the thistles was gone, and in its place was a small, pink, ordinary tongue.

She touched it carefully. "Hello?" she whispered. Her voice was weak and rusty from disuse, but it was hers. Tears of gratitude streamed down her face.

Agnes never returned to her gossiping ways. Her tongue, once a weapon, now spoke only quiet, necessary, and kindly words. And the villagers learned to hold their own tongues, remembering the woman whose gossip had literally filled her mouth with thorns.


Lazy Leo and the Sky-Root

Leo was quite possibly the laziest man in the Seven Valleys. He lived in a tumbledown hut at the edge of the village, and his greatest ambition was to find a way to lie in the sun all day without needing to work for his supper. His scrap of garden was overgrown with weeds, save for one corner where his tired old mother had, years ago, planted a single, stubborn bean seed of a variety no one quite remembered. Leo mostly ignored it.

One spring morning, Leo was lying on his back, watching the clouds, and idly tossed a bucket of dirty dishwater out the door. Much of it landed, by chance, on the forgotten bean plant's corner. Leo yawned and went back to his nap.

He awoke later that afternoon to a strange scraping sound. He looked out. A thick, green vine, thicker than his arm, was climbing rapidly up the side of his hut, already reaching the roof. It had burst from the spot where the bean seed lay.

"Well, that's odd," thought Leo, mildly interested. "Must have been thirsty." He went back to sleep.

The next morning, the vine towered over his hut, reaching high into the sky, so high he couldn't see the top. It looked less like a beanstalk and more like a gnarled, green root growing downwards *from* the sky. Birds were perching on its side-shoots.

"Hmm," Leo mused, scratching his head. "Might be cooler up there." Laziness, rather than courage or curiosity, prompted him. He grabbed hold of the rough bark of the Sky-Root, as he decided to call it, and began to climb. It was surprisingly easy; the knobs and side-shoots made perfect handholds.

He climbed for what seemed like hours, passing through the clouds. Above the clouds, the Sky-Root emerged into dazzling sunlight. It didn't end, but seemed to spread out, forming a sort of vast, green, upside-down forest canopy high above. And hanging from the smaller tendrils were not leaves, but... biscuits! Golden-brown, perfectly baked biscuits dangled everywhere like fruit.

Leo's eyes widened. He plucked one. It was warm and delicious. He plucked another, and another. He ate his fill, then lay back on a broad, root-like branch, basking in the sun. "This is the life!" he sighed happily. Free food, warm sun, no work.

He stayed up there for three days, eating biscuits and sleeping. He noticed other things hanging from the Sky-Root: occasionally a waterskin filled with cool, clear water, sometimes a pouch of roasted nuts, once even a small cooked chicken. It seemed the Sky-Root provided everything needed for a lazy existence.

On the fourth day, however, he saw something else climbing the Sky-Root from below. It was Grumbald, the Mayor's stout and greedy son, who was famous for always wanting what others had. Grumbald had seen the giant root from the village and, driven by envy and ambition, had decided to climb it himself.

"Ho there, Lazy Leo!" Grumbald puffed as he reached Leo's level. "What's this place? Have you found treasure?" He saw the biscuits. "Biscuits! Growing on a root! I'll claim this Sky-Root for my father!"

Grumbald started grabbing biscuits greedily, stuffing his pockets. He tried to pull down a whole branch laden with them. But the Sky-Root seemed... displeased. The branch Grumbald tugged suddenly writhed like a snake, slapping him hard across the face. The biscuits he had stuffed in his pockets turned instantly to hard, inedible pebbles.

"Ouch! Hey!" yelled Grumbald. He kicked the root in anger.

The Sky-Root shuddered. The branch Leo was lying on dipped alarmingly. Far below, the ground seemed impossibly distant.

"Don't make it angry!" Leo yelped, clinging on. He wasn't brave, just concerned for his comfortable napping spot.

But Grumbald, furious at being denied, drew a small axe he had brought and began hacking at a smaller dangling root from which hung a plump waterskin. "I'll take what I want!" he snarled.

The moment the axe struck, the entire Sky-Root gave a mighty shudder. A deep groan echoed through the air. The root Grumbald was hacking at recoiled violently, striking him squarely in the chest and sending him tumbling off into the empty blue sky with a surprised yell. They never saw him again.

The Sky-Root then began to *pull itself up*. The massive root slowly, steadily, withdrew back into the sky from whence it came. Leo clung on desperately as his perch was drawn higher and higher. Finally, the very tip of the root lifted from his garden patch below, leaving only a shallow hole. The Sky-Root vanished completely back above the clouds.

Leo found himself deposited gently not back in his garden, but on a soft cloud bank. The Sky-Root was gone. There were no more biscuits. He was alone, high above the world.

"Oh dear," thought Leo. "This requires effort."

He eventually found his way down by jumping from cloud to cloud (which were surprisingly bouncy) and finally sliding down a long sunbeam when the clouds parted, landing with a soft thump in a haystack miles from his home.

He had to walk back to his village, which took two whole days – more work than he'd done in years. He arrived tired, hungry, and biscuit-less. The hole where the Sky-Root had been was just a hole. His hut looked even more tumbledown.

Leo sighed. It seemed his perfect lazy life was unattainable. With no Sky-Root biscuits, he realised he would actually have to weed his garden if he wanted to eat. He picked up a hoe. It felt terribly heavy. But the memory of falling from the sky, and the thought of having absolutely nothing to eat, was motivation enough. Leo, the laziest man in the Seven Valleys, actually began to work. Just a little bit.


The Tailor's Left Shoe

There once was a tailor named Simon, known for his fine stitching but also for his sharp tongue and tendency to cheat his customers just a little – an extra inch of cloth kept here, a lesser quality thread used there. He lived alone, save for a cat, and counted his coins each night with satisfaction.

One winter, a poor widow came to him, needing a sturdy pair of shoes for her son who had to walk miles to chop wood. She gave Simon her last silver piece and a good piece of leather she had saved for years. "Make them strong and true, Master Tailor," she pleaded. "His old ones let in the snow."

Simon, seeing the quality of the leather, made the right shoe perfectly well, strong and tightly stitched. But for the left shoe, his greed got the better of him. He used thinner thread, weaker stitches hidden on the inside, and even stretched the leather slightly so he could keep a small scrap for himself. He gave the pair to the widow, assuring her they were the finest work.

The boy wore the shoes. The right one held up admirably, but the left one soon began to leak. Stitches popped, the sole loosened, and the boy's foot was always cold and damp. One freezing day, struggling home through deep snow, the left shoe failed entirely. The boy stumbled, fell into a hidden drift, and took a chill so deep he fell gravely ill. The widow wept, blaming Simon's shoddy work.

She went to confront the tailor, but Simon, seeing her coming, quickly hid the leftover scrap of leather and denied everything. "My work is perfect!" he declared. "Your son must have misused the shoes! Be gone, woman!" He slammed the door in her face.

That night, a strange thing happened. As Simon slept, the ruined left shoe, which the widow had thrown down in despair outside his shop, began to twitch. A single loose thread stiffened like a wire. The worn sole tapped on the cobblestones. Slowly, awkwardly, the empty leather shoe began to hop, hop, hopping through the deserted streets.

It hopped to the Mayor's house and tapped on the door until a sleepy servant answered. The shoe hopped inside, straight into the Mayor's study, and hopped onto his desk, right beside his inkwell. It then hopped *into* the inkwell, soaking its tattered sole, and hopped back out, leaving a clear, black footprint on an important town document. Then it hopped away.

Next, the shoe hopped to the house of the richest merchant in town, known for his vanity. It hopped up onto his window ledge, where his prize-winning white cat slept. The shoe nudged the cat gently until it awoke, then hopped down, leaving a faint trail of inky water. The startled cat, curious, followed the trail, leaving its own paw prints alongside the shoe's path, leading away from the merchant's house.

Finally, the shoe hopped back to Simon's shop. It hopped onto his cutting table, where lay the scrap of fine leather Simon had stolen from the widow. The shoe dipped its inky sole again (using the last dregs from its journey) and hopped squarely onto the centre of the leather scrap, leaving one final, damning footprint. Then, its task seemingly done, it hopped into a dark corner and lay still.

The next morning, chaos erupted. The Mayor found the footprint on his document and roared for the town watch. The merchant found his prize cat missing (it had followed the shoe's trail out of town and got lost) and accused his rivals of theft, pointing to the strange prints. But the widow, seeing the commotion, went to the Mayor. "That footprint," she said, holding up the boy's sturdy right shoe, "looks like the sole of my son's shoe! The left one, made by Simon the Tailor, failed him!"

The Mayor, the merchant, and the watch marched to Simon's shop. Simon denied everything, blustering and shouting. But the Mayor spotted the cutting table. There lay the scrap of fine leather, and upon it, clear as day, was the inky footprint of a left shoe, identical to the one on his document and matching the widow's right shoe.

Simon turned pale. He could not explain the leather scrap or the footprint. His lies caught up with him. Faced with the evidence, he confessed his deceit.

The Mayor ordered Simon to pay the widow compensation enough to care for her sick son (who eventually recovered) and to buy him three pairs of the finest shoes. Simon's reputation was ruined, his customers left him, and he lived out his days patching worn clothes, his fine tailoring skills wasted, forever remembering the night a single, ruined shoe hopped through the town to deliver justice. The left shoe itself was never seen again; perhaps it hopped away satisfied, or perhaps it simply fell apart into dust and thread in its dark corner.


The Innkeeper Whose Hearth Went Cold

There stood an inn by the crossroads called The Weary Traveller, kept by a man named Silas. He brewed passable ale and offered clean beds, but his heart was pinched, and he measured generosity by the clink of coin. He smiled when purses were full, but his face grew stony if a traveller looked poor.

One biting winter evening, when snow lay thick upon the ground and the wind howled like a wolf, an old woman knocked weakly at the inn door. She was wrapped in thin, ragged shawls, and ice clung to her white hair. "Good innkeeper," she rasped, her voice thin as frost, "pray let me warm myself by your fire for but an hour. I have no coin, but I am frozen to the bone."

Silas peered out, saw her poverty, and scowled. "No coin, no comfort," he snapped. "My fire warms those who pay. Be off with you, beggar woman, before you bring your chill into my clean inn." And he slammed the heavy oak door shut, bolting it fast. He turned back to his roaring hearth, rubbing his hands together, congratulating himself on saving a log of wood.

He heard no more from the old woman. But a moment later, a strange coldness seeped into the room. The great fire in the hearth, which had blazed merrily, suddenly sank. The flames dwindled, turned blue, then vanished utterly, leaving only cold, grey ashes. A chill, far deeper than the winter wind outside, settled over the hearthstone.

Silas stared, bewildered. He threw on more dry logs, used the bellows till his arms ached, struck his flint and steel until sparks showered – but the hearth remained stone cold. No flame would catch. It was as if the very idea of fire had forgotten that spot.

Confused and angry, Silas went to light the smaller stove in the kitchen. It too remained cold. He tried to light a candle – the wick blackened but would not take flame. Panic began to rise in him. His paying guests upstairs started complaining about the freezing rooms.

From that night on, no fire could be kindled within The Weary Traveller. The hearth was cold, the stove unusable, candles would not light, lamps would not burn. Silas had to buy cooked food from the village, his ale grew cold and unpopular, and his guests shivered and soon departed for warmer lodgings. His inn, once bustling, became a cold, deserted shell.

Silas grew desperate. He bought expensive, blessed tinderboxes; he hired travelling wizards who muttered charms; he even rebuilt the great hearth with new stones. Nothing worked. Fire itself shunned his inn. His wealth dwindled, his hands grew chapped with cold, and he spent his nights huddled under blankets, shivering where his warm fire once roared.

One evening, exactly a year later, sitting alone in his freezing inn, he heard a faint tapping. Thinking it was the wind, he ignored it. But it came again, persistent. Grumbling, he unbolted the door.

There stood the same old woman, looking no different than the year before, despite the milder weather. She carried a single, unlit taper. She looked at Silas, huddled and shivering in his own inn, and her eyes held no anger, only a deep coldness.

"Good innkeeper," she said, her voice clear now, "do you have a light for my candle? I wish to find my way."

Silas looked at her, then at his useless flint and steel, his unlightable lamps. He thought of the warmth he had denied her, the warmth that had then fled his own life. Shame washed over him, colder than the chill in his bones.

"Alas, mother," he stammered, his teeth chattering, "I have no fire to give. No spark will live within these walls."

The old woman looked past him at the dead, grey hearth. "No warmth given, no warmth kept," she said softly. She held out her taper. "Perhaps a neighbour has fire?"

Silas hesitated. Then, ashamed and desperate, he nodded. He took the taper, wrapped his cloak tightly, and stepped out into the night, leaving his door unbolted. He went to the nearest cottage, where a baker lived, and knocked humbly. The baker, surprised to see the proud innkeeper looking so wretched, nonetheless shared a flame from his oven.

Silas carefully shielded the tiny flame and carried the lit taper back to his inn. The old woman was waiting patiently. He held out the flickering taper to her.

She took it, and her eyes met his. "Warmth shared is warmth earned," she said. She touched the flame of her taper to the cold ashes in Silas's hearth.

Instantly, a small, bright flame sprang up. It grew steadily, catching the old logs, rising into a cheerful, warm blaze. The icy chill in the room retreated. Silas gasped, feeling warmth on his face for the first time in a year.

He turned to thank the old woman, but she was gone. Only the lit taper remained, standing upright on the hearthstone, burning brightly.

Silas never returned to his miserly ways. He learned that a warm hearth depended not just on wood, but on a warm heart. He welcomed poor travellers, shared his fire freely, and though he never became rich again, his inn was known once more as a place of comfort, kept warm by the memory of the cold and the simple magic of shared kindness.

The Wanderings of a Copper Penny


Once upon a time, there was a copper penny. It was new made, all shiny and bright. An old woman got the penny first; she dwelt near the town and sold herbs. She earned the penny and thought, "With this, I will buy a ribbon for my granddaughter on the morrow." The penny felt it was meant for good things.

But as the old woman walked home, the day nigh spent, alas, the penny slipped from a hole in her old pouch. It fell onto the dusty road, and she knew naught of it.

So the penny lay in the dust. It could not be spent, and it was sad. Soon, a rich merchant came by in his carriage. A wheel struck the penny and tossed it up, so it landed inside the carriage, near the merchant's boot. The penny thought, "Now I shall be used."

Then the merchant saw the penny. "Bah, small change," said he, and tossed it into his great purse. Gold coins and silver coins dwelt there, and the penny felt small amongst them. When the merchant bought fine silk, he paid with gold. When he bought wine, he paid with silver. The penny was not used at all, but just rattled about. At last, the merchant grew tired of the weight of small coins. He came to the city gate where he saw a beggar sitting. The merchant threw the penny, and some others like it, to the poor man.

"Perhaps the poor need me more," thought the penny as it landed in the beggar's rough hand. The beggar looked at the few coins. He bought a hard crust of bread with two pennies, and kept our penny clutched tight in his hand. "He holds me dear," thought the penny. But that night, the beggar slept in a cold alley. Then came a thief, quiet as a mouse, and stole the penny from the sleeping beggar's hand.

The penny wished it could cry out, "Stop, thief!" But it was only metal. The thief hurried away and used the penny, with others he had stolen, to pay a ship captain. The ship was sailing to distant lands across the wide world. So the penny went into the captain's pocket. It thought, "Now I shall see adventure."

But the sea journey was hard. A great storm came, and the waves rose like mountains. The captain leaned over the side of the ship. Then the penny slipped from his pocket and fell down, down into the dark, churning sea.

"Lost! I am lost!" thought the penny. It sank to the sea bottom, where it lay among the sand and the waving seaweed. Many a time did the sun rise and set, and years went by. The penny grew dull and turned green like moss. Crabs crawled over it, and fish swam past. It seemed its use was gone forever.

Then one day, another great storm raged. It stirred the sea from its deepest parts. A strong current lifted the penny and tossed it this way and that, hither and thither. At last, the current threw the penny onto the shore, where it landed among the pebbles and shells on a lonely beach, far away.

Presently, a youth came walking along the beach. He was the son of a poor fisherman, looking for firewood. His eye fell upon a dull green thing among the stones. He picked it up and rubbed it hard. Then he saw the faint shape of the king's head.

"A coin!" cried he. "An old coin!" He had never held a coin before in his life, so he clutched it tight. "He sees me!" thought the penny, feeling a little bit important again.

The youth ran home as quick as lightning to the little hut made of driftwood. His mother, a poor widow, was inside. "Look, Mother!" he shouted. "I found treasure!"

His mother took the penny, and her eyes filled with tears. "Oh, my child," said she. "This copper piece... it is just enough. The trader in the village has one small spool of good thread. With this coin, I can buy it. Then I can mend your father's old fishing net. We shall have fish, and we shall not hunger this winter." She greatly rejoiced.

So the mother took the penny to the village trader. She gave him the coin, and he gave her the good thread. The trader tossed the old penny into a clay jar with other worn coins.

The penny did not mind being with the others now. It had travelled the wide world. It had seen rich men and poor men. It had been stolen and lost in the deep sea. But at last, it had come where it was needed most. It had bought thread to mend a net; it had brought hope. Its journey was long, but its purpose was met. And in the trader's dusty jar, the copper penny rested, dull but content to its heart's content. And perhaps it rests there still.



The Boy Who Learned the Wind's Name

Once upon a time, high on a wind-swept mountain, there dwelt folk in a small village. The North Wind blew hard there. It swept the dust away in summer, but alas, it could also flatten the houses and tear away the thatch. The folk feared the wind.

There was an old tale told among them. It said the wind had a True Name, known only to the oldest stones and trees. And if a body knew this name, he might gain some knowing of the wind's ways, and perhaps speak with it.

A youth named Thomas dwelt in the village. He was no hero, nor was he book-learned. He was but a quiet boy. He helped his father mend the stone walls around their fields, which the wind pushed down many a time. He saw how the wind was fickle; sometimes it sighed like a babe, other times it roared like a beast. He saw the folk leave gifts of grain and sometimes a ribbon tied to a post, hoping to soothe the wind, but the wind paid them no mind and blew as it would.

But one year, the North Wind blew with great anger, day after day, week after week. It blew so hard that it flattened the fields of barley just as the grain was ripening. Hunger was nigh upon the village. The old folk sighed, and the women wept bitterly. They left bigger gifts, but the wind only howled the louder.

Thomas watched the poor, flat barley lying on the earth. He remembered the old tale of the True Name. The youth thought, "If I could but ask the wind why it blows so hard, mayhap it would hark to me."

So he decided he would seek the name. He went to the oldest wife in the village, whose grandmother had told her many tales. "Good mother," said he, "know you aught of the wind's True Name?"

The old wife looked at him kindly. "Hark ye," she whispered, her voice dry like leaves, "the old tales say the name is hidden. It is where three old things meet and speak. Seek the Standing Stones out on the Grey Moor. Then find the oldest Rowan tree that grows beside the Hidden Spring. Prithee, listen well. Mayhap they remember the name."

Thomas thanked the old wife and made ready. He took only a skin of water and a hard crust of bread. His heart beat fast, but he had a strong will, for the village folk were in great need. So the youth betook himself out onto the wide moor.

He walked for three days, and the wind blew hard against him. At last, he found the great Standing Stones in a circle. They were grey and cold as death. He sat among them, sheltering a little from the gale. The wind howled and moaned all about him. He put his ear close to the cold stone. He listened long, long. Naught did he hear but the wind's cry. But just as the sun began to sink low, there came a quiet moment. Then he heard, or felt deep inside the stone, a humming sound, deep and slow: "BOR." It was but one part of a word. Then the wind rose again, loud as thunder, and he heard naught more.

"Bor?" thought the youth. "That is not the whole." He rose and went on his way. He followed old sheep tracks until he came to where twisted Rowan trees grew among the rocks. He sought the oldest one. Its trunk was grey and scarred, and its branches clawed at the sky like old fingers. He climbed into its lower arms, out of the worst of the wind, and laid his head against the ancient wood. He listened to the creaking of the trunk and the rustle of the few tough leaves left upon it. Hark! After a time, a whisper came from the wood itself, a sound like dry twigs snapping: "EAS."

"Eas?" thought the youth. "Bor-eas?" That sounded more like a name. But he must find the spring.

At last, on the morrow, he came to a cleft between tall rocks. There was the Hidden Spring. The water was clear as glass and strangely still, though the wind blew hard just overhead. He knelt down beside it. He looked into the water, but saw only the grey sky rushing past. He put his ear nigh the water's edge. The spring made only a little bubbling sound. But as he listened, the bubbles seemed to make a soft, hissing sound, over and over: "SSSSS."

Then the youth put the sounds together in his mind: Bor-eas. He stood up straight. He drew a great breath. He whispered into the wind, "Boreas."

At once, the wind tearing through the cleft seemed to pause. It did not fall silent, but it felt as if it were listening. A great voice, vast and sighing like the wind itself, but clear in his head, spoke. "Who names me?" it said.

The youth was greatly afraid, and his knees shook, but he stood fast. "It is Thomas," said he, "a boy from the village yonder on the mountain. Great Boreas, why is thy wrath so great against us? Thou hast flattened our barley. We shall go hungry."

The wind's voice sighed all around him, old beyond knowing. "'Wrath?'" it said. "Nay, little one. I have no wrath. I do but blow, for that is my nature. Still air brings sickness and blight upon the land. So I sweep it clean. Your barley fell before my breath? Then it grew too proud on weak stalks this year. Better flattened by wind than withered by the rot I sweep away. Strength grows in the storm, not in hiding from it."

The youth listened. He did not truly understand all, but he knew the wind was not wicked. "But, alas," said he quietly, "we will starve."

"Did thy stone walls stand?" asked the wind.
"Yea," answered the youth. "My father and I mend them well."
"And the deep-rooted herbs that grow on the high rocks?" asked the wind.
"Yea," said the youth, thinking of the tough plants the old wife gathered. "They beest strong."
"And the oldest trees, did they break?"
"Nay," he answered. "Only the young, weak ones snapped."

"Then learn from them," said Boreas. "Learn from the stone, learn from the herb, learn from the old tree. Bend when you must. Stand strong when you can. Root yourselves deep in the earth. Do not trust only the easy grain that grows fast but snaps quick. I am the wind. I blow. Your living is in your strength, not in my stillness."

Then the voice faded. The wind still blew upon the moor, but to Thomas, it sounded less like anger and more like a great breathing, going on and on. He knew now he could not stop the wind. No man could. But he had spoken with it, and he had learned somewhat of its ways.

Then the youth went back to the village. He came home tired, but his eyes were clear. He told the elders and all the folk what Boreas had said. Some grumbled, saying, "Words do not fill bellies." But the wiser folk listened hard.

They gathered what little grain was left. They went out and gathered the hardy mountain herbs. They mended their stone walls stronger than before. When planting time came again, they planted smaller fields of barley, and fields of tougher rye beside them. They tended their hardy sheep with care.

That winter, they were leaner, it is true. But they had learned a lesson. They had more wit. They did not curse the wind so much, but built strong against it. The village lived on.

And the youth Thomas was held in honour among them, not for commanding the wind, but for having the heart to go out and listen to its True Name. And perhaps they dwell there still, building strong walls and planting hardy grain upon the wind-swept mountain.



Martha and the Mud Sprites

There once lived a woman named Martha whose house was the cleanest in the village, whose doorstep was scrubbed white, and whose garden path had not a pebble out of place. She spent her days washing, scrubbing, sweeping, and tidying, and frowned upon dust as if it were a sin. She even scolded the birds for leaving feathers near her fence and swept the dew off the grass each morning.

Her neighbours thought her excessively tidy, but Martha believed cleanliness was the highest virtue. "Order is everything," she would declare. "Chaos belongs in the ditches."

Now, in the damp ditches and muddy puddles around the village lived the Mud Sprites, tiny creatures no bigger than a thumb, made of earth and water. They were mischievous but harmless beings who delighted in the squish of mud, the tumble of leaves, and the general untidiness of nature. They resented Martha's constant scrubbing and sweeping near their dwelling places.

One day, Martha decided the muddy ditch running behind her spotless garden was an eyesore. She took her shovel and pail and began digging it out, intending to line it neatly with smooth white stones she had collected. As she dug, she disturbed the Sprites' homes, scattering their tiny mud castles and leaf boats.

That evening, as Martha slept soundly in her immaculate bed, the Mud Sprites crept out. They were angry. They swarmed into her house through a crack under the door she had somehow missed sealing. Silently, they went to work.

They didn't break anything or steal anything. Instead, they brought chaos. They unravelled her knitting, leaving tangled yarn. They swapped the salt and sugar pots. They turned all the pictures on the wall slightly askew. They ruffled the perfectly smooth bedcovers. They left tiny, muddy footprints (which vanished as they dried) on her scrubbed floor. And, most vexing of all, they took every single pair of shoes in the house – her sturdy walking shoes, her Sunday shoes, her indoor slippers – and placed them neatly, but filled to the brim, with thick, wet mud from the ditch.

Martha awoke the next morning and saw the slight disarray. A frown creased her brow. She straightened the pictures, retidied the bedcovers, untangled the yarn. But when she went to put on her slippers and found them full of mud, she let out a shriek of fury. She checked her other shoes – all filled with mud!

Fuming, she cleaned them all meticulously, scrubbing until her knuckles were raw. That night, she blocked the crack under the door and went to bed, sure she had secured her home against intruders.

But the Sprites found another way in – down the chimney. Again, they created subtle chaos. This time, they hid her spectacles, swapped the labels on her herb jars, and tied tiny knots in all her sewing threads. And again, they filled every shoe with mud.

This went on for a week. Every night, Martha tidied and secured; every morning, she awoke to small acts of disorder and shoes full of mud. She grew frantic, exhausted by the constant cleaning and the unsettling feeling of being watched and subtly mocked. Her perfect house felt violated.

Finally, nearing tears of frustration, she sat down on her spotless stool, looked at her mud-filled shoes, and for the first time, wondered *why*. Why would anyone do this? It wasn't theft or vandalism, just... disorder. She thought of the ditch, how she had dug it out so fiercely. She thought of the birds she scolded, the dew she swept away.

A thought occurred to her. Perhaps... perhaps a little bit of untidiness wasn't so bad? Perhaps the world wasn't meant to be scrubbed quite so clean?

That evening, she did not scrub the mud from her shoes. Instead, she took them outside and placed them gently by the ditch she had disturbed. She went inside, leaving the door slightly ajar, and went to bed without checking every corner for dust.

The next morning, she awoke hesitantly. The house was... peaceful. Nothing was askew. Her spectacles were on the table, the herb jars correctly labelled, the sewing threads smooth. And when she looked outside, her shoes stood empty and clean beside the ditch. In the mud nearby, almost too small to see, were patterns that looked like tiny, joyful footprints dancing away.

Martha never became untidy, but she learned to live with a speck of dust here and there. She left the ditch alone, let the birds scatter feathers, and allowed the dew to dry naturally on the grass. And the Mud Sprites, their small measure of chaos respected, never troubled her again.


The Baron Who Ate the Wind

Baron Von Hess was a man whose appetite was as large as his estate, which is to say, enormous. He consumed roasted oxen, wheels of cheese, and barrels of wine, yet his hunger was never truly satisfied. His cooks despaired, for nothing seemed rich enough, rare enough, or plentiful enough. "More!" was the Baron's constant cry.

One day, a travelling mountebank came to the castle, promising wonders. The Baron, hoping for some new delicacy, summoned him. "What marvels can you offer my jaded palate?" he boomed.

The mountebank, a thin fellow with eyes that darted about, bowed low. "Noble Baron," he said slyly, "I possess a secret recipe, learned from the cloud-herders of the highest peaks. It allows one to capture and consume... the wind itself!"

The Baron stared. "Eat the wind? Preposterous!"

"Not preposterous, Your Excellency, but exquisite! Imagine! The freshness of the North Wind, the spice of the East Wind, the gentle balm of the South Wind, the wild freedom of the West Wind! A feast that fills without bloating, satisfies without surfeit!"

The Baron, intrigued by the sheer novelty and the promise of endless satisfaction, demanded the recipe. The mountebank named a high price – a bag of gold and the Baron's second-best horse. The greedy Baron paid immediately. The mountebank whispered the "secret":

"Atop the highest tower, when the chosen wind blows strong, hold open this Enchanted Bellows (he produced a small, oddly shimmering bellows) and draw the wind in thrice. Then, quickly seal the nozzle with this Stopper of Stillness (a plug of what looked like dark wax). When you desire to feast, unstopper the bellows slightly into a silver bowl. The captured wind will appear as a shimmering vapour. Inhale it deeply. Utter satisfaction!"

The mountebank pocketed his gold, took the horse, and departed hastily.

The Baron, eager for this new sensation, waited impatiently for the North Wind to blow fiercely. When it howled around the battlements, he climbed the highest tower, clutching the Enchanted Bellows and the Stopper of Stillness. He pointed the bellows northwards, worked the handles thrice, drawing in the biting wind, and quickly sealed it.

Back in his dining hall, he dismissed his cooks. He held the bellows over a silver bowl and carefully removed the Stopper of Stillness just a crack. A wisp of cold, shimmering vapour curled into the bowl. The Baron bent over and inhaled deeply.

An extraordinary sensation filled him! It was like swallowing snowflakes and ice, sharp, bracing, exhilarating! He felt utterly full, yet light as air. "Magnificent!" he roared.

Over the next days, he captured and consumed all four winds. The spicy East Wind tasted of distant deserts and unknown blossoms. The gentle South Wind felt like warm milk and sunshine. The wild West Wind tasted of salt spray and freedom. He needed no other food. His cooks were dismissed, his pantry grew dusty. The Baron spent his days inhaling vapours from his Enchanted Bellows, feeling wonderfully full and strangely light.

But the lightness grew. He found his feet barely touched the ground when he walked. A strong breeze could lift him several inches off the floor. He had to wear lead weights in his pockets to keep from floating away. His great belly, once vast, seemed unchanged, yet he felt... hollow, filled only with air and echoes. The satisfaction was real, but it pushed out everything else.

One afternoon, standing on his balcony, he uncorked the bellows for a taste of the West Wind. A sudden, powerful gust swept across the land. It caught the Baron, light as a bubble from his airy diet, and lifted him right off the balcony! The lead weights were not enough!

He floated upwards, clutching the useless bellows, crying out in alarm. Higher and higher he drifted, a comical, portly figure rising into the blue sky like a runaway balloon. His cries grew fainter. The villagers watched, mouths agape, as Baron Von Hess, who had desired to eat the wind, was carried away by it, never to be seen again. His castle stood empty, a testament to an appetite that consumed even substance itself, leaving only emptiness to be swept away. The mountebank, miles away, chuckled as he rode the Baron's horse, knowing the "Enchanted Bellows" was just an ordinary bellows, and the "Stopper" just wax – the Baron's own greed and imagination had done the rest.



The Girl Who Lost Her Laughter

Eliza was a girl whose laughter was like bells chiming, bright and clear. It bubbled up easily, at silly jokes, tumbling kittens, or the sheer joy of a sunny day. Her laughter was infectious, and people in her quiet village felt lighter just hearing it.

One day, walking through the woods that bordered the Whispering Fen, Eliza stumbled upon a small, moss-grown shrine hidden among the reeds. Before the shrine sat a Grieve-sprite, a creature woven of mist and sorrow, whose nature was to feed on bright emotions, leaving coldness behind. It looked up, its eyes like deep, still pools, and saw Eliza laughing at a clumsy frog leaping into the water.

The Grieve-sprite envied the bright sound. It held up a single, perfect, teardrop-shaped pearl. "Fair maiden," it whispered, its voice like rustling reeds, "your laughter is beautiful. Will you trade it? Give me your laughter, just for a day, and this pearl, which holds the echo of the sea's deepest calm, shall be yours."

Eliza, young and foolish, was entranced by the pearl's beauty. She imagined owning such a treasure. Trade her laughter? Just for a day? What harm could there be? "Agreed," she said.

The Grieve-sprite reached out a misty hand, and Eliza felt something flutter *out* of her, light as a butterfly. The sprite seemed to inhale it, sighing with satisfaction. It placed the cold pearl in Eliza's hand and faded back into the reeds.

Eliza felt... quiet. She looked at the frog, but felt no urge to laugh. She looked at the pearl, beautiful but cold. She walked home. Her family greeted her, her little brother told a funny story – Eliza smiled politely, but no bell-like chime came forth. The space inside her where laughter used to bubble felt empty and still.

The day passed, then another. Her laughter did not return. The Grieve-sprite had tricked her; the trade was not for a day, but forever. Eliza grew solemn. The village seemed quieter, greyer, without her bright laugh echoing through it. The pearl brought her no joy, only reminded her of her loss.

She realised she had to get her laughter back. She returned to the Whispering Fen, clutching the pearl. She found the mossy shrine, but the Grieve-sprite was not there. Despairing, she sank down beside the reeds. How could she find a creature of mist?

Just then, the clumsy frog she had laughed at before hopped near. It looked at her solemn face, then let out a comical 'Croak!' and puffed its throat out importantly. In her current state, Eliza found it not funny, just... pathetic. But then, another frog joined it, then another. They began to hop about absurdly, bumping into each other, falling over, croaking in a ridiculous chorus. It was such a silly, clumsy, earnest display that despite her emptiness, a tiny flicker of amusement sparked within Eliza. It wasn't laughter, but it was something.

As she felt that flicker, the air shimmered. The Grieve-sprite appeared, drawn by the faint spark of mirth. It looked surprised to see her.

"You," Eliza said, her voice flat but determined. "You tricked me. Give me back my laughter."

The Grieve-sprite clutched its misty chest, where her laughter now resided like a trapped sunbeam. "A bargain is a bargain," it whispered. "The pearl holds calm. Laughter holds chaos. You chose."

"I choose again," Eliza said. She held out the cold pearl. "Take back your calm. It is beautiful, but empty. I want my own foolish, noisy joy."

The Grieve-sprite hesitated, looking from the pearl to the faint light within its own form. It missed the sea's calm, but the warmth of the laughter was addictive.

"Perhaps another trade?" Eliza offered suddenly, thinking quickly. "Keep my laughter. But give me instead... its echo. Just the memory of how it felt."

The Grieve-sprite considered. To keep the laughter *and* take back the pearl? That was appealing. But to give back even an echo... it might diminish its prize. Yet, the pearl's cold calm called to its sorrowful nature. "The echo only?" it confirmed.

"The echo," Eliza agreed.

The trade was made. The Grieve-sprite took back the pearl, feeling the familiar cold peace settle over it. It reached out and seemed to pull a faint, shimmering thread from the laughter it held, offering it to Eliza. She felt something return – not the full, bubbling laughter, but a warm memory, a resonance in her soul.

The Grieve-sprite vanished. Eliza stood up. She looked at the clumsy frogs, still hopping foolishly. She didn't burst into peals of laughter as she once would have. But a genuine smile touched her lips, warm and deep. And a quiet chuckle escaped her – softer than before, wiser, perhaps, but undeniably hers. It was the echo, come to life.

She returned to the village. Her laughter never again had quite the same bell-like ring, but it was present – quiet chuckles, warm smiles, a gentle amusement that still brought lightness to those around her. She had learned that joy wasn't just a loud sound, but an inner warmth, and that even its echo was worth more than the coldest pearl.


The Basket Weaver and the Runaway House

Old Man Hemlock was the best basket weaver in the county, but he was also remarkably forgetful. He lived alone in a small, sturdy cottage he had built himself near the Whispering Reeds marsh. He often forgot where he put his tools, forgot to eat his dinner, and sometimes even forgot his own name for a moment or two. His saving grace was his routine: weave baskets, take them to market on Friday, buy food, come home.

One Thursday, preparing for market day, Hemlock realised he was completely out of supple willow withes. "Drat!" he muttered. "Must fetch more from the marsh." He grabbed his cutting knife and his favourite collecting basket – a particularly large, sturdy one he'd woven years ago – and headed out.

He spent the afternoon cutting withes by the marsh edge, losing track of time as usual. As dusk fell, he realised his large collecting basket was overflowing. "Too much to carry easily," he sighed. "And market is tomorrow... Hmm."

A peculiar thought struck his forgetful mind. "This basket is almost as big as my house," he mused aloud (though it wasn't really). "And my house is sturdy... perhaps..."

Instead of making two trips, Hemlock had a truly muddled idea. He emptied the withes out of the large basket. Then, using skills honed over decades, he quickly wove some of the fresh, supple withes *around* his small stone and timber cottage, securing them cleverly to the foundation stones and roof beams he himself had laid. He then somehow attached these woven bindings to the giant collecting basket which lay beside the house. His plan, fuzzy as it was, was to somehow use the basket to help drag or carry the *entire house* closer to the market road, saving himself a trip tomorrow.

It made no logical sense, but Hemlock was tired and forgetful. He tugged experimentally on the giant basket's handle. The woven withes creaked, the house shifted slightly with a groan. "Aha!" thought Hemlock, misinterpreting the groan as success. He gave another, mightier heave.

With a sound like tearing roots and snapping twine, the supple withes, combined with the magic inherent in the marsh reeds they grew near, did something unexpected. They didn't just pull the house; they *uprooted* it. The entire small cottage lifted slightly, hovering inches above the ground, tethered precariously to the giant basket like a stubborn mule to a flimsy rope.

Hemlock stared, bewildered. Before he could react, a gust of wind caught the hovering cottage. It began to drift, slowly at first, then faster, bumping erratically across the landscape, dragging the giant basket behind it.

"Stop! House, stop!" Hemlock cried, running after it, knife still in hand.

But the house paid no heed. It bumped over fields, snagged on trees (breaking branches), floated awkwardly across shallow streams, and headed determinedly away from the market town. Hemlock chased it, shouting, growing increasingly desperate as his home ran away from him.

He chased it all night. By dawn, the runaway house had bumped its way into a narrow, rocky gorge miles from home, where it finally wedged itself firmly between two sheer cliffs. It settled to the ground with a final, exhausted sigh of timbers.

Hemlock caught up, panting, knife still clutched in his hand. His house was intact, but hopelessly stuck. He couldn't weave it free. He couldn't pull it out. He sat down on a rock, utterly defeated. His forgetfulness and peculiar idea had cost him his home's location.

Just then, a troop of the King's soldiers marched into the gorge, escorting a wagon laden with stone for repairing a distant border fort. They stopped, amazed, at the sight of a cottage wedged between the cliffs. The Captain stared at Hemlock, sitting forlornly with a knife.

"You there!" the Captain barked. "Is this your dwelling? How in the King's name did it get here?"

Hemlock, forgetting his predicament for a moment, just looked confused. "Is it Thursday?" he asked.

The Captain, suspecting idiocy or witchcraft, ordered his men to investigate. They saw the woven withes, the giant basket nearby. "It seems," a sergeant reported, scratching his head, "that the old man somehow... dragged his house here with a basket?"

The Captain looked at the sturdy cottage, then at the narrow gorge blocking their path. An idea struck *him*. "Men!" he commanded. "This house blocks the King's vital supply route! We must dislodge it! Use the levers and ropes!"

The soldiers, grumbling but obedient, set to work. Using their strong ropes, heavy crowbars, and sheer numbers, they managed, after much effort, to pry the cottage free from the gorge. They pushed and pulled it clear of the path.

"There," said the Captain, satisfied. "Now, old man, see that you keep your house where it belongs!" The soldiers marched off with their wagon of stone.

Hemlock stared at his freed house, then back down the path towards home, then at the giant basket. He sighed. He carefully cut the withes connecting the house to the basket. He couldn't possibly drag it back. He abandoned the giant basket, gathered the cut withes he still needed, and trudged wearily back towards the spot where his house *should* be, hoping he remembered the way. He eventually found the empty patch of ground and resigned himself to living in the open until he could somehow earn enough for timbers to build anew, or perhaps find a way to move the house back bit by bit over many months. His forgetfulness had led him on a strange chase indeed.


The Stone Prince

There was a kingdom where the king and queen dearly wished for a child. They consulted physicians and wise women, but years passed, and the queen remained childless. One day, walking sadly in the royal gardens, the queen rested her hand upon a smooth, grey garden statue of a young boy playing pipes, worn by time and weather. "Oh, stone child," she sighed aloud, "if only you were real, I would love you as my own son, even if you kept your stony heart."

Her words, spoken with deep longing beside the ancient statue, held an unwitting magic. That night, the queen dreamed the statue stepped down from its pedestal. When she awoke, the statue was indeed gone from the garden. And in the royal nursery, sleeping peacefully in the cradle, lay a baby boy. He was beautiful, but his skin had a faint grey, smooth coolness, like polished stone, and though he breathed and moved, he never cried, never smiled, never showed any flicker of emotion. His heart, as the queen had wished, was like stone.

They named him Florian. He grew into a handsome young prince, strong and skilled in all princely arts – riding, swordsmanship, languages. He obeyed every command perfectly, learned every lesson instantly, but his face remained a mask, his eyes distant. He felt no joy, no sorrow, no anger, no love. He was dutiful, but cold. The king and queen loved him dearly, but grieved for the son whose heart remained stone.

Word of the Stone Prince spread. Neighbouring kingdoms whispered about the emotionless heir. When Florian came of age, no princess wished to marry him, fearing a life beside living marble.

One day, a travelling storyteller came to the court. She told tales of faraway lands, enchantments, and quests. Afterwards, Florian approached her, his voice calm and even as always. "Storyteller," he asked, "in your tales, are there ever cures for enchantments of the heart?"

The storyteller looked closely at the handsome, cold prince. "There are legends, Your Highness," she said softly. "They speak of the Sunken City beneath the Silent Lake, where the Tear-stone Mirror lies hidden. It is said this mirror does not reflect one's face, but one's truest, deepest feelings. But the City is guarded, and the Lake gives up its secrets grudgingly."

For the first time, a flicker of something – perhaps curiosity, perhaps a logical assessment of a potential solution – crossed Florian's face. He resolved to seek this Mirror. He asked no one's permission, simply equipped himself plainly, left a note of his intention, and departed for the Silent Lake, which lay many leagues distant through wild country.

He journeyed for weeks, facing hardships with stoic indifference. Bandits attacked; he disarmed them with cool efficiency, feeling no fear or anger. He went hungry; it was merely a state to be endured. He saw beauty in sunsets and landscapes; he noted it as data, feeling no awe.

At last, he reached the Silent Lake, a vast, unnaturally still body of water surrounded by dark cliffs. There was no boat. Following the legend the storyteller hinted at, Florian knew he must enter the water willingly. He walked into the cold lake without hesitation. The water closed over his head, yet he found he could breathe as if in air.

Beneath the surface, the water was clear, revealing the ghostly outlines of the Sunken City – towers and archways covered in silt and weed. Strange, silent fish drifted through ruined doorways. As he descended towards the largest central dome, ghostly figures formed from the lake water – the Water Guardians. They barred his path, their forms shifting, their silent challenge radiating despair and loss – emotions Florian could not feel.

He tried to push past them, but they reformed instantly. He drew his sword, but it passed through them harmlessly. They did not attack, merely blocked, their silent sorrow an impassable barrier to anyone who could feel it. But Florian felt nothing. Their despair washed over him like water itself, having no effect on his stone heart. He simply walked *through* them. Their forms swirled and dissipated around him, unable to gain purchase on his emotionless state.

He reached the central dome and entered. Inside, resting on a dais, was a large, circular mirror framed in coral and pearl. Its surface was not reflective silver, but swirled with milky, shifting colours. The Tear-stone Mirror.

Florian stood before it. He expected to see… nothing. He felt nothing, so surely the Mirror would remain blank? He looked into its depths.

At first, nothing happened. Then, slowly, shapes began to form in the milky colours. He saw not his own feelings, but the feelings *directed at him*. He saw his mother's desperate longing when she spoke to the statue. He saw his father's quiet grief at his coldness. He saw the storyteller's pity. He saw the fear in the eyes of the princesses who refused him. He saw the bandits' fleeting anger. He saw the villagers' distant awe and slight unease. All the emotions he could not feel himself were reflected back at him, focused upon him by the Mirror.

It was overwhelming. A lifetime of unfelt love, sorrow, fear, and hope crashed into his awareness. His stone heart, unable to process the sudden flood, cracked. A physical, audible *crack* echoed in the silent dome. Pain, sharp and real, lanced through him – the first true feeling he had ever known. It was quickly followed by sorrow for the grief he caused, love for the parents who endured, fear of the emptiness within him, hope that this crack meant change.

Tears – real, hot tears – streamed down his face, mingling with the water of the lake. As his first tear struck the surface of the Mirror, it shimmered violently. The reflected images vanished, replaced by his own face, no longer a cold mask, but alive with confusion, pain, and burgeoning hope. His skin lost its stony coolness, gaining warmth and colour.

The Mirror had shown him not his own feelings, but the feelings of others *about* him, and that reflection had been enough to break the stone enchantment born of his mother's wish.

He left the Sunken City, the Water Guardians no longer hindering him (perhaps sensing his newfound feeling), and emerged from the Silent Lake, gasping for air like a newborn. He returned to his kingdom, no longer the Stone Prince, but simply Florian, a young man capable of joy, sorrow, and love, ready at last to truly live.

The Girl Who Carried the Empty Bucket

There was once a village beside a dry river. Water was scarce, and the people fetched it from a deep well far up the stony hill. A certain poor woman had a daughter named Lina. Lina was not clever, nor was she strong, but she was good-hearted and always did as she was bid.

One morning, her mother said, "Lina, the water jar is empty. Go now to the well on the hill and bring water, for I must make the bread."

So Lina took the heavy clay jar and went forth. The path was steep, and the sun was hot. She walked slowly. Halfway up the hill, she saw an old man sitting by the path. He looked very thirsty. His face was grey, and his lips were cracked.

"Child," he croaked, his voice like dry leaves, "have you any water? Just a drop for an old man."

Lina looked at her empty jar. "I have naught, good father," she said sadly. "I go now to fetch water from the well."

The old man sighed. "Ah, the well is far, and my legs are weak. But perhaps," he said, looking sharply at her empty jar, "perhaps you carry something else I need."

Lina was puzzled. "But the jar is empty," she replied.

"Is it truly empty?" asked the man. "Or does it carry the promise of water?"

Lina did not understand his words, but she felt pity for him. She thought, "He is old and thirsty. Even if I have no water, I can give him comfort." So she stopped and sat beside him. She spoke kindly to him and told him about her village and her mother. She wiped the dust from his brow with the edge of her apron. She offered him the shady spot where she had been standing. She did this not for gain, but because her heart was good.

After a time, the old man stood up. He looked less grey. "You have given me something better than water, child," he said. "You gave kindness when you had naught else to give. Now, look inside your jar."

Lina peered into the jar. It was filled to the brim with cool, clear water. She gasped.

"Go now," said the old man. "And remember, an empty hand given with kindness is sometimes fuller than a fist full of gold."

Then the old man vanished. Lina did not know where he went. She lifted the jar, which now felt light as a feather, and hurried back down the hill. Her mother was amazed to see her return so soon with the jar full. From that day on, whenever Lina went to fetch water, the jar never felt heavy, and there was always enough for whoever asked kindly along the way.


The Stone of Sighs

Once upon a time, there lay a stone beside a dusty road. It was not large, nor was it handsome, being grey and smooth like a thousand others. Yet this stone was not like the others, for it held a secret: it could hear the wishes of men, but it had no mind to grant them. It only wished to be left alone, and when someone wished upon it, the stone would sigh, a sound so faint only the wind might notice, and twist the wish awry.

One day, a farmer came by, driving his lean cow. His cart had lost a wheel, and he sat weary on the ground. He saw the stone and thought, "Perhaps this stone has some luck in it." He picked it up, felt its smoothness, and sighed himself. "Ah, stone," said he, "I wish I had a strong new wheel for my cart, so I might reach the market ere nightfall."

The stone sighed, unheard. Then, down the road came a great clatter. A rich merchant's carriage, driving too fast, struck a rut, and snap! Its fine red wheel broke clean off and rolled right to the farmer's feet. "There is your wheel!" cried the merchant angrily. "But it is mine, and broken besides! You there, help me!" The farmer spent the next hour helping the fuming merchant, and never reached the market at all that day. He cast the stone away in vexation.

So the stone lay in the grass. Soon a young maiden walked by, weeping softly. Her gown was torn, and her face sad. "My father has lost all his coin," she whispered to the stone, picking it up. "I wish I had but one shining gold piece, enough to buy bread for the week."

The stone sighed. At that moment, a hawk flew overhead, and from its talons dropped something bright. It landed near the maiden's feet – a lady's earring, all of gold and pearl. "Oh, fortune!" cried the maiden. But as she picked it up, the lady herself came running from a nearby path. "My earring! Thief!" she shrieked, though the maiden was innocent. The lady called her servants, and the poor maiden was dragged away to explain herself to the bailiff, finding more trouble than treasure. She dropped the stone in her fright.

Then came a soldier, limping from the wars. He had naught but his worn coat and an empty belly. He saw the stone and clutched it hard. "Stone," he muttered, "I wish I had a good horse beneath me, to carry me home to my village."

The stone sighed its weary sigh. Just then, around the bend came a fine black horse, riderless, its saddlebags bulging. The soldier's eyes lit up. But behind the horse ran three grim-faced men with cudgels. "Stop him! He has stolen the master's horse!" they yelled, seeing the soldier near it. The soldier, knowing he could not explain, had to flee into the woods, running farther from his village than before. He cursed the stone and threw it deep among the trees.

There the stone lay for many a year, covered by leaves and moss. No one came by to wish upon it. The wind blew, the rain fell, and the stone was content. It heard no wishes, and it sighed no more. It wanted only peace, and at last, in the quiet dark of the woods, it had found it. And perhaps it lies there still, glad to be forgotten.




The Weaver Who Became a Loom

There once lived a weaver in a small cottage by the edge of a town. He was known for his skill, and his cloth was sought by many, though he earned but a modest living. He worked from sunup till sundown at his great wooden loom, the shuttle flying back and forth like a swift bird.

One evening, as dusk fell, an old woman with eyes like chips of flint came to his door. She was bent and cloaked, and she carried a small, curiously carved spindle. "Weaver," she rasped, "you slighted my sister in the market square today. You laughed when she stumbled and dropped her wares. For your mockery, you shall learn humility."

The weaver protested he remembered no such thing, but the old woman raised the spindle. "By the warp and the weft," she chanted, "by the thread and the thrum! When the moon is hidden dark, your form shall be undone! You shall know the wood's cold heart, the tension of the spun!"

Then she was gone. The weaver, troubled, barred his door and went to bed. But when the moon was new and the night blackest, he awoke not in his bed, but standing rigid in the corner where his loom stood. He *was* the loom. He felt the grain of his own wooden frame, the tightness of the warp threads stretched upon him, the cold metal of the heddles. He could not move, could not speak, only stand and wait. When dawn came, he found himself back in his bed, trembling, the loom standing silent as ever.

This happened each dark moon. He tried staying awake, locking himself out, but always he awoke as the loom. His work suffered, for he feared the cycle. Then came a month when, as the loom, he felt a hand touch his frame. It was his neighbour, a poor widow, come early to borrow a spool of thread. Finding the door unlocked, she had crept in. As she touched the loom, seeking the thread basket nearby, the weaver felt a strange connection. He could suddenly impress a thought into her mind: *Help me.*

The widow started, looking around the empty room. She felt the thought again, stronger, seeming to come from the loom itself. Being a simple woman, she did not question the magic, but asked aloud, "Loom, how can I help you?"

The weaver-loom impressed another thought: *Find the spindle woman. Offer service.*

The widow, though afraid, agreed. She searched the town and the paths around, asking for an old woman with flint eyes and a carved spindle. At last, she found her cottage, deep in the woods. The widow knocked timidly.

"What do you want?" screeched the spindle woman.

"I come on behalf of the weaver," said the widow. "He offers his service to undo the curse."

The old woman cackled. "Service, is it? Very well. Let him, in his loom-form, weave me a cloth of moonlight and shadow, soft as moss but strong as iron. Let it be done ere the next dark moon returns."

The widow brought the message back. The weaver despaired. How could he weave as a loom? But the widow said, "Perhaps you guide, and I work?"

So, on the next dark moon, the widow came to the cottage. The weaver stood rigid, as the loom. But this time, as the widow sat before him, he found he could guide her hands. He impressed thoughts: *This thread. Pull tighter. Pass the shuttle now. Shift the heddle.* Slowly, painstakingly, through the long nights leading up to the dark moon, they worked whenever the weaver was transformed. The widow brought threads spun from wool dyed darkest black, and others bleached white as bone. Under the weaver-loom's mental guidance, she wove a cloth of strange beauty, patterned like dappled moonlight on the forest floor. It felt soft, yet resisted tearing.

On the day before the dark moon, the widow took the cloth to the spindle woman. The old woman examined it closely, rubbing it, pulling it. "It is done," she grudgingly admitted. She handed the widow the carved spindle. "Break this upon his threshold at moonrise. But tell the weaver: mockery finds strange echoes."

The widow hurried back. As the moon hid its face and the weaver felt the change begin, the widow stood at his cottage door and snapped the spindle across the threshold stone. There was a crack like breaking ice, and the weaver felt himself stumble forward, fully human again, the transformation halted forever.

He thanked the widow with tears in his eyes, and shared his earnings with her from that day forward. He never again laughed at another's misfortune, remembering the cold heart of the wood and the tension of the threads. The loom remained in the corner, but now it seemed just a tool once more, silent and waiting.




The Baker's Truthful Loaves

There was a baker who lived in a town beside a swift-flowing river. He was an honest man, but poor, for the Guild Master in the town was greedy and demanded a heavy fee each year. This Guild Master was also the town's chief merchant, fat and proud, and it was whispered he used false weights at his scales.

One day, the baker could not pay the fee. The Guild Master laughed cruelly. "Then yield your shop to me, baker, or find the gold by tomorrow noon!"

The baker went home heavy of heart. He had naught but flour for one last batch of bread. As he sat despairing, a little grey bird flew in his window, which he had never seen before. It hopped onto his table and chirped, looking at his flour sack.

"Little bird," sighed the baker, "I have nothing for you, nor soon for myself."

The bird chirped again, then pecked three times at an old, dusty recipe book the baker's grandmother had left him, a book he had never opened. Then it flew away. Curious, the baker opened the book. On the first page, in faded ink, was a recipe for "Truth-Teller's Bread." It looked simple enough, but at the bottom were strange words: *'Who eats this loaf, whate’er they hide, / Their secret thoughts will speak inside. / One slice tells truth for one short hour, / Use wisely this revealing power.'*

The baker, having nothing to lose, decided to try it. He mixed the dough exactly as written, using his last flour. The bread rose beautifully and baked to a golden brown. It smelled like any other loaf. He wrapped one loaf carefully and took it, warm from the oven, to the Guild Master's house just before noon.

"Master Merchant," said the baker humbly, "I have no gold. But I bring you the finest loaf I have ever baked, as a sign of respect."

The Guild Master sneered but took the bread, for he was fond of fresh loaves. "This changes nothing, baker. The shop is mine at noon." He broke off a piece and began to eat it as the baker turned sadly away.

As the baker walked through the town square, he heard a commotion from the Guild Master's house. The Guild Master stood upon his balcony, shouting. "Yes, my scales are weighted!" he bellowed, his face red. "I cheat you all! That shipment of wool was full of moths! And I paid the watchman to look away when my nephew stole the widow's pig!" People gathered, gasping and pointing. The Guild Master seemed unable to stop himself, revealing one dishonest deed after another. This continued for nigh on an hour, until the effect wore off, leaving him spluttering and aghast in front of the furious townsfolk.

Seeing his chance, the baker hurried back to his shop and baked another Truth-Teller's Loaf. He went to the Town Hall where the Mayor and councilmen were discussing the Guild Master's sudden confession. The baker offered the fresh loaf to them, saying, "Good sirs, perhaps some refreshment while you deliberate?"

The Mayor, a portly man fond of his comfort, took a large slice. Soon he began to speak. "Indeed, the Guild Master is a rogue," he declared, "but profitable! I took a share of his false fees, true enough! And that bridge contract went to my cousin, though his work is shoddy!" One by one, the councilmen who tasted the bread confessed their own petty dishonesties and secret dealings.

The townspeople, listening at the door, grew angrier still. They ran the disgraced Mayor and councilmen out of town, along with the ruined Guild Master. They then chose the baker, known for his honesty (and now, his strangely effective bread), to oversee the Guild fairly.

The baker prospered, but he used the Truth-Teller's Bread sparingly, remembering its power. He kept the recipe book hidden, knowing that truth, like bread, is best served rightly and not used for mischief. He paid fair prices for his flour and sold honest loaves, and the town beside the river thrived once more.



The Girl Who Mended the Weather Vane

On a windswept hill overlooking the sea, there stood a cluster of poor fishermen's cottages. In one lived a little girl with nimble fingers and a kind heart. Her father was often away on his boat, leaving her to tend their small garden and keep watch over the waves.

Atop the oldest cottage, though not her own, perched a rusty iron weather vane shaped like a cockerel. It had been stuck fast for years, always pointing east, no matter how the wind blew. The old fisherman who lived there was too frail to climb and fix it, and the other villagers had no time for such things.

One day, a fierce storm blew in from the sea. The wind howled, and the waves crashed against the rocks. The little girl worried for her father. As she watched the storm from her window, she saw the rusty weather vane straining against the wind. With a loud groan, it tore partly loose from its mounting, hanging precariously by a single strap.

When the storm passed and the sun returned, the girl saw the damaged weather vane hanging sadly. "Poor cockerel," she thought. "You look hurt." Though it was not her task, she felt pity for it. She found her father's small hammer and a handful of sturdy nails. She asked the old fisherman if she might try to fix his vane, and he, surprised, nodded his assent.

Carefully, the girl climbed onto the low roof. The iron cockerel was heavier than it looked. She pushed it back into place, her small fingers struggling with the bent metal strap. Patiently, she hammered the old nails tight and added two new ones for strength. She even used a rag to wipe away some of the thickest rust. At last, the cockerel stood upright again. With a gentle nudge, she set it spinning. It turned smoothly in the sea breeze, facing west.

As she climbed down, she heard a faint, creaky whisper, seemingly from the air itself. *"Thank you, little one. A kindness given is a kindness earned."*

The girl looked around, but saw no one. She thought it must be the wind sighing through the eaves.

But the next morning, as she went to the shore, the creaky whisper came again. *"South wind rising. Tell the boats to wait."* She looked up. The iron cockerel on the roof was pointing south, though the morning breeze still felt gentle. She trusted the strange voice. She ran along the shore, calling to the fishermen preparing their boats, "Wait! A south wind is coming!"

Some laughed, but the older fishermen, knowing the sea's tricks, paused. And indeed, within the hour, a sudden squall blew up from the south, tossing the waves mightily. The boats that had stayed ashore were safe. Those few who had ignored the warning were caught out and struggled back to harbour with torn nets and frightened hearts.

From then on, the weather vane often whispered warnings to the girl. *"Fog rolling in,"* it would creak, and she would tell the fishermen. *"Fair winds for three days,"* it sighed, and the boats sailed out confidently. *"Distant sail, flying the black flag,"* it warned once, allowing the villagers to hide their few valuables before pirates passed harmlessly offshore.

The little girl never knew why the weather vane spoke only to her, or how. She simply listened, and helped her village. Her kindness to the rusty cockerel had brought safety to them all. The cockerel, for its part, turned faithfully in the wind, keeping watch over the sea, its creaky whispers a secret shared only with the girl with the nimble fingers and the kind heart.




The Spoon, the Bowl, and the Crumb on a Journey

In a kitchen cupboard, there lived a Wooden Spoon, an Earthenware Bowl, and a little Dry Crumb of bread. They sat together day after day. The Spoon leaned against the Bowl, and the Crumb nestled inside the Bowl.

One day, the Bowl sighed (which sounded like a faint *clink*). "Oh, Spoon," it said, "I am weary of this dark cupboard. I wish to see the Wide World."

"Indeed," creaked the Spoon. "My handle aches for adventure. Let us go!"

"And I," squeaked the tiny Crumb from the bottom of the Bowl, "I wish to see where I came from! Perhaps we shall find the Great Loaf!"

So they decided to set out. But how? The Bowl could not walk, the Spoon could only lie flat, and the Crumb was too small to travel alone.

"Wait," clinked the Bowl. "Spoon, if you lie down, I can roll onto your flat part. Crumb, you stay inside me. Then, if we tilt just so..."

It was a clumsy plan. The Spoon lay down. The Bowl rolled awkwardly onto the Spoon's handle. The Crumb bounced about inside. By shifting and wobbling, they managed to tip themselves off the edge of the cupboard shelf. Clatter! Bump! They landed on the kitchen floor.

"Huzzah!" creaked the Spoon, though slightly splintered. "We are free!"

They needed to cross the vast stone floor to reach the Back Door, which they could see slightly ajar, showing a glimpse of the Green Garden.

"How shall we cross?" clinked the Bowl nervously. "The floor is so wide."

"I have an idea," squeaked the Crumb. "Wait here." And the little Crumb rolled away towards the Hearth, where some stray bits of kindling lay. It pushed with all its might against a long, thin wood shaving. Slowly, the shaving moved. The Crumb pushed it back towards the others. "Spoon," it squeaked, "lie flat again. Bowl, roll onto the Spoon. I shall push the shaving under you like a roller!"

It was slow work. The Crumb pushed the shaving, the Spoon wobbled with the Bowl on top, and inch by inch, they moved across the floor. Suddenly, a shadow fell over them. It was the House Cat, sleek and black, with eyes like green glass.

"Meeow?" it questioned, batting curiously at the Spoon's end.

"Quick!" clinked the Bowl in terror. "Tip us!"

They wobbled violently. The Bowl rolled off the Spoon, landing upside down, trapping the Crumb safely beneath it. The Spoon lay still, pretending to be mere wood. The Cat sniffed the upturned Bowl, batted the Spoon again, lost interest, and sauntered away.

"Phew," creaked the Spoon when the danger was past. The Bowl righted itself. The Crumb emerged, trembling. "That was close," it squeaked.

They continued their slow journey, pushed by the Crumb on the shaving-roller. At last, they reached the Back Door. It was open just enough for them to squeeze through.

Outside, the Green Garden seemed enormous. Giant blades of grass towered over them. A monstrous Worm wriggled past. A busy Ant carrying a seed bumped into the Bowl. "Beg pardon," buzzed the Ant, and hurried on.

"The Wide World is very... wide," clinked the Bowl uncertainly.

"And full of strange folk," creaked the Spoon.

"But where is the Great Loaf?" squeaked the Crumb, looking about the vast greenness.

Just then, a small brown Sparrow hopped down from a bush. It eyed the little Crumb keenly. Before the Spoon or Bowl could react, the Sparrow darted forward, plucked up the Dry Crumb in its beak, and flew away.

"Crumb!" clinked the Bowl in dismay.

"Alas!" creaked the Spoon sadly.

They sat there, the Wooden Spoon and the Earthenware Bowl, alone in the big garden. The adventure felt less grand now. The Wide World was perhaps too wide, and too full of hungry birds.

"Spoon," sighed the Bowl after a long silence. "Perhaps the cupboard was not so bad after all."

"Indeed," creaked the Spoon. "It was quiet. And safe."

They did not know how to get back. So they just stayed there in the garden. Perhaps the gardener found them later and took them back inside. Or perhaps they are still out there, the Spoon leaning against the Bowl, remembering their little Dry Crumb and the day they journeyed into the Wide World.



The Hat That Rhymed

There was once a pedlar who travelled the roads with trinkets and trifles. He was a cheerful soul, but sometimes lonely. One rainy evening, seeking shelter, he stumbled upon a tiny, moss-covered hut he had never seen before, tucked away beneath an old oak. Inside sat a little old woman, no bigger than a mushroom, weaving rushes by the firelight.

"Good evening, Mother," said the pedlar, shaking the rain from his coat. "Might I rest by your fire till the storm passes?"

The little woman looked up, her eyes like bright beads. "Aye, pedlar, sit you down. But travellers pay for warmth with a story or a song."

The pedlar had few stories and a poor voice for singing. He looked through his pack. "I have no song," he said, "but perhaps a trade? A bright ribbon? A tin whistle?"

The little woman waved them away. "Nay. But I see you have a plain brown hat. Give me the hat, and you may stay the night."

The pedlar hesitated, for it was his only hat against sun and rain. But the fire was warm, and the hut dry. "Very well," he said, handing it over.

The little woman took the hat. She pulled three strands of silvery thread from her basket – one like moonlight, one like starlight, one like sunlight. With quick fingers, she wove them into the hatband, humming a strange tune. She handed it back. "Wear this now, pedlar man," she chuckled. "It has a touch of magic in its span."

The pedlar thanked her and put the hat on. It felt no different. He spent a warm night by the fire and left in the morning, the rain having stopped. As he walked down the path, a farmer passed him on a donkey. "Good day to you, friend!" called the farmer.

The pedlar opened his mouth to reply "Good day," but instead out came: "Good day, the sky is **grey**, I hope you go the proper **way**!"

The farmer stared. The pedlar clapped a hand to his mouth, bewildered. He tried to say, "A fine morning," but instead said: "A fine **day**, come what **may**!"

He realized with horror that the hat was making him speak only in rhymes! He tried to take it off, but it seemed stuck fast to his head. He walked on, dreading meeting anyone else. He needed to sell his wares in the next village.

He reached the village market. A woman stopped by his stall. "How much for this lace?" she asked.

The pedlar tried to say "Three pennies," but out popped: "For lace so **white**, the price is **right**, three pennies makes it yours **tonight**!"

The woman laughed. "Tonight? It's barely noon! But your rhymes are merry. I'll take it!" She paid him, still chuckling.

A man asked the price of a knife. The pedlar groaned inwardly, then declared: "This knife so **keen**, the best I've **seen**, will cost you sir, just **fifteen**!" (He meant five).

"Fifteen!" cried the man. "Too much!" But the pedlar's rhyming style drew a small crowd. People were amused. They asked him questions just to hear his rhyming answers.
"What news from the road, pedlar?"
"The road is **long**, the world goes **wrong**, but still I sing my silly **song**!"
"Is your donkey well?" (He had no donkey).
"My donkey **bright**, sleeps well at **night**, he's never caused me any **fright**!"

He sold more trinkets that day than he had all week, though his prices were often confused by the rhymes. People bought things just for the fun of hearing him speak. By evening, his pack was much lighter, and his purse heavier, but his head ached from constant rhyming.

He left the village, desperate to remove the hat. He pulled, he tugged, but it would not budge. He sat by the roadside in despair. "Oh, hat, you bring me **trouble**, my poor words you **double**!" he lamented.

Just then, the little old woman from the hut appeared beside him, as if from nowhere. "Not trouble, pedlar," she said, her eyes twinkling. "Just a different tune. Did you sell your wares?"

"Aye," sighed the pedlar, "but this rhyming **flows**, wherever my poor head **goes**!"

"Sometimes," said the little woman, "a change of tune is what the world needs. But perhaps you've rhymed enough for one day." She tapped the hat three times. It instantly felt loose. The pedlar snatched it off his head with relief.

"Keep the hat," she said. "But wear it only when you wish for rhymes. Now, give me a smile for my trouble."

The pedlar, free from the rhymes, gave her a wide, grateful smile. The little woman chuckled again and vanished like mist. The pedlar looked at the hat, then tucked it carefully into his pack. He walked on towards the setting sun, speaking plain words once more, but feeling perhaps the world was a little more whimsical than he had thought.




The Frog Choir That Croaked

By the side of a marshy pond, there lived a great company of frogs. They spent their days catching flies, swimming about, and croaking to each other in their froggy way.

One day, a fat old bullfrog named Bullywort, who fancied himself very important, had an idea. He had heard the humans in the nearby village singing in their church. It sounded grand and loud.

"My brothers!" croaked Bullywort, puffing out his green throat. "We frogs have fine voices! Why should we not make a Grand Choir, like the humans? We shall practice and make music that will echo through the marsh!"

The other frogs thought this sounded very fine indeed. They gathered around eagerly.

"Now," commanded Bullywort, "we must have order! We need high voices and low voices. All you little green frogs, you shall be the High Croaks. You bigger brown frogs, you are the Middle Croaks. And we largest bullfrogs, naturally, are the Deep Croaks!"

This seemed sensible enough. They arranged themselves on the muddy bank: little frogs in front, brown frogs behind them, and the big bullfrogs at the back.

"First," said Bullywort, "we shall practice scales! High Croaks, sing 'Reep!'"
A chorus of tiny, high-pitched "Reep! Reep! Reep!" went up.
"Good! Middle Croaks, sing 'Cro-oak!'"
A wave of medium "Cro-oak! Cro-oak!" followed.
"Excellent! Deep Croaks, sing 'Bur-rum!'"
A deep, resonant "Bur-rum! Bur-rum!" shook the reeds.

"Splendid!" puffed Bullywort. "Now, all together! We shall sing a Song of the Pond!" He raised his webbed foot like a conductor. "Ready? Sing!"

He expected a mighty chorus. Instead, what came out was chaos. The High Croaks went "Reep-reep-reep!" very fast. The Middle Croaks began "Cro-oak!" but got distracted by a dragonfly and trailed off. The Deep Croaks let out a slow, booming "BUR-RUM!" that completely drowned out the others. Then one frog saw a tasty midge and leaped for it with a loud *plop*. Another tripped over a root and fell squawking into the water. Soon, all the frogs were croaking different things at different times, or chasing insects, or bumping into each other. It was not a choir; it was a cacophony.

Bullywort hopped up and down, croaking furiously. "Silence! Order! Follow my lead!"

He tried again. "A simple tune! 'The Sun is Warm'! High Croaks: Reep-reep warm! Middle Croaks: Cro-oak sun! Deep Croaks: Bur-rum is warm!"

He waved his foot. "Reep-reep warm! Cro-oak sun! Bur-rum is warm!" came the ragged attempt. It sounded less like music and more like someone dropping logs into mud.

Just then, a Heron, long-legged and sharp-beaked, landed silently at the edge of the pond, attracted by the noise. Its eyes fixed on the disorganized frogs.

One little High Croak spotted the danger. "Reep! (Heron!)" it shrieked, and dove for the water.

Instantly, the Grand Choir dissolved. "Cro-oak! (Danger!)" went the Middle Croaks, scattering. "Bur-rum! (Flee!)" boomed the Deep Croaks, leaping into the deepest part of the pond with mighty splashes.

Bullywort was the last to react, still trying to conduct. The Heron's beak darted down, but Bullywort, with a terrified "BUR-RUMPH!", jumped just in time, landing deep in the mud.

When the danger had passed, the frogs slowly poked their heads above the water. They looked at each other. They looked at Bullywort, covered in mud. No one spoke of the Grand Choir again. They went back to catching flies, swimming about, and croaking to each other in their own froggy way, which, after all, seemed to suit them much better.

The Princess Who Collected Dust

In a kingdom renowned for its gleaming castles and polished floors, there lived a Princess named Amalia. Unlike other princesses who collected jewels or suitors, Amalia collected dust.

Not great clumps of grime, mind you, but the fine, shimmering dust that settled on forgotten windowsills or danced in sunbeams. She kept it in little crystal jars, labelled meticulously: "Sunbeam Dust - East Tower," "Velvet Curtain Dust - Ballroom," "Forgotten Book Dust - Library." Her father the King, and her mother the Queen, thought it most peculiar, but Amalia was gentle and caused no trouble, so they let her be.

One day, a neighbouring King, very rich and powerful, but whose kingdom was notoriously dull and grey, sent an envoy. "My master, King Borin, wishes to wed the Princess Amalia," announced the envoy stiffly. "He offers riches beyond measure."

Amalia's parents were pleased, but Amalia wrinkled her nose. "Is his castle dusty?" she asked.

The envoy looked aghast. "His Majesty's castle is spotless! Cleaned daily by a hundred servants!"

"Then I shall not go," said Amalia firmly. "It sounds terribly boring."

Her parents despaired. King Borin was not one to be refused lightly. They pleaded with Amalia. At last, she said, "Very well. I shall set King Borin a task. If he can bring me three handfuls of Truly Interesting Dust, gathered from his own kingdom, I shall consider his suit."

The envoy returned to King Borin with this strange request. King Borin scoffed. "Dust? Interesting dust? Nonsense! But fetch me some dust, any dust!"

Servants swept the cleanest corners of the castle and brought King Borin three silk bags filled with ordinary grey dust. He sent these to Princess Amalia.

Amalia opened the bags, peered at the contents, and sneezed. "This is just common floor dust," she declared. "Utterly uninteresting. Tell King Borin he has failed."

King Borin was furious. He sent his envoy back. "Tell the Princess," he roared, "that *she* must come here and find this 'Interesting Dust' herself! If she fails within three days, she marries me anyway!"

Amalia, surprisingly, agreed. "Perhaps his kingdom is not entirely dull if it requires searching," she mused. She packed a small bag, including several empty crystal jars.

She arrived in King Borin's grey kingdom. Everything was swept, scrubbed, and grey. King Borin met her, impatient. "Well? Find your dust, Princess!"

Amalia wandered through the spotless castle. No sunbeam dust, no velvet dust. She went into the grey town. The streets were swept bare. She sighed. On the second day, she walked out into the countryside. It too seemed grey and orderly. She sat sadly by a grey stone wall.

Then she noticed something. Tucked into a crevice in the wall was a tiny, bright blue flower she had never seen before. Beside it, clinging to the stone, was a minuscule dusting of pollen, bright blue like the flower. "Aha!" she whispered. Carefully, she collected the Blue Pollen Dust into a tiny jar. "Flower Dust - Stone Wall," she labelled it. That was *one* interesting dust.

She walked further and came to a cave hidden behind some grey bushes. Inside, the walls glittered faintly. Tiny, almost invisible sparks seemed to drift in the air. She held out a jar, and slowly, some of the glittering specks settled inside. They glowed dimly. "Cave Spark Dust," she labelled it. *Two* interesting dusts.

The third day dawned. She needed one more. She climbed a windswept, grey hill. At the very top stood a single, gnarled, ancient tree, struck long ago by lightning. Its bark was charred black. Amalia felt drawn to it. She touched the blackened bark. A fine, silvery-black powder came off on her fingers. It shimmered oddly in the grey light. "Lightning Tree Dust," she murmured, carefully collecting it. *Three* interesting dusts.

She returned to King Borin's castle just as the third day ended. She presented her three small jars. King Borin peered at them suspiciously. "This is dust?"

"This," said Amalia, holding up the first jar, "is Blue Pollen Dust from a flower hiding in your walls. This," showing the second, "is Cave Spark Dust that glows in the dark. And this," showing the third, "is Lightning Tree Dust from the ancient tree on the hill."

King Borin looked from the jars to the Princess. He saw the blue flower dust, the glowing spark dust, the shimmering lightning dust. He looked around his grey, spotless castle, and his grey town. He had never noticed flowers in walls, or glowing caves, or ancient lightning-struck trees. He had only seen things to be cleaned or controlled.

Suddenly, his kingdom felt terribly boring, just as the Princess had said. He looked at Amalia, who was gazing fondly at her dust jars.

"Princess," King Borin said slowly, "you have found interest where I saw none. You have shown me my kingdom is not entirely grey. Keep your dusts. You... you do not have to marry me. Perhaps you could... tell me more about this Lightning Tree?"

Amalia smiled. She did not marry King Borin, but she stayed for a week, showing him the hidden flower, the sparking cave, and the ancient tree. King Borin learned to see the little bits of colour and wonder in his own grey land. And Princess Amalia returned home with three jars of the most interesting dust she had ever collected.

The Tailor Who Mended the Moon

There once was a tailor, known through three villages for his nimble fingers, but also for his boastful tongue. "There is naught I cannot mend!" he would declare in the inn. "A torn stocking, a ripped sail, aye, even a crack in the king's crown, if need be!"

One night, as the tailor boasted thus, a little imp with eyes like sparks and ears like bat wings perched unseen on the windowsill. The imp grinned, showing needle-sharp teeth. "Mend anything, can he?" the imp whispered to itself. "We shall see!"

The imp flew up, up, up into the night sky, higher than any bird. It carried a pair of tiny, wickedly sharp scissors made of shadow and spite. When it reached the full moon, shining bright and round, the imp snipped a jagged little hole right near the edge! A tiny sliver of moonlight fell down to earth like a dropped coin.

The next morning, people looked up and gasped. "Look! The moon is torn!" they cried. There was indeed a small, dark hole in the otherwise perfect moon. Panic spread. Would the sky unravel? Would the stars fall out?

Soon, the talk reached the tailor. The villagers gathered at his shop. "Tailor," said the mayor, "you boasted you could mend anything! Look, the moon is torn! You must fix it, or we shall run you out of town for a boastful fool!"

The tailor went pale. He looked up at the hole in the moon. He had only meant he was good with cloth! But his pride would not let him admit it. "Of course, I can mend it," he stammered. "A simple tear. Needs... needs a sturdy patch."

But how to reach the moon? He climbed the church steeple, but the moon was still far away. He tried to fly a kite with a needle and thread attached, but the thread broke. He despaired.

Then, sitting glumly in his shop, he noticed his biggest spool of the strongest, silver thread he used for noblemen's coats. An idea sparked, as foolish as his boast. "If I cannot climb to the moon," he thought, "perhaps I can pull the moon to me!"

He took the spool of silver thread outside. He fashioned a tiny, perfect loop at one end. Then, with a mighty heave, borrowing the technique of lads throwing stones, he flung the loop up towards the moon. Once, twice, three times he threw. On the third try, helped perhaps by a mischievous breeze (or the imp wanting more fun), the silver loop caught neatly around the jagged edge of the hole in the moon!

The tailor gasped. It had worked! Now, he tied the other end of the thread firmly to the village well-head, the strongest thing he could find. He pulled. Nothing happened. He got three stout men to help him pull. The thread held, but the moon did not budge.

"We need more pull!" cried the tailor, caught up in his own absurdity. He ran about the village. "Everyone! Come pull the moon!"

The villagers, bewildered but desperate, came. Men, women, children, they all took hold of the silver thread. "Heave!" cried the tailor. They heaved. The thread stretched taut, humming like a bowstring. But the moon stayed stubbornly in the sky.

High above, the imp watched and giggled, shaking its shadowy sides.

Suddenly, the oldest woman in the village, Granny Willow, hobbled forward. "You fools," she cackled, tapping the taut thread. "Pulling the moon down? You'll pull the well-head up first! You need to *climb* the thread, tailor!"

The tailor stared at the thin silver thread stretching impossibly up into the sky. Climb *that*? But all eyes were on him. Taking a deep breath, and knotting the thread around his waist, he began to climb, hand over hand, like a spider on its silk.

Up and up he went, the village shrinking below. The air grew thin. He climbed through clouds. At last, heart pounding, he reached the edge of the moon. It felt cool and smooth, like polished bone. He pulled himself onto its surface. The hole was right there, a clean snip through the moonlight.

He took out his strongest needle and a patch cut from his own silver waistcoat lining. Sitting cross-legged on the moon, the little tailor carefully stitched the patch over the hole. His stitches were neat and tiny, the best work he had ever done. When he finished, the patch blended in perfectly. The hole was gone.

He looked down. How to return? The thread stretched below him, impossibly thin. Just then, the imp appeared beside him, holding the shadow scissors. "Well done, tailor," it snickered. "You mended it indeed." And with a snip, the imp cut the silver thread near the moon.

"Hey!" cried the tailor as the thread fell away. He was stranded!

But as he watched the thread fall, it seemed to catch on a passing cloud. And then another cloud below that. And another. It formed a soft, cloud-like ladder reaching down, down, down. The imp winked and vanished.

Carefully, the tailor climbed down the cloud-ladder. He stepped off the last cloud onto the church steeple, then climbed down to the cheering villagers below. He was hailed as a hero, the Tailor Who Mended the Moon. He never boasted quite so loudly again, but he did sometimes tell the tale, leaving out the part about pulling on the well-head. And some say, if you look very closely at the full moon, you can still see the faint outline of the tailor's silver patch.




The Argumentative Echo

In a valley nestled between two stony mountains, there lived an Echo. For years it had done its duty faithfully, repeating the calls of shepherds, the shouts of lost travellers, and the occasional yodel of a wandering minstrel. But one day, the Echo grew bored. "Repeat, repeat, repeat," it mumbled to itself (which sounded like *repeat, repeat, repeat* fading softly). "Is that all there is?"

From that day on, the Echo decided to have opinions.

A shepherd called, "Lost my sheep!"
The Echo called back, "Serves you right!" (*right... right...*)

A maiden sang a sad song of lost love.
The Echo retorted, "He wasn't worth it!" (*worth it... worth it...*)

A merchant counting his money muttered, "Forty-one, forty-two..."
The Echo interrupted, "Try working for it!" (*for it... for it...*)

People began to avoid the Valley of the Argumentative Echo, for it was quite disconcerting.

Now, there also lived near this valley a Woodsman named Grum. He was known for his sour temper and his love of arguing. He heard tales of this rude Echo and scoffed. "An Echo arguing? Bah! Nonsense! I'll go give it a piece of my mind!"

He stomped into the valley, axe over his shoulder. "Echo!" he bellowed. "Are you there?"
"Of course I'm here, fool!" the Echo boomed back instantly. (*fool... fool...*)

Grum's face turned red. "Who are you calling a fool?"
"Who do YOU think, blockhead?" replied the Echo. (*blockhead... blockhead...*)

"I am Grum the Woodsman, the strongest man in these parts!" Grum shouted, puffing his chest.
"Strong maybe, smart no!" the Echo retorted. (*smart no... smart no...*)

"Why you insolent... air!" sputtered Grum. "I'll chop you down!"
"Try it! You'll only tire yourself out!" sneered the Echo. (*tire yourself out... out...*)

Grum swung his axe mightily against the cliff face. Chips of rock flew.
"Ha! Missed me!" laughed the Echo. (*missed me... missed me...*)

Grum chopped again, harder. Sweat beaded on his brow.
"Getting tired yet, old man?" mocked the Echo. (*old man... old man...*)

"I am NOT old!" roared Grum, chopping furiously.
"Getting older by the minute!" the Echo replied cheerfully. (*minute... minute...*)

They went on like this for nigh on an hour. Grum shouted insults; the Echo hurled them back, often adding a little twist. Grum chopped at rocks; the Echo laughed. The birds stopped singing to listen. A curious fox peered from behind a bush.

At last, Grum was exhausted. His arms ached. His throat was sore. He leaned on his axe, panting. "Alright, Echo," he gasped grudgingly. "You win this time. You're... you're a terrible conversationalist."
There was a pause. Then the Echo called back, slightly less sharp, "Takes one to know one!" (*know one... know one...*)

Grum actually chuckled, a rare sound. He wiped his brow. "Perhaps you're right," he admitted. He shouldered his axe. "Well, I'm going home for supper."
"Good idea! Don't trip!" the Echo advised, almost friendly. (*trip... trip...*)

Grum stomped out of the valley, tired but strangely less grumpy than usual. He had met his match, and it was nothing but air and rock. From then on, he sometimes went back to the valley, not to chop, but just to argue with the Echo for entertainment. And the Echo, finding someone who enjoyed a good argument as much as it did, became slightly less rude to other travellers, saving its sharpest retorts for Grum the Woodsman.




The Knight Whose Armour Rusted Shut

Sir Reginald the Resplendent was a knight. Or rather, he owned the armour of a knight. It was exceedingly shiny, with plumes and engravings, though truth be told, the metal was cheap tin polished to a high gleam. Sir Reginald loved his armour more than anything. He wore it constantly: to feasts, to market, even, some whispered, to bed. He polished it daily but refused ever to take it off, fearing it might get scratched, or worse, that someone might see him without it and realize he wasn't quite so resplendent underneath.

One soggy afternoon, Sir Reginald was riding through a drizzle (he refused to let mere weather keep his magnificence indoors). The drizzle turned to a downpour. Sir Reginald, snug in his tin suit, rode on until he reached a small inn for shelter. As he tried to dismount, he found his joints stiff. Alarmingly stiff. When he reached the inn door and tried to raise his visor to call the innkeeper, it wouldn't budge. He tried to bend his elbow – stuck fast! He tried to lift his knee – locked solid! The cheap tin armour, soaked by the rain, had rusted shut at every joint! Sir Reginald was trapped inside his own resplendence.

Panic seized him. He couldn't get off his horse! He couldn't raise his visor! He couldn't even bend to knock! He sat there on his horse like a tin statue in the pouring rain.

Presently, the innkeeper's daughter, a rosy-cheeked girl named Polly, peered out. "Lawks, Sir Knight!" she exclaimed. "Are you alright? You're getting soaked!"

Sir Reginald tried to sound nonchalant, his voice muffled behind the closed visor. "Ahem! Merely... merely enjoying the invigorating precipitation, my good girl!"

"But shouldn't you come inside?" Polly asked. "Your horse looks tired."

"Ah... no need, no need!" Sir Reginald squeaked, trying desperately to shift in his saddle and failing. "Just... admiring the architecture of your fine establishment!" (It was a very plain inn).

Polly looked puzzled but went back inside. Sir Reginald groaned. How could he get help without revealing his embarrassing plight?

Next, a blacksmith came trudging down the road, hammer over his shoulder. "Hullo, Sir Knight!" the blacksmith called. "Caught in the wet, are we? Need a hand with your horse?"

"Greetings, worthy smith!" boomed Sir Reginald, trying for heartiness. "My steed is perfectly content! Just... testing the durability of my superb armour against the elements!"

The blacksmith squinted at the armour, noticing a few tell-tale orange streaks appearing through the polish. "Looks like it could use a bit o' oil at the joints, Sir," he observed. "Happy to oblige, back at my forge?"

"No! I mean... unnecessary!" choked Sir Reginald. "Perfect working order! Smooth as silk!" He tried to wave dismissively, but his arm remained rigid.

The blacksmith shrugged and walked on, muttering about proud knights. Sir Reginald felt despair. He was stuck fast, and darkness was falling.

Then, a troop of travelling acrobats tumbled into the inn yard, seeking shelter. They saw the knight sitting motionless on his horse. "Look!" cried the leader, a nimble fellow in motley. "A statue! How wonderfully lifelike!"

One acrobat tried to climb onto the horse behind Sir Reginald. Another balanced a ball on his helmet. Sir Reginald, unable to move or protest effectively, could only make muffled spluttering noises from behind his visor. "Unhand me, varlets! Desist!"

"It talks!" shrieked a tumbler, tumbling right off the horse in surprise.

Just then, Polly came out again with a lantern. She saw the acrobats clambering over the knight. "Leave Sir Reginald alone!" she cried. "Can't you see he's... indisposed?" She looked closely at the rusted joints, the knight's rigid posture. Understanding dawned in her eyes. She suppressed a giggle.

"Acrobats," she said sweetly, "perhaps you could help the good knight *dismount*? He seems a bit... stiff."

The acrobats, always up for a challenge, swarmed around. Using their combined strength and gymnastic skill, they managed, with much grunting and heaving (from them) and muffled yelps (from Sir Reginald), to lift the entire knight, armour and all, off the horse and carry him like a log into the inn's stable. They propped him against a hay bale.

"There you go, Sir Statue!" chirped the leader, bowing.

Polly thanked them and shooed them inside. She returned to the stable with a can of oil and a rag. "Don't worry, Sir Reginald," she whispered conspiratorially through his visor's slit. "Your secret's safe with me. Let's see if we can loosen you up."

With Polly's patient oiling and gentle prying, first the visor creaked open, revealing the knight's very red and embarrassed face. Then, one by one, the elbow joints, the knee joints, the neck joint – they all groaned free. At last, Sir Reginald could move again. He stood up, stiffly, his armour streaked with rust and oil.

He looked at Polly, deeply humbled. "My... my thanks, lass," he mumbled, avoiding her gaze. "I have been... a fool."

"Aye, maybe a bit," Polly smiled kindly. "But even tin knights need help sometimes. Now, come inside for some warm soup."

Sir Reginald, stripped of his rusty armour (which the blacksmith later helped him remove entirely), sat by the inn fire in borrowed clothes, feeling remarkably comfortable. He learned that day that true resplendence wasn't about shiny armour you couldn't take off, but perhaps about accepting help when you were rusted shut.




The King Who Lost His Beard

King Theodore the Tremendous was a good king, fair and just, but he possessed one great vanity: his magnificent beard. It was long, glossy, and black as a raven's wing, flowing down to his ample belly. He brushed it one hundred strokes each morning and slept with it tucked into a special silken bag. The Royal Beard-Comber was one of the most important positions at court.

One afternoon, Fumblemore the Forgetful, the court wizard (kept mostly for predicting rain and finding lost spectacles), was demonstrating a new spell. It was supposed to turn turnips into teacups. Fumblemore waved his wand, chanted, "Abraca-turnip, teacup-a-zam!" but he tripped over his own long robes at the crucial moment. The wand flew sideways, a puff of purple smoke shot out, and instead of hitting the turnip, it hit King Theodore squarely on the chin.

Poof! The King's magnificent beard vanished utterly. Not a whisker remained. His chin, unseen for thirty years, was revealed to be round, pink, and surprisingly small.

There was a shocked silence in the throne room. Fumblemore gasped, "Oh dear. Wrong... target." The King let out a strangled cry, feeling his smooth chin. Then he roared, a sound that rattled the stained-glass windows. "My beard! Wizard, you clumsy oaf! Find my beard! Restore it at once!"

But Fumblemore, terrified, grabbed his turnip and vanished himself in another, less accurate puff of smoke, leaving behind only a faint smell of singed parsnip.

The King was distraught. He couldn't rule! He couldn't feast! He couldn't even look in a mirror without weeping! What would the neighbouring kingdoms say? How could he lead his knights with a chin like a baby bird's?

"No one must see!" he declared. He locked himself in his chambers. He ordered the Royal Beard-Comber (now unemployed) to fetch him disguises. First, they tried tying a large black silk scarf around his lower face. He looked like a bandit with a toothache. Then, they tried a false beard made of goat hair. It was scratchy and smelled faintly of cheese. Next, a beard fashioned from raven feathers. It tickled his nose and shed feathers whenever he spoke. He tried simply holding a royal proclamation permanently in front of his chin, but it made eating soup impossible.

Desperate, the King decided he must find Fumblemore. Disguised in the goat-hair beard and a floppy peasant's hat, he slipped out of the castle by a side gate. He asked passers-by if they had seen a forgetful wizard smelling faintly of singed parsnip.

He followed rumour and hearsay. A farmer said Fumblemore had tried to turn his scarecrow into a serving maid, resulting only in a scarecrow wearing an apron. A baker reported Fumblemore had accidentally enchanted his loaves to sing sea shanties, causing much confusion. A goose-girl claimed he'd turned the pond green and the geese orange for an hour.

The King, growing increasingly itchy under his false beard, trailed Fumblemore across the kingdom. He arrived at a windmill just as Fumblemore was attempting to magically speed up the sails. Instead, the windmill shuddered, groaned, and began slowly spinning backwards. Fumblemore sighed, scratching his head.

"Wizard!" croaked the King, forgetting his disguise in his frustration.

Fumblemore jumped, saw the goat-bearded figure, and yelped, "Your Majesty! Er... lovely disguise! Very... rustic!"

"Never mind the disguise, Fumblemore!" snapped the King. "My beard! Reverse the spell!"

"Ah," said Fumblemore, wringing his hands. "The Beard-Be-Gone hex. Tricky reversal. Needs a specific counter-charm. Requires... yes... the tear of a laughing onion, the sigh of a contented teapot, and precisely three red hairs from a badger that knows multiplication."

The King stared. "Are you jesting, wizard?"

"Alas, no, Your Majesty," sighed Fumblemore. "Magic is specific. Especially accidental magic."

So began another quest. The King, still disguised, and the wizard travelled together. Finding a laughing onion involved telling it jokes until it wept tears of mirth (which took two days and many bad puns). Capturing the sigh of a contented teapot required brewing the perfect cup of tea and listening very closely with a special funnel Fumblemore fashioned from a cabbage leaf. Finding the badger was hardest. They finally located one near an old scholar's cottage. Fumblemore tried asking it multiplication questions ("What's three times four, old fellow?"), but the badger just blinked. At last, the King, exasperated, simply offered the badger a piece of honey-cake. While the badger munched contentedly, the King quickly plucked three reddish hairs from its flank.

They returned to the castle with the ingredients. Fumblemore mixed them in a bowl, chanted, "Beardius Returnius, Follicle-Grow-Glorious!" and dabbed the concoction on the King's chin.

Slowly, miraculously, the beard began to grow back. Inch by inch, glossy and black, it flowed forth until it was restored to its full, magnificent glory. The King wept with joy, stroking it fondly.

He looked at Fumblemore, who beamed nervously. "Well done, wizard," the King said, surprisingly calm now his beard was back. "You are still forgetful, and clumsy, but you fixed it. Now... about those turnips..."

King Theodore kept Fumblemore as his court wizard, though he made him practice his spells only in the turnip patch. And the King, while still proud of his beard, perhaps held it a little less tightly, remembering the itchy goat hair and the kindness of a badger with a sweet tooth.
