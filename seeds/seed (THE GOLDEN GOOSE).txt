    {
      "Plot Function": "This sentence introduces the protagonist, Dummling, his familial context as the youngest of three sons, and his initial social standing as someone who is consistently looked down upon. It establishes the classic fairy tale setup of the underestimated hero.",
      "Grimm Style": "The opening 'There was a man who had three sons...' is a quintessential fairy tale formula. The language is simple and direct, using common words. The description of Dummling being 'despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion' is a clear, unadorned statement of his status, typical of the matter-of-fact tone. The number three is a common motif.",
      "Moral Implication": "The initial portrayal of Dummling sets the stage for a moral about judging by appearances or societal labels. His low status implies that true worth may be hidden or unrecognized, and the narrative will likely subvert this initial perception.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Dummling embodies the 'Underestimated Youngest/Simpleton' archetype, representing undervalued or unconscious parts of the psyche. His despised status suggests the societal or familial rejection of qualities like simplicity, intuition, or closeness to nature, which the ego (represented by 'clever' brothers) might scorn. The journey will be one of individuation where this 'simple' aspect proves its worth.",
      "Sentence": "There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.",

    {
      "Plot Function": "This footnote clarifies the meaning of 'Dummling,' explicitly translating it to 'Simpleton.' It reinforces the character's label and the perception others have of him.",
      "Grimm Style": "As a footnote, this is an editorial addition for clarity rather than a narrative element of the original tale. However, its directness ('Simpleton') aligns with the Grimm style of providing straightforward information.",
      "Moral Implication": "The explicit label 'Simpleton' underscores the societal judgment placed upon Dummling. The story's progression will challenge this label, implying that true wisdom or worth isn't always recognized by conventional standards.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The label 'Simpleton' directly points to the archetype. Psychologically, this 'simplicity' can be a form of openness to the unconscious, contrasting with the more rigid, rational 'cleverness' of his brothers. It is often this perceived lack of sophistication that allows for connection with magical or instinctual realms.",

    {
      "Plot Function": "This sentence initiates the first part of the narrative pattern: the eldest son's attempt at a task (hewing wood). It also introduces the element of parental provision (cake and wine), which will serve as a test.",
      "Grimm Style": "The phrase 'It happened that...' is a common transitional device. The description of the provisions ('beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine') uses simple, functional adjectives. The motivation ('in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst') is stated plainly.",
      "Moral Implication": "The mother's provision for the eldest son with 'beautiful sweet cake and wine' contrasts with what Dummling later receives. This sets up a test of character: how will the sons use their resources, particularly when faced with someone in need?",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The journey into the forest is a classic metaphor for venturing into the unconscious or facing a trial. The provisions can symbolize innate gifts, talents, or resources. The eldest son represents the conventional, perhaps ego-driven approach, equipped with the 'best' resources.",
      "Sentence": "It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.",

    {
      "Plot Function": "The eldest son encounters the 'Helper' archetype in the form of the little grey-haired old man. The man makes a simple request, which is the first test of character.",
      "Grimm Style": "The appearance of 'a little grey-haired old man' is a typical introduction of a magical helper or tester. His speech is direct and polite ('bade him good day') and his request is simple and based on need ('I am so hungry and thirsty'). The use of 'draught' is a slightly archaic touch.",
      "Moral Implication": "This is the critical moral test: will the son show kindness and share his provisions? The old man's humility and need highlight the opportunity for charity.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The little old man represents the 'Wise Old Man' archetype or a messenger from the unconscious. His appearance tests the son's attitude towards the 'other' or the seemingly insignificant. Encountering him signifies an opportunity for the ego to connect with deeper wisdom or to demonstrate generosity, which often unlocks further aid.",
      "Sentence": "When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’",

    },
    {
      "Plot Function": "The eldest son fails the test. He selfishly refuses to share, prioritizing his own needs and dismissing the old man.",
      "Grimm Style": "The son is labeled 'clever,' which in Grimm tales often has a negative connotation when paired with unkindness. His response is blunt and self-serving ('If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you'). The narrator states simply, 'he left the little man standing and went on,' showing the action without emotional commentary.",
      "Moral Implication": "This demonstrates the negative trait of selfishness and lack of compassion. The 'clever' son's logic is purely self-preservation without empathy, which is morally condemned in these tales. This failure will lead to punishment.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'clever' son's response symbolizes the ego's refusal to share its resources or to acknowledge the needs of the 'other' (which could be an unacknowledged part of the self or a genuine external call for empathy). This cutting off from connection and generosity leads to a negative outcome, a form of psychic injury or block.",
      "Sentence": "But the clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing and went on.",

    {
      "Plot Function": "The eldest son faces immediate negative consequences for his selfishness. His attempt to hew wood results in injury.",
      "Grimm Style": "The cause and effect are swift and direct. 'It was not long before he made a false stroke' shows the immediacy of the punishment. The description of the injury is factual ('the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up').",
      "Moral Implication": "This illustrates the principle of direct retribution for unkind actions. The punishment is fitting: his attempt to preserve all for himself leads to an inability to perform his task and sustain an injury. It's a clear example of 'Punishment and Reward' structure.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The injury symbolizes a self-inflicted wound resulting from a negative attitude or action. By refusing the connection with the 'Wise Old Man' (the helpful unconscious aspect), the ego's efforts become counterproductive and harmful to itself. The 'false stroke' suggests a misapplication of energy or skill.",
      "Sentence": "But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up.",

    {
      "Plot Function": "This sentence explicitly attributes the eldest son's misfortune to the little grey man, confirming the magical nature of the encounter and the consequence of the son's actions.",
      "Grimm Style": "A simple, declarative statement typical of the omniscient narrator in Grimm tales. It leaves no ambiguity about the cause of the injury, reinforcing the magical justice at play.",
      "Moral Implication": "It reinforces the moral that actions towards seemingly insignificant beings can have significant, supernaturally enforced consequences. The little grey man is not just a beggar but an arbiter of fortune.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "This attributes the 'self-sabotage' to the slighted unconscious or numinous power. When the archetypal 'Wise Old Man' or 'Helper' is dismissed or treated poorly, the psychic energy they represent can manifest as obstacles or 'bad luck' for the ego that has not shown proper respect or made the necessary connection/sacrifice.",

    },
    {
      "Plot Function": "The narrative structure repeats with the second son. He is also equipped with good provisions by his mother, setting up a parallel test.",
      "Grimm Style": "The repetition ('After this the second son went...') is a common structural device in fairy tales, often occurring in threes. The parallel provisioning ('his mother gave him, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine') emphasizes that he has the same opportunity as the first.",
      "Moral Implication": "The repetition sets an expectation: will the second son learn from his brother's (implied) failure or act differently? It provides another chance for the moral of generosity to be demonstrated or ignored.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The second son represents another attempt by the psyche (or another aspect of the ego) to approach the trial. He is given the same symbolic resources. The repetition emphasizes the importance of the test and the lesson to be learned.",
      "Sentence": "After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine.",

      "Plot Function": "The second son encounters the same little old grey man, who makes the same request. This directly parallels the eldest son's encounter, highlighting the repetitive nature of the test.",
      "Grimm Style": "The use of 'likewise' emphasizes the parallelism. The old man's request is identical, maintaining consistency in the trial. Simple and direct interaction.",
      "Moral Implication": "The test of charity and kindness is presented again. The repetition stresses the importance of this moral choice.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The recurrent encounter with the 'Wise Old Man' figure suggests a persistent call from the unconscious or a recurring life lesson that needs to be addressed. The psyche is presented with the same opportunity for connection and generosity.",
      "Sentence": "The little old grey man met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.",

    {
      "Plot Function": "The second son also fails the test, responding with similar selfishness as the first, though his reasoning is framed as 'sensibly enough' by the narrator, perhaps ironically.",
      "Grimm Style": "The narrator's comment 'sensibly enough' is interesting; it might reflect a worldly, pragmatic view that the tale then undermines with supernatural consequences. The son's justification ('What I give you will be taken away from myself; be off!') is almost identical to the first's, showing no learning or difference in character.",
      "Moral Implication": "The second son's failure reinforces the moral condemnation of selfishness. The phrase 'sensibly enough' highlights the conflict between worldly 'sense' (which is self-preserving) and the fairy tale's higher moral of generosity, which leads to reward.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "This son also represents an ego-centric perspective that prioritizes self-preservation over connection or sharing. The 'sensibly enough' suggests a rationalization that, while logical on a mundane level, fails to grasp the deeper, magical reality of the situation. He too misses the opportunity offered by the unconscious helper.",
      "Sentence": "But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and went on.",

The injury description ('he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be carried home') is factual and brief. The parallel structure highlights the consistent consequences of their behavior.",
      "Moral Implication": "This reinforces the theme of direct retribution. Selfishness consistently leads to self-harm or failure. The story shows that what the brothers deem 'sensible' is, in the magical logic of the tale, foolish and detrimental.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The injury, like the first, symbolizes a self-inflicted wound from a misaligned approach. The repetition of failure for the first two sons, who represent conventional or ego-driven approaches, sets the stage for the third, 'simple' son to succeed through a different mode of being.",

      "Moral Implication": "Dummling's willingness to try, despite being despised and his brothers' failures, suggests a certain bravery or perhaps a naivety that will prove beneficial. It hints at the moral that those dismissed by society might possess hidden strengths or virtues.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'Simpleton' archetype steps forward. This signifies the emergence of the undervalued, intuitive, or unconscious aspect of the psyche, which offers a new approach after the failure of more conventional, ego-driven strategies (represented by the brothers).",

      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The father figure here could represent societal conditioning or the established ego's resistance to allowing a 'lesser,' more instinctual part of the self (Dummling) to take the lead, especially after 'superior' parts have failed. The father's words reflect the internal critic or the voice of past failures.",

      "Moral Implication": "Dummling's persistence, despite discouragement, is a positive trait. The father's comment implies that wisdom can come through suffering or mistakes, ironically foreshadowing Dummling's success which comes through different means.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Dummling's persistence suggests the quiet insistence of the unconscious or the intuitive self to be heard and allowed to act. The father's reluctant consent signifies a grudging allowance by the dominant psychic structure for this 'simpler' aspect to attempt the task. The expectation of 'hurting himself' reflects the ego's projection of its own vulnerabilities onto this 'lesser' part.",

      "Moral Implication": "Despite receiving inferior provisions, Dummling will succeed where his brothers failed. This implies that material advantages are not the key to success; character is. It also suggests the mother, like the father, has low expectations.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'cinder-cake and sour beer' symbolize humble, unrefined, or seemingly worthless resources. Psychologically, this suggests that the 'Simpleton' archetype operates with less ego-inflation or fewer sophisticated defenses, relying on more basic, perhaps more authentic, inner qualities. These humble gifts will be magically transformed, indicating the transformative power of a good heart.",

Dummling's good heart, humility, and willingness to share, even his poor meal, are rewarded. This contrasts sharply with his brothers' selfishness.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Dummling's response signifies an openness and a willingness to connect, even with seemingly humble resources. He doesn't hoard what little he has.

This suggests that sometimes embracing or witnessing the absurd, the chaotic, or the 'shadow' aspects (represented by the foolishly stuck individuals) can release repressed emotional energy (laughter).

      "Sentence": "Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger as I?",

      "Plot Function": "The hungry man continues to describe his plight, emphasizing the severity of his hunger and his desperate measures to cope.",
      "Grimm Style": "The man's direct speech ('My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to die of hunger') conveys his suffering simply and effectively. It reinforces his suitability for the upcoming task.",
      "Moral Implication": "This highlights the extreme nature of the 'helper' Dummling finds. It suggests that solutions to enormous problems may come from equally enormous, albeit unusual, capacities.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The statement 'My stomach remains empty' despite eating signifies a profound psychic emptiness or an unfulfillable longing that cannot be satisfied by ordinary means. The need to 'tie himself up' to prevent death from hunger illustrates the potentially destructive power of such an unmanaged internal drive or deficiency if not properly channeled or satisfied.",

      "Grimm Style": "Dummling's gladness ('At this Dummling was glad') is stated simply. His offer ('Get up and come with me; you shall eat yourself full') is direct and confident, mirroring his earlier interaction with the thirsty man.",
      "Moral Implication": "Dummling's ability to see solutions in others' problems and his proactive approach are key to his success. His gladness is not just for himself but for the prospect of helping the suffering man.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Dummling's gladness shows his intuitive recognition of how this extreme hunger can meet the king's challenge. He acts as the conscious agent who can connect a specific, powerful unconscious drive (the man's hunger) with an external demand (the mountain of bread), thereby resolving both the man's suffering and his own task.",
      "Sentence": "At this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall eat yourself full.’",

      "Moral Implication": "The king spares no effort in creating these 'impossible' tasks, further highlighting his resistance. The sheer scale of the bread mountain underscores the magnitude of the challenge Dummling faces.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'mountain of bread' made from 'all the flour in the whole Kingdom' symbolizes an overwhelming abundance or an immense accumulation of resources (or perhaps problems, depending on context) that needs to be processed or consumed. It represents the totality of a certain kind of psychic material that must be dealt with.",
      "Sentence": "He led him to the king’s palace where all the flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge mountain of bread to be baked.",

      "Moral Implication": "Another 'impossible' task is overcome through Dummling's ability to find and utilize specialized help. It reinforces the theme that unconventional solutions are often necessary for extraordinary challenges.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The consumption of the 'mountain of bread' by the man with insatiable hunger represents the psyche's capacity to assimilate or process vast amounts of material (knowledge, experience, unresolved issues) when the appropriate energy or drive is engaged. What was an overwhelming challenge is completely 'digested' or integrated.",

      "Grimm Style": "The 'Rule of Three' is evident in Dummling's third request and the king's third task. The king 'again sought a way out,' emphasizing his continued reluctance. The task of a ship that sails on land and water is a classic magical, paradoxical object.",
      "Moral Implication": "The king's persistent unfairness and prejudice are stark. The third task is overtly magical, suggesting the king is now resorting to what he believes truly impossible, even beyond extraordinary human capacity. This will require direct magical intervention, not just specialized human skill.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The third task, requiring a magically versatile vessel, represents a need for a mode of being or consciousness that can navigate different realms—the conscious (land) and the unconscious (water), the material and the spiritual. This is often a symbol of the integrated Self or a transcendent function that can bridge opposites.",

      "Moral Implication": "The king sets a very specific and seemingly unattainable condition. This will be the ultimate test of Dummling's access to magical aid and his worthiness.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The act of 'sailing back' in such a ship symbolizes not just possessing the transcendent function, but demonstrating its mastery and successful return from the quest or the depths (the forest/unconscious where such a gift might be found). It's about bringing the integrated capacity back into the everyday world (the king's court).",

      "Moral Implication": "This emphasizes that the foundation of all Dummling's success is his initial good-heartedness. The original helper reappears for the most challenging task, showing the enduring power of that first act of charity.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "For the ultimate task, requiring true magic, Dummling returns to the primary source of unconscious aid (the Wise Old Man). This suggests that the deepest transformations or the acquisition of transcendent abilities comes from a direct connection with this core guiding archetype, whose favor was won through humility and generosity.",

      "Moral Implication": "This is the ultimate payoff for Dummling's initial act of sharing. The most difficult task is solved directly by the magical helper as a reward for proven virtue. It powerfully reinforces the story's central moral: kindness begets profound rewards.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'Wise Old Man' (representing the Self or deep unconscious wisdom) explicitly states that the highest gift (the magical ship/transcendent function) is given due to the ego's (Dummling's) past right attitude and actions. This highlights that access to the most profound psychic resources or transformative abilities is granted when the ego has demonstrated humility, generosity, and a correct relationship with the unconscious.",

      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The acquisition and presentation of the magical ship (symbol of integrated consciousness, ability to navigate all realms) is the undeniable proof of the hero's transformation and worthiness. The ruling psychic structure (king) can no longer resist the integration of this new, powerful element (Dummling and his connection to the Self/Anima).",

The 'simpleton' achieves ultimate success and happiness, demonstrating that inner worth triumphs over initial perception and societal prejudice.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The marriage to the princess symbolizes the union of the ego with the Anima, achieving psychological wholeness and integration. Inheriting the kingdom signifies the attainment of sovereignty over one's own psychic realm—the fully individuated Self. Living 'contentedly' suggests a state of harmony and balance achieved through the arduous journey of trials and integration.",

      "There was a man who had three sons, the youngest of whom was called Dummling,[*] and was despised, mocked, and sneered at on every occasion.",
      "[*] Simpleton",
      "It happened that the eldest wanted to go into the forest to hew wood, and before he went his mother gave him a beautiful sweet cake and a bottle of wine in order that he might not suffer from hunger or thirst.",
      "When he entered the forest he met a little grey-haired old man who bade him good day, and said: ‘Do give me a piece of cake out of your pocket, and let me have a draught of your wine; I am so hungry and thirsty.’",
      "But the clever son answered: ‘If I give you my cake and wine, I shall have none for myself; be off with you,’ and he left the little man standing and went on.",
      "But when he began to hew down a tree, it was not long before he made a false stroke, and the axe cut him in the arm, so that he had to go home and have it bound up.",
      "And this was the little grey man’s doing.",
      "After this the second son went into the forest, and his mother gave him, like the eldest, a cake and a bottle of wine.",
      "The little old grey man met him likewise, and asked him for a piece of cake and a drink of wine.",
      "But the second son, too, said sensibly enough: ‘What I give you will be taken away from myself; be off!’ and he left the little man standing and went on.",
      "His punishment, however, was not delayed; when he had made a few blows at the tree he struck himself in the leg, so that he had to be carried home.",
      "Then Dummling said: ‘Father, do let me go and cut wood.’",
      "The father answered: ‘Your brothers have hurt themselves with it, leave it alone, you do not understand anything about it.’",
      "But Dummling begged so long that at last he said: ‘Just go then, you will get wiser by hurting yourself.’",
      "His mother gave him a cake made with water and baked in the cinders, and with it a bottle of sour beer.",
      "When he came to the forest the little old grey man met him likewise, and greeting him, said: ‘Give me a piece of your cake and a drink out of your bottle; I am so hungry and thirsty.’",
      "Dummling answered: ‘I have only cinder-cake and sour beer; if that pleases you, we will sit down and eat.’",
      "So they sat down, and when Dummling pulled out his cinder-cake, it was a fine sweet cake, and the sour beer had become good wine.",
      "So they ate and drank, and after that the little man said: ‘Since you have a good heart, and are willing to divide what you have, I will give you good luck.",
      "There stands an old tree, cut it down, and you will find something at the roots.’",
      "Then the little man took leave of him.",
      "Dummling went and cut down the tree, and when it fell there was a goose sitting in the roots with feathers of pure gold.",
      "He lifted her up, and taking her with him, went to an inn where he thought he would stay the night.",
      "Now the host had three daughters, who saw the goose and were curious to know what such a wonderful bird might be, and would have liked to have one of its golden feathers.",
      "The eldest thought: ‘I shall soon find an opportunity of pulling out a feather,’ and as soon as Dummling had gone out she seized the goose by the wing, but her finger and hand remained sticking fast to it.",
      "The second came soon afterwards, thinking only of how she might get a feather for herself, but she had scarcely touched her sister than she was held fast.",
      "At last the third also came with the like intent, and the others screamed out: ‘Keep away; for goodness’ sake keep away!’",
      "But she did not understand why she was to keep away.",
      "‘The others are there,’ she thought, ‘I may as well be there too,’ and ran to them; but as soon as she had touched her sister, she remained sticking fast to her.",
      "So they had to spend the night with the goose.",
      "The next morning Dummling took the goose under his arm and set out, without troubling himself about the three girls who were hanging on to it.",
      "They were obliged to run after him continually, now left, now right, wherever his legs took him.",
      "In the middle of the fields the parson met them, and when he saw the procession he said: ‘For shame, you good-for-nothing girls, why are you running across the fields after this young man?",
      "Is that seemly?’",
      "At the same time he seized the youngest by the hand in order to pull her away, but as soon as he touched her he likewise stuck fast, and was himself obliged to run behind.",
      "Before long the sexton came by and saw his master, the parson, running behind three girls.",
      "He was astonished at this and called out: ‘Hi! your reverence, whither away so quickly?",
      "Do not forget that we have a christening today!’",
      "and running after him he took him by the sleeve, but was also held fast to it.",
      "Whilst the five were trotting thus one behind the other, two labourers came with their hoes from the fields; the parson called out to them and begged that they would set him and the sexton free.",
      "But they had scarcely touched the sexton when they were held fast, and now there were seven of them running behind Dummling and the goose.",
      "Soon afterwards he came to a city, where a king ruled who had a daughter who was so serious that no one could make her laugh.",
      "So he had put forth a decree that whosoever should be able to make her laugh should marry her.",
      "When Dummling heard this, he went with his goose and all her train before the king’s daughter, and as soon as she saw the seven people running on and on, one behind the other, she began to laugh quite loudly, and as if she would never stop.",
      "Thereupon Dummling asked to have her for his wife; but the king did not like the son-in-law, and made all manner of excuses and said he must first produce a man who could drink a cellarful of wine.",
      "Dummling thought of the little grey man, who could certainly help him; so he went into the forest, and in the same place where he had felled the tree, he saw a man sitting, who had a very sorrowful face.",
      "Dummling asked him what he was taking to heart so sorely, and he answered: ‘I have such a great thirst and cannot quench it; cold water I cannot stand, a barrel of wine I have just emptied, but that to me is like a drop on a hot stone!’",
      "‘There, I can help you,’ said Dummling, ‘just come with me and you shall be satisfied.’",
      "He led him into the king’s cellar, and the man bent over the huge barrels, and drank and drank till his loins hurt, and before the day was out he had emptied all the barrels.",
      "Then Dummling asked once more for his bride, but the king was vexed that such an ugly fellow, whom everyone called Dummling, should take away his daughter, and he made a new condition; he must first find a man who could eat a whole mountain of bread.",
      "Dummling did not think long, but went straight into the forest, where in the same place there sat a man who was tying up his body with a strap, and making an awful face, and saying: ‘I have eaten a whole ovenful of rolls, but what good is that when one has such a hunger as I?",
      "My stomach remains empty, and I must tie myself up if I am not to die of hunger.’",
      "At this Dummling was glad, and said: ‘Get up and come with me; you shall eat yourself full.’",
      "He led him to the king’s palace where all the flour in the whole Kingdom was collected, and from it he caused a huge mountain of bread to be baked.",
      "The man from the forest stood before it, began to eat, and by the end of one day the whole mountain had vanished.",
