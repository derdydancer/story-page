    {
      "Plot Function": "Establishes the initial situation of the story: a kingdom in transition and a vulnerable royal family. Introduces the protagonist's lineage and the reason for her mother's sole guardianship. This sets the stage for the princess's upbringing and future journey.",
      "Grimm Style": "Classic fairy tale opening with the death of a king, creating an immediate shift in power and focus. Language is simple, direct ('died', 'left his queen'). Archetypal characters ('king', 'queen', 'child') and setting ('a great land') are used, typical of Grimm's style. Focus on familial roles and succession.",
      "Moral Implication": "This sentence subtly implies the responsibilities of leadership and parenthood. The queen's duty to care for the child highlights the theme of parental obligation. The loss of the king also introduces a note of potential instability or the need for the remaining family to be resilient.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The death of the king represents the absence or weakening of the traditional ruling principle (Logos, masculine authority). The queen's rise to guardianship signifies the prominence of the feminine principle (Eros, maternal care) in the protagonist's early life. The 'only child' is the nascent Ego, initially defined by this maternal environment, foreshadowing a journey towards integrating other aspects of the psyche.",
      "Sentence": "The king of a great land died, and left his queen to take care of their only child.",

    {
      "Plot Function": "Introduces the protagonist, the princess, and establishes her key characteristics: her gender, beauty, and the loving relationship she shares with her mother. This provides essential background information and sets up the reader's empathy for her.",
      "Grimm Style": "Direct character description using simple, positive adjectives ('very beautiful', 'loved her dearly', 'very kind'). The sentence structure is compound, linked by 'and', maintaining simplicity. The princess embodies the archetypal beautiful maiden.",
      "Moral Implication": "Highlights the virtue of maternal love and kindness as an ideal. Beauty is presented as an innate quality of the princess, often a marker of inherent goodness or special destiny in fairy tales. This loving upbringing forms a stark contrast to the harsh trials she will later face, emphasizing the cruelty of those who harm her.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'very beautiful' daughter can symbolize innate purity, the soul (Anima in its nascent form), or untouched potential. The loving mother embodies the nurturing aspect of the Great Mother archetype, providing a secure, 'good enough' initial environment for the Ego. This period of being 'loved dearly' represents a state of initial wholeness or paradise, from which the hero must eventually depart to undergo individuation.",
      "Sentence": "This child was a daughter, who was very beautiful; and her mother loved her dearly, and was very kind to her.",

    {
      "Plot Function": "Introduces a supernatural protective element in the princess's life – the good fairy. This fairy acts as a secondary guardian, reinforcing the idea that the princess is special and watched over. Foreshadows magical assistance in the narrative.",
      "Grimm Style": "Inclusion of a 'good fairy', a common magical helper archetype in Grimm's tales. The fairy's role is benevolent ('fond of the princess', 'helped her mother to watch over her'). Simple language describes the fairy's positive influence. This aligns with the 'Grateful Animals/Supernatural Helpers' structure.",
      "Moral Implication": "Suggests that goodness and innocence attract benevolent supernatural protection. The fairy's presence implies a higher order of care or destiny guiding the princess. It reinforces the idea that the princess is worthy of such protection.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'good fairy' can be interpreted as a symbol of benign ancestral spirits, Providence, or positive unconscious forces (e.g., helpful intuition, synchronicity) supporting the Ego's development. She represents the 'Wise Old Woman' or 'Helpful Helper' archetype, ensuring that even in a world where the primary masculine protector (king) is absent, there are other forms of guidance and aid available.",
      "Sentence": "And there was a good fairy too, who was fond of the princess, and helped her mother to watch over her.",

      "Plot Function": "Marks a significant transition in the princess's life: her coming of age and betrothal. This event propels the narrative forward, initiating the journey that forms the core of the story. The 'great way off' location establishes the journey's significance and potential dangers.",
      "Grimm Style": "Typical fairy tale progression: childhood to adulthood and marriage. The phrase 'great way off' is a stock description for a distant kingdom. The sentence structure is a compound-complex sentence, detailing cause ('grew up', 'time drew near') and effect ('got ready to set off'). Active voice and clear sequence of events.",
      "Moral Implication": "Marriage is presented as a natural and expected stage in a princess's life, a transition into a new role and responsibilities. The journey to the prince signifies a rite of passage. It implies that maturation involves leaving the familiar and venturing into the unknown.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Growing up and betrothal symbolize the Ego's readiness for separation from the maternal environment and the call to unite with the 'other' (Animus for a female protagonist, or the external world demanding engagement). The journey 'a great way off' represents the process of individuation, a venture into the unconscious or the wider world to achieve greater wholeness and maturity. The betrothal signifies a destined union, often representing the union of opposites within the psyche.",
      "Sentence": "When she grew up, she was betrothed to a prince who lived a great way off; and as the time drew near for her to be married, she got ready to set off on her journey to his country.",

      "Plot Function": "Details the preparations for the princess's journey, emphasizing her royal status and the wealth of her kingdom. It showcases the mother's care and the societal expectations for a royal bride. These items also serve as symbols of her identity which she will later be stripped of.",
      "Grimm Style": "Use of lists ('jewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine dresses') to convey abundance, a common Grimm technique. The phrase 'everything that became a royal bride' is a typical, somewhat formal expression. Concrete nouns dominate. Matter-of-fact tone describing lavish preparations.",
      "Moral Implication": "Illustrates parental providence and the appropriate bestowing of dowry for a princess. The costliness of the items reflects her high status. It subtly contrasts with the impending loss and hardship, making her later suffering more poignant.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'costly things' symbolize the princess's inherited gifts, talents, status, and identity – the established 'persona' she carries from her protected upbringing. These are external markers of her self. The journey will test whether her true worth lies in these external trappings or in her inner qualities. Packing these items is akin to the Ego equipping itself with known attributes before facing the unknown.",
      "Sentence": "Then the queen her mother, packed up a great many costly things; jewels, and gold, and silver; trinkets, fine dresses, and in short everything that became a royal bride.",

      "Grimm Style": "Introduction of an archetypal supporting character, the 'waiting-maid'. Simple sentence structure describing the practical arrangements for the journey. 'Give her into the bridegroom’s hands' is a somewhat archaic and formal phrasing for entrusting someone.",
      "Moral Implication": "Highlights the reliance of royalty on servants and the trust placed in them. The maid's intended role is one of duty and loyalty, which will be betrayed, thus emphasizing the moral implications of such betrayal.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'waiting-maid' can represent the Shadow aspect of the princess or a less developed, potentially envious part of the psyche. Initially appearing as a helper, she will become the antagonist who usurps the princess's identity. This foreshadows an internal conflict or the emergence of repressed negative traits. The 'horse for the journey' symbolizes the means of progression or the vital energy for the individuation journey.",
      "Sentence": "And she gave her a waiting-maid to ride with her, and give her into the bridegroomâ€™s hands; and each had a horse for the journey.",

    {
      "Plot Function": "Introduces Falada, a magical element crucial to the plot. Falada's ability to speak and his origin as a fairy's gift mark him as a special protector and a source of truth. This is a key magical item/helper.",
      "Grimm Style": "Introduction of a magical animal helper ('Falada'), a common motif. His ability to speak is stated directly and factually, typical of how magic is presented. Naming of the horse gives it significance. 'Fairy's gift' links him to the benevolent supernatural forces.",
      "Moral Implication": "Falada represents loyalty and truth. His magical nature suggests that truth has a voice, even if it is later suppressed. The fairy's gift implies that the princess is endowed with powerful, albeit vulnerable, protective forces.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Falada, the speaking horse, symbolizes intuition, instinct, or the voice of the unconscious that speaks truth. As a 'fairy's gift,' he represents a deep, almost magical connection to this inner wisdom. His name, Falada, might hint at 'fall' or 'fate,' foreshadowing his role in the princess's trials and ultimate vindication. He is a psychopomp figure, guiding and protecting the soul on its journey.",

      "Plot Function": "Describes the fairy's parting gift to the princess – a lock of hair imbued with magical protective properties. This act provides the princess with a tangible charm for her journey and sets up a crucial plot device that will be lost, leading to her vulnerability. The dialogue reinforces the charm's importance.",
      "Grimm Style": "Magical intervention by the 'fairy' (Helper/Donor archetype). The 'lock of hair' is a specific, symbolic magical item. The fairy's speech is direct and instructive ('Take care of it... it is a charm'). The act of cutting hair has ritualistic undertones. Simple action sequence: 'took a little knife, and cut off a lock... and gave it... and said'.",
      "Moral Implication": "Emphasizes the protective power of maternal/supernatural love, symbolized by the hair. The instruction 'Take care of it' highlights the responsibility of the recipient to safeguard such gifts. The potential usefulness 'on the road' underscores that journeys are fraught with need for protection.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The lock of hair, given by the fairy (representing the good mother/wise woman), is a potent symbol of connection to origin, innate strength, or a protective blessing from the unconscious. Hair often symbolizes vitality, power, or identity. This charm is like an inner resource or a guiding principle given to the Ego as it embarks on its journey. Losing it will signify a loss of this initial protection and a descent into greater trial.",
      "Sentence": "When the time came for them to set out, the fairy went into her bed-chamber, and took a little knife, and cut off a lock of her hair, and gave it to the princess, and said, â€˜Take care of it, dear child; for it is a charm that may be of use to you on the road.â€™",

      "Plot Function": "Marks the princess's departure and the beginning of her journey. The 'sorrowful leave' emphasizes the emotional weight of this transition. Her action of securing the charm shows initial obedience and awareness of its value.",
      "Grimm Style": "Direct statement of emotion ('sorrowful leave'). Simple sequence of actions ('put the lock... got upon her horse, and set off'). The journey motif is central. Use of 'bosom' is a slightly archaic term for where one keeps precious items close.",
      "Moral Implication": "The sorrow of parting highlights the pain inherent in separation and growth. The princess's initial care for the charm suggests her good intentions, making its later loss more tragic. The journey to the 'bridegroom's kingdom' reinforces the societal expectation and the princess's path.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'sorrowful leave' signifies the necessary pain of separating from the primary maternal bond and the familiar world (the first stage of the individuation journey – separation). Placing the lock of hair (the protective charm/inner strength) in her 'bosom' (close to the heart) indicates its importance to her emerging identity. Setting off on the journey represents the Ego's active engagement with the path towards maturity and union.",

      "Plot Function": "Introduces the first test/trial on the journey. The princess's thirst creates a need, and her request to the maid sets up the initial conflict and the maid's insubordination. The 'golden cup' is a symbol of her status.",
      "Grimm Style": "A common trial scenario: thirst on a journey. Direct dialogue is used to advance the plot. 'Pray get down' is a polite, slightly archaic request. The 'golden cup' is an ordinary but important item signifying royalty. 'Yonder brook' is a typical simple description.",
      "Moral Implication": "The princess's polite request is contrasted with the maid's impending rudeness. This situation tests the established hierarchy and the maid's loyalty. The princess's natural need (thirst) leads to a social confrontation.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Thirst symbolizes a natural need or longing of the Ego. The 'brook' represents a source of sustenance or a minor threshold. The request to the maid is a test of the relationship and the power dynamic. The 'golden cup' symbolizes her royal identity and self-worth, which she is about to be challenged on. This is the first subtle challenge to her established persona and authority.",
      "Sentence": "One day, as they were riding along by a brook, the princess began to feel very thirsty: and she said to her maid, â€˜Pray get down, and fetch me some water in my golden cup out of yonder brook, for I want to drink.â€™",

      "Plot Function": "The waiting-maid explicitly rebels, refusing to serve the princess. This is the first overt act of insubordination and a turning point in their relationship. The maid declares her intention to shed her subservient role.",
      "Grimm Style": "Direct, defiant speech from the maid. 'Nay' is an archaic term of refusal. The maid's declaration is blunt and challenges the social order ('I shall not be your waiting-maid any longer'). Simple, impactful dialogue drives the conflict.",
      "Moral Implication": "This sentence starkly portrays betrayal and the breaking of societal roles. The maid's words are a direct affront to her duty and to the princess's status. It highlights the theme of envy or ambition leading to rebellion.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The maid's rebellion signifies the emergence of the Shadow aspect, which refuses to remain subservient to the Ego (princess). It's a challenge from a previously suppressed part of the psyche or an external force aiming to usurp the Ego's rightful place. This is the beginning of the princess's power being undermined, a necessary step in her journey towards finding her true, inner strength rather than relying on external status.",
      "Sentence": "â€˜Nay,â€™ said the maid, â€˜if you are thirsty, get off yourself, and stoop down by the water and drink; I shall not be your waiting-maid any longer.â€™",

    {
      "Plot Function": "Shows the princess's reaction to the maid's rebellion: she submits due to thirst and fear. Her inability to use her golden cup and her weeping signify her diminishing power and rising distress. Her question voices her despair.",
      "Grimm Style": "Direct statement of the princess's internal state ('so thirsty', 'frightened') and actions ('got down', 'knelt', 'drank', 'wept'). Her exclamation 'Alas! what will become of me?' is a classic expression of distress. The golden cup, a symbol of her status, is unused, showing her loss of authority.",
      "Moral Implication": "Illustrates the princess's meekness and perhaps a lack of assertiveness in the face of blatant disrespect. Her fear prevents her from asserting her status. This highlights the vulnerability of gentleness when confronted by aggression. Her suffering begins here.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The princess's submission to drinking directly from the brook, without her cup, symbolizes a humbling experience and a forced relinquishing of her royal persona. Her fear and weeping indicate the Ego's distress when its established supports begin to crumble. 'Alas! what will become of me?' is the Ego's cry when faced with the loss of its known identity and the rise of threatening forces (the Shadow/rebellious maid). This is a descent into a state of powerlessness.",

      "Moral Implication": "The charm's response suggests that the protection endowed by love (mother/fairy) is still active, even if the princess is unaware or unable to fully utilize it. It provides a glimmer of hope amidst her despair.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The lock of hair answering represents a voice from the unconscious, an inner resource, or the echo of the protective maternal/fairy influence. It's a sign that even when the Ego feels overwhelmed and its external status is challenged, deeper psychic supports may still be present. This is the first manifestation of the charm's power.",

      "Moral Implication": "The couplet emphasizes the bond between mother and daughter and the pain that betrayal or suffering can cause to loved ones. It acts as a lament for the princess's situation and perhaps a subtle admonishment for her current powerlessness or the broken social order.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The lock of hair (symbol of innate strength/maternal protection) speaks a truth reflecting the princess's inner state and the disruption of her world. 'If thy mother knew it' points to the current disconnect from her source of origin and protection. The sorrowful tone mirrors the Ego's distress and the 'rueing' suggests the severe consequences of this unfolding betrayal and loss of identity.

      "Moral Implication": "This reinforces the moral weight of the maid's betrayal and the princess's suffering by invoking the deep emotional impact it would have on a loving parent. It underscores the value of the mother-daughter bond and the pain caused by its disruption.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The completed message from the lock of hair (the inner protective principle) confirms the grave nature of the Ego's (princess's) predicament. The 'sadly, sadly, would she rue it' emphasizes the profound sorrow and negative repercussions stemming from the Ego's loss of power and the Shadow's (maid's) ascendancy.

      "Grimm Style": "Direct character description using simple adjectives ('gentle and meek'). Her passivity ('said nothing') is stated clearly. This sentence highlights a key trait that contributes to her victimhood in the early stages of the story. Simple compound sentence.",
      "Moral Implication": "While gentleness and meekness can be virtues, here they are shown as vulnerabilities when faced with aggression. The princess's passivity allows evil to take root. This might subtly question extreme passivity, as it leads to her suffering. However, in many Grimm tales, such initial meekness is later vindicated, suggesting it's a trial of patience.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The princess's 'gentle and meek' nature represents an Ego that is perhaps underdeveloped in its assertive or defensive capabilities, possibly overly reliant on external protection. Her saying 'nothing to her maid's ill behaviour' shows a failure to confront the rising Shadow aspect. This passivity leads to further encroachment by the Shadow, a common theme in the process of confronting and integrating it; sometimes the Ego must be overwhelmed before it can find new strength.",

The 'scorching sun' is a concrete detail explaining the thirst. Her forgetting the 'rude speech' highlights her gentle nature.",
      "Moral Implication": "The princess's recurring thirst and her forgetting the maid's rudeness could be seen as innocence or perhaps a lack of necessary caution. It implies that trials often repeat until a lesson is learned or a change occurs. The escalating heat symbolizes increasing hardship.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The continued journey under a 'scorching sun' represents the increasing intensity of the trials in the individuation process. The recurring thirst signifies a persistent need or longing. Forgetting the maid's rudeness suggests the Ego's tendency to revert to its established patterns of politeness or perhaps a difficulty in recognizing and holding onto the reality of the Shadow's antagonism. This sets up a repeated test of her resilience and the power dynamic.",

Her speech is short, dismissive, and reinforces her rebellion ('Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid'). This repetition with variation (increased haughtiness) is a common Grimm narrative device.",
      "Moral Implication": "Illustrates how unchecked aggression and disrespect can escalate. The maid's increased haughtiness is a direct consequence of the princess's previous passivity. It teaches that failing to address wrongdoing can embolden the wrongdoer.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The maid's (Shadow's) increased haughtiness and solidified rebellion signify the Shadow gaining more power and control over the Ego (princess).

This highlights a critical stage where the Shadow is no longer just challenging but actively dominating, forcing the Ego into a more profound state of submission.",

      "Moral Implication": "The charm's repeated response reinforces the idea that protective forces are still aware of her suffering.

      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The complete, repeated lament from the lock of hair (inner wisdom) serves as a final echo of the original protective state before a significant loss. It underscores the Ego's (princess's) current state of helplessness and the profound psychic distress this causes, as if the very core of her being mourns the situation before a deeper trial ensues with the loss of this symbolic connection.",

      "Grimm Style": "A pivotal plot event delivered in a simple, declarative manner. The 'lock of hair fell from her bosom, and floated away with the water' is a clear, almost visual description of the loss. Cause and effect: leaning down causes the loss. Water as an element of transition or loss.",
      "Moral Implication": "The loss of the charm due to her action (leaning down to drink, albeit driven by need) can be seen as a consequence of her vulnerability or a moment of fated misfortune. It highlights the fragility of magical protection if not diligently guarded, or perhaps the necessity of losing external aids to discover internal strength.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Losing the lock of hair symbolizes the loss of a primary connection to the maternal/protective unconscious, a severing from her initial source of strength or guidance. It signifies the Ego (princess) being stripped of its last external magical aid, forcing it into a deeper state of isolation and reliance on its own undeveloped resources. Floating 'away with the water' suggests being carried away by the flow of events or into the depths of the unconscious, a necessary descent for transformation.",

      "Moral Implication": "The princess's lack of awareness at a critical moment shows her vulnerability. The maid's gladness at the princess's misfortune is a stark depiction of her evil nature and manipulative intent. It underscores how villains exploit moments of weakness or ignorance.",
      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The princess (Ego) being unaware of the loss of her protective charm (inner connection) while the maid (Shadow) sees and rejoices highlights the Shadow's cunning and its ability to capitalize on the Ego's vulnerabilities or moments of unconsciousness. The Shadow 'knowing the charm' suggests it understands the sources of the Ego's strength and how to undermine them. The bride being 'in her power' signifies the Ego falling under the domination of the Shadow.",

The exchange of clothes (royal for shabby) is a classic motif of status reversal and disguise (Hidden Identity archetype). Sequence of actions clearly stated.",

      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The maid (Shadow) taking Falada (intuition/truth) and the royal clothes (persona/identity) signifies the Shadow's complete usurpation of the Ego's rightful place and attributes. The princess (Ego) being forced into 'shabby ones' and riding the inferior horse represents her demotion, loss of external identity, and descent into a lower, more humbled state. This is a necessary stage of stripping away the false or superficial self to eventually uncover the true Self.",
      "Sentence": "So when the bride had done drinking, and would have got upon Falada again, the maid said, â€˜I shall ride upon Falada, and you may have my horse insteadâ€™; so she was forced to give up her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her maidâ€™s shabby ones.",

      "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Arrival at the 'royal court' (symbolizing a place of judgment, potential integration, or societal recognition) with the Shadow (maid) in the Ego's (princess's) rightful place represents a critical point. The Ego is in its most debased state, while the Shadow enjoys undeserved recognition. This is a test of whether the external world will recognize the true Self or be deceived by the Persona/Shadow.",

      "Then all rode farther on their journey, till the day grew so warm, and the sun so scorching, that the bride began to feel very thirsty again; and at last, when they came to a river, she forgot her maidâ€™s rude speech, and said, â€˜Pray get down, and fetch me some water to drink in my golden cup.â€™ But the maid answered her, and even spoke more haughtily than before: â€˜Drink if you will, but I shall not be your waiting-maid.â€™ Then the princess was so thirsty that she got off her horse, and lay down, and held her head over the running stream, and cried and said, â€˜What will become of me?â€™ And the lock of hair answered her again:",
      " â€˜Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,",
      "  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.â€™",
      "And as she leaned down to drink, the lock of hair fell from her bosom, and floated away with the water. Now she was so frightened that she did not see it; but her maid saw it, and was very glad, for she knew the charm; and she saw that the poor bride would be in her power, now that she had lost the hair. So when the bride had done drinking, and would have got upon Falada again, the maid said, â€˜I shall ride upon Falada, and you may have my horse insteadâ€™; so she was forced to give up her horse, and soon afterwards to take off her royal clothes and put on her maidâ€™s shabby ones.",
      "At last, as they drew near the end of their journey, this treacherous servant threatened to kill her mistress if she ever told anyone what had happened. But Falada saw it all, and marked it well.",
      "Then the waiting-maid got upon Falada, and the real bride rode upon the other horse, and they went on in this way till at last they came to the royal court. There was great joy at their coming, and the prince flew to meet them, and lifted the maid from her horse, thinking she was the one who was to be his wife; and she was led upstairs to the royal chamber; but the true princess was told to stay in the court below.",
      "Now the old king happened just then to have nothing else to do; so he amused himself by sitting at his kitchen window, looking at what was going on; and he saw her in the courtyard. As she looked very pretty, and too delicate for a waiting-maid, he went up into the royal chamber to ask the bride who it was she had brought with her, that was thus left standing in the court below. â€˜I brought her with me for the sake of her company on the road,â€™ said she; â€˜pray give the girl some work to do, that she may not be idle.â€™ The old king could not for some time think of any work for her to do; but at last he said, â€˜I have a lad who takes care of my geese; she may go and help him.â€™ Now the name of this lad, that the real bride was to help in watching the kingâ€™s geese, was Curdken.",
      "But the false bride said to the prince, â€˜Dear husband, pray do me one piece of kindness.â€™ â€˜That I will,â€™ said the prince. â€˜Then tell one of your slaughterers to cut off the head of the horse I rode upon, for it was very unruly, and plagued me sadly on the roadâ€™; but the truth was, she was very much afraid lest Falada should some day or other speak, and tell all she had done to the princess. She carried her point, and the faithful Falada was killed; but when the true princess heard of it, she wept, and begged the man to nail up Faladaâ€™s head against a large dark gate of the city, through which she had to pass every morning and evening, that there she might still see him sometimes. Then the slaughterer said he would do as she wished; and cut off the head, and nailed it up under the dark gate.",
      "Early the next morning, as she and Curdken went out through the gate, she said sorrowfully:",
      " â€˜Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!â€™",
      "and the head answered:",
      " â€˜Bride, bride, there thou gangest!",
      "  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,",
      "  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.â€™",
      "Then they went out of the city, and drove the geese on. And when she came to the meadow, she sat down upon a bank there, and let down her waving locks of hair, which were all of pure silver; and when Curdken saw it glitter in the sun, he ran up, and would have pulled some of the locks out, but she cried:",
      " â€˜Blow, breezes, blow! / Let Curdkenâ€™s hat go! / Blow, breezes, blow! / Let him after it go! / Oâ€™er hills, dales, and rocks, / Away be it whirlâ€™d / Till the silvery locks / Are all combâ€™d and curlâ€™d!",
      "Then there came a wind, so strong that it blew off Curdkenâ€™s hat; and away it flew over the hills: and he was forced to turn and run after it; till, by the time he came back, she had done combing and curling her hair, and had put it up again safe. Then he was very angry and sulky, and would not speak to her at all; but they watched the geese until it grew dark in the evening, and then drove them homewards.",
      "The next morning, as they were going through the dark gate, the poor girl looked up at Faladaâ€™s head, and cried:",
      " â€˜Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!â€™",
      "and the head answered:",
      " â€˜Bride, bride, there thou gangest!",
      "  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,",
      "  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.â€™",
      "Then she drove on the geese, and sat down again in the meadow, and began to comb out her hair as before; and Curdken ran up to her, and wanted to take hold of it; but she cried out quickly:",
      " â€˜Blow, breezes, blow! / Let Curdkenâ€™s hat go! / Blow, breezes, blow! / Let him after it go! / Oâ€™er hills, dales, and rocks, / Away be it whirlâ€™d / Till the silvery locks / Are all combâ€™d and curlâ€™d!",
      "Then the wind came and blew away his hat; and off it flew a great way, over the hills and far away, so that he had to run after it; and when he came back she had bound up her hair again, and all was safe. So they watched the geese till it grew dark.",
      "In the evening, after they came home, Curdken went to the old king, and said, â€˜I cannot have that strange girl to help me to keep the geese any longer.â€™ â€˜Why?â€™ said the king. â€˜Because, instead of doing any good, she does nothing but tease me all day long.â€™ Then the king made him tell him what had happened. And Curdken said, â€˜When we go in the morning through the dark gate with our flock of geese, she cries and talks with the head of a horse that hangs upon the wall, and says:",
      " â€˜Falada, Falada, there thou hangest!â€™",
      "and the head answers:",
      " â€˜Bride, bride, there thou gangest!",
      "  Alas! alas! if thy mother knew it,",
      "  Sadly, sadly, would she rue it.â€™",
      "And Curdken went on telling the king what had happened upon the meadow where the geese fed; how his hat was blown away; and how he was forced to run after it, and to leave his flock of geese to themselves. But the old king told the boy to go out again the next day: and when morning came, he placed himself behind the dark gate, and heard how she spoke to Falada, and how Falada answered. Then he went into the field, and hid himself in a bush by the meadowâ€™s side; and he soon saw with his own eyes how they drove the flock of geese; and how, after a little time, she let down her hair that glittered in the sun. And then he heard her say:",
      " â€˜Blow, breezes, blow! / Let Curdkenâ€™s hat go! / Blow, breezes, blow! / Let him after it go! / Oâ€™er hills, dales, and rocks, / Away be it whirlâ€™d / Till the silvery locks / Are all combâ€™d and curlâ€™d!",
      "And soon came a gale of wind, and carried away Curdkenâ€™s hat, and away went Curdken after it, while the girl went on combing and curling her hair. All this the old king saw: so he went home without being seen; and when the little goose-girl came back in the evening he called her aside, and asked her why she did so: but she burst into tears, and said, â€˜That I must not tell you or any man, or I shall lose my life.â€™",
      "But the old king begged so hard, that she had no peace till she had told him all the tale, from beginning to end, word for word. And it was very lucky for her that she did so, for when she had done the king ordered royal clothes to be put upon her, and gazed on her with wonder, she was so beautiful. Then he called his son and told him that he had only a false bride; for that she was merely a waiting-maid, while the true bride stood by. And the young king rejoiced when he saw her beauty, and heard how meek and patient she had been; and without saying anything to the false bride, the king ordered a great feast to be got ready for all his court. The bridegroom sat at the top, with the false princess on one side, and the true one on the other; but nobody knew her again, for her beauty was quite dazzling to their eyes; and she did not seem at all like the little goose-girl, now that she had her brilliant dress on.",
      "When they had eaten and drank, and were very merry, the old king said he would tell them a tale. So he began, and told all the story of the princess, as if it was one that he had once heard; and he asked the true waiting-maid what she thought ought to be done to anyone who would behave thus. â€˜Nothing better,â€™ said this false bride, â€˜than that she should be thrown into a cask stuck round with sharp nails, and that two white horses should be put to it, and should drag it from street to street till she was dead.â€™ â€˜Thou art she!â€™ said the old king; â€˜and as thou has judged thyself, so shall it be done to thee.â€™ And the young king was then married to his true wife, and they reigned over the kingdom in peace and happiness all their lives; and the good fairy came to see them, and restored the faithful Falada to life again."
