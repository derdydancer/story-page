**Authors Guide to Replicating Grimms’ Fairy Tales (1st Edition)**

**Purpose:** A complete reference for modern authors seeking to reproduce and create new works in the exact tradition of the Brothers Grimm, based on the style, structure, and content observed in their collected tales.

**Scope:** This guide is informed exclusively by the analysis of the provided text collection of Grimms' Fairy Tales. It aims to capture the patterns, language, and narrative conventions present within these specific stories.

---

**Part 1: Language**

The language of the Grimm tales (in this translation) is distinct: direct, simple, yet possessing an archaic flavour.

*   **Vocabulary:** Predominantly uses common, concrete words. Nouns and verbs drive the action. Adjectives are functional (beautiful, poor, old, golden, little, great, wicked, faithful) rather than deeply descriptive or evocative in a modern sense. Archaic but understandable terms appear occasionally ("prithee," "nay," "alas," "whither," "hark ye," "dwelt," "betook," "naught"). Avoid complex, abstract, scientific, or modern vocabulary.
*   **Sentence Structure:** Primarily simple and compound sentences. Clauses are frequently linked with "and," "but," "so," "then." Complex sentence structures with multiple subordinate clauses are rare. Sentences often follow a Subject-Verb-Object pattern. Active voice is heavily preferred.
    *   *Example:* "The king became very angry at this, and ordered the gardener to keep watch all night under the tree." (Simple compound sentence)
    *   *Example:* "She sat down in one corner of the room, and began to bewail her hard fate; when on a sudden the door opened, and a droll-looking little man hobbled in..." (Compound sentence with a 'when' clause)
*   **Tone:** Matter-of-fact, declarative, and unadorned. Events, even magical or gruesome ones, are often reported with little explicit emotional colouring from the narrator. There's a lack of irony, overt sentimentality, or deep psychological exploration. The narrator is omniscient but rarely intrusive or interpretive.

---

**Part 2: Poetic Structures**

While prose dominates, moments of poetic structure break the narrative, often signifying magic, important pronouncements, or recurring actions.

*   **Rhyming Couplets/Quatrains:** Used for spells, messages from magical objects, or significant cries. These are simple, often AABB or ABCB rhymes.
    *   *Example (Ashputtel):* "Shake, shake, hazel-tree, / Gold and silver over me!"
    *   *Example (The Frog-Prince):* "Open the door, my princess dear, / Open the door to thy true love here! / And mind the words that thou and I said / By the fountain cool, in the greenwood shade."
    *   *Example (The Raven):* "Caw! Caw! well I ween / Mortal lips have this way been."
*   **Repetitive Phrases/Songs:** Characters or magical elements often repeat specific phrases or short songs, creating a ritualistic feel and reinforcing key plot points.
    *   *Example (Rumpelstiltskin's Song):* "Merrily the feast I’ll make..."
    *   *Example (Goose-Girl):* Falada's repeated warning.
    *   *Example (Snowdrop):* The Queen's interaction with the mirror.
*   **Incantatory Rhythm:** The simplicity of the prose and the repetition of sentence structures ("Then he/she said," "Then he/she went") can create a rhythmic, almost chant-like quality in places.

---

**Part 3: Story Structures**

Grimm's tales often follow recognisable narrative patterns, frequently combining several structures within a single story:

*   **The Linear Quest:** A protagonist sets out to find something (Golden Bird, Water of Life, Rumpelstiltskin's name) or someone (lost brothers, kidnapped princess). The journey involves overcoming obstacles, often with magical help. (e.g., The Golden Bird, The Water of Life, The Seven Ravens, The Queen Bee).

*   **The Trial/Task Structure:** Protagonists must perform specific tasks, often in threes (three nights of watching, three impossible tasks, three questions). Success brings reward; failure often means death or enchantment. These tasks often test virtue (kindness, obedience) or skill. (e.g., The Golden Bird, Ashputtel, The Twelve Dancing Princesses, The Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was, Iron Hans, The White Snake, Mother Holle).

*   **Transformation and Restoration:** Characters are changed (into animals, stone, objects, or social states like poverty/royalty) due to curses, enchantments, or misfortune. Restoration often occurs through specific actions (kiss, breaking a spell object, fulfilling a condition), acts of love, faithfulness, or external magical intervention. (e.g., The Frog-Prince, The Raven, Lily and the Lion, Snowdrop, The Juniper-Tree [boy to bird to boy], The Salad [donkey transformation], Iron Hans [wild man]).

*   **Punishment and Reward:** Actions have direct, often stark, and frequently supernatural consequences. Kindness, humility, cleverness, piety, and keeping promises are frequently rewarded (often with marriage, wealth, or kingdom). Pride, greed, cruelty, envy, laziness, and breaking taboos are punished, often brutally and fittingly (e.g., being torn apart, burned, drowned, turned to stone, left in original squalor). (e.g., The Fisherman and His Wife, Mother Holle, Ashputtel's stepsisters, The Goose-Girl's maid, The Dog and the Sparrow, Cat and Mouse in Partnership, King Grisly-Beard).

*   **Cause and Effect (Often Magical/Immediate):** Simple actions, words, or omissions trigger significant, often immediate, magical events. Breaking a promise (Frog-Prince), disobeying advice (Golden Bird), showing kindness (Miser in the Bush's wishes, Queen Bee's helpers), uttering a rash wish (Seven Ravens), or interacting with a magical object/being sets the plot in motion. (e.g., The Golden Bird, The Frog-Prince, Briar Rose, The Juniper Tree, The Raven, The Blue Light).

*   **Cyclical Structure/Repetition with Variation:** Some stories involve repeated actions, journeys, or trials, often with slight variations or escalations. This includes patterns of three attempts, three nights, or recurring encounters. (e.g., Ashputtel attending the ball three times, The Youth watching the castle three nights, Snowdrop's stepmother's three attempts, The Raven's helper failing three times, The Golden Bird's brothers failing sequentially).

*   **Episodic Journey/Picaresque:** The narrative follows a protagonist through a series of relatively self-contained adventures or encounters, rather than a single, overarching quest. The focus is often on the character's nature (luck, foolishness, cleverness) revealed through these episodes. (e.g., Hans in Luck, Tom Thumb, The Valiant Little Tailor, The Little Peasant, Clever Hans, Frederick and Catherine).

*   **Grateful Animals/Supernatural Helpers:** A common structure where the protagonist shows kindness to animals or humble beings (ants, ducks, bees, fox, birds, dwarfs) who later provide crucial aid in overcoming obstacles or fulfilling tasks. This often contrasts with unkind siblings/characters who fail. (e.g., The White Snake, The Queen Bee, The Golden Bird, Ashputtel, Old Sultan, Iron Hans).

*   **The Trickster Outwits the Powerful/Foolish:** The protagonist, often from a lower social standing or perceived as simple, uses cunning, wit, and deception to overcome stronger, richer, or more foolish adversaries, often gaining wealth or status. (e.g., The Valiant Little Tailor, The Little Peasant, The Miser in the Bush, Clever Gretel, Doctor Knowall, The Fox and the Horse).

*   **Hidden Identity/Revelation:** The protagonist's true identity or nature is concealed (often through disguise, enchantment, or lowly status) and revealed at a climactic moment, leading to recognition, reward, or marriage. (e.g., The Goose-Girl [princess as goose-girl], Ashputtel [at the ball], Cat-Skin [princess as scullion], Iron Hans [prince as gardener's boy], King Grisly-Beard [king as fiddler/beggar], The Twelve Huntsmen [princesses as huntsmen]).

*   **The Simpleton Succeeds:** Often the youngest or most overlooked character, deemed foolish or simple ('Dummling'), ultimately triumphs over their apparently cleverer or stronger siblings/rivals through inherent goodness, kindness to others (especially nature/magic beings), or simply good fortune. (e.g., The Golden Bird, The Queen Bee, The Golden Goose, The Water of Life, Three Languages).

*   **Escalating Greed/Desire Leads to Ruin:** A narrative focused on a character whose insatiable desires grow with each fulfillment, ultimately leading to their downfall and often a return to their original (or worse) state. (e.g., The Fisherman and His Wife, Cat and Mouse in Partnership [the cat's greed]).

*   **Broken Taboo/Promise as Catalyst:** The core conflict arises directly from the violation of a specific prohibition, rule, or promise, unleashing negative consequences or initiating a quest for restoration. (e.g., Briar Rose [spindle], The Frog-Prince [initial refusal], Lily and the Lion [ray of light], Iron Hans [polluting the well], The Blue Light [trying to take the light prematurely], Rapunzel [revealing the prince's visits]).

*   **Fable/Didactic Cautionary Tale:** Shorter narratives, often featuring personified animals or objects, designed to illustrate a specific moral lesson about behaviour, character flaws, or the ways of the world, often ending with stark consequences. (e.g., The Straw, the Coal, and the Bean; Cat and Mouse in Partnership; The Fox and the Cat; The Mouse, the Bird, and the Sausage; The Old Man and his Grandson; The Wolf and the Seven Little Kids).

*   **Rescue from Enchantment/Imprisonment:** The central plot revolves around freeing oneself or, more commonly, a loved one from a magical curse, transformation, or physical imprisonment imposed by a malevolent force (witch, enchanter, curse). (e.g., Jorinda and Jorindel, Rapunzel, The Raven, Lily and the Lion, Snowdrop [from poisoned sleep], Sweetheart Roland).

*   **Justice/Revenge Cycle:** Stories where the plot is primarily driven by the need to enact justice or revenge for a wrong suffered, often involving escalating acts of retribution or a quest to expose and punish the wrongdoer. (e.g., The Dog and the Sparrow, The Juniper-Tree [bird's song and actions], The Miser in the Bush [using the fiddle], The Blue Light [soldier's revenge], The Robber Bridegroom [revelation and execution]).

*   **The Cumulative Burden/Accretion (Subtle Structure):** A less common structure where the plot builds through the physical accumulation of elements – people sticking together, objects placed strategically – leading to a comedic or chaotic climax. (e.g., The Golden Goose [characters sticking], The Adventures of Chanticleer and Partlet [Korbes story, items accumulating in the house]).

*   **The Accidental Hero/Success Through Misunderstanding (Subtle Structure):** Characters achieve heroic outcomes or success not through intent or skill, but through bumbling, misunderstanding, or unintended consequences of their actions which frighten or deceive opponents. (e.g., The Travelling Musicians [scaring robbers], Frederick and Catherine [door defeats thieves], Doctor Knowall [accidental guesses interpreted as knowledge]).

*   **Inversion of Expectations (Subtle Structure):** The narrative sets up a familiar fairy-tale trope or goal but subverts the expected outcome or method of achievement. (e.g., The Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was [learns mundanely], Hans in Luck [finds happiness in loss], The Travelling Musicians [find domesticity not fame]).

*   **Power of Naming/True Identity Knowledge (Motif as Structure):** While part of revelation plots, the specific act of knowing or speaking a true name holds inherent magical power or is the key to defeating an antagonist or breaking a spell. (e.g., Rumpelstiltskin, often crucial in recognition scenes like The Goose-Girl or Iron Hans where knowing *who* someone truly is changes everything).

    *   *Psychological Analogue:* Represents the **Ego** undergoing the process of **Individuation**. The journey symbolizes the challenges of development, confronting internal and external obstacles to achieve self-realization, maturity, or integration. Often starts in a state of lack or naïveté.

3.  **Helper/Donor:** Provides the Hero with crucial aid, advice, or magical objects.
    *   *Examples:* Fox (*Golden Bird*), Birds (*Ashputtel*), Dwarf (*Rumpelstiltskin*, *Miser in Bush*), Old Women (*Twelve Dancing Princesses*, *The Salad*), Animals (*Queen Bee*, *White Snake*, *Old Sultan*), Iron Hans.
    *   *Psychological Analogue:* Represents unexpected aid from the **Unconscious**. This could be intuition, instinct (animals), hidden wisdom (old figures), synchronicity, or the emergence of helpful inner figures like the **Anima/Animus** (if opposite gender to the hero) or the **Wise Old Man/Woman**. Often requires an act of kindness or recognition from the Hero to activate.

17. **The Threshold Guardian:**  Figures or challenges testing the hero's readiness.
    *   *Examples:* Dwarf (*Water of Life*), Giants (*Valiant Little Tailor*, *The Raven*), Lions (*Water of Life*), Tasks set by Taskmasters, needing specific instructions (*Golden Bird*).

    *   *Psychological Analogue:* Represents **process, stages of development, and completion**. Often follows a pattern of thesis-antithesis-synthesis, requiring multiple attempts before integration or resolution is achieved. It builds narrative tension and emphasizes the significance of the final element.

28. **The Broken Prohibition/Taboo:** A specific rule is given ("don't open the door," "don't look back," "don't eat this," "don't say my name") which is inevitably broken, triggering consequences.
    *   *Examples:* Rumpelstiltskin (naming), Bluebeard analogue (opening forbidden door - though not in these specific tales, it's a common fairytale archetype related), Wife in *The Raven* (rash wish), potentially Elsie forgetting the pick-axe.
    *   *Psychological Analogue:* Represents the **limits of conscious control** over unconscious impulses or curiosity (Id). It can symbolize the necessary "fall" into knowledge or experience, the transition from innocence to awareness, often at a cost. It highlights the power inherent in names and secrets.

29. **Restoration of Order/Justice:** The narrative culminates in the punishment of the wicked and the reward/restoration of the virtuous, bringing balance back to the world.
    *   *Examples:* Endings of *Ashputtel*, *Snowdrop*, *Hansel and Gretel*, *Goose-Girl*, *The Juniper-Tree*, *Valiant Little Tailor*, etc.
    *   *Psychological Analogue:* Represents the psyche's innate drive towards **balance and integration**. The punishment of the villain can symbolize the confrontation and assimilation of the Shadow, while the Hero's reward signifies the successful achievement of a new level of conscious integration (Individuation), often symbolized by marriage (union of opposites).

This more detailed breakdown attempts to capture the psychological depths resonating within these seemingly simple tales, showing how they reflect universal patterns of human experience and inner development.

**Choice of Words:**
*   **Do:** Lean towards simple, concrete language. Use words readily understood.
*   **Do:** Use functional adjectives (e.g., "old," "poor," "good," "shiny," "dark").
*   **Do:** In dialogue sprinkle in occasional archaic terms like "alas," "hark," "nigh," "dwelt," "prithee," "hark ye," "morrow," "hither," "thither," "aught," "naught," "beest," "betook."
*   **Do:** Use stock phrases like "as quick as lightning," "stone dead," "wide world," "heart's content," "day dawned," "many a time," "greatly rejoiced," "wept bitterly."
*   **Do:** Refer to characters generically (the youth, the maiden, the man, the wife, the king, the merchant, the beggar) when specific names aren't needed or given.
*   **Do:** Employ simple comparisons ("as white as snow," "shone like gold," "quiet as a mouse," "rose like mountains").
*   **Don't:** Use modern slang, jargon, technical terms, abstract concepts, or overly complex vocabulary (e.g., avoid "serendipitous," "infrastructure," "epiphany").
*   **Don't:** Use excessive or flowery adjectives (e.g., "the breathtakingly beautiful, scintillating princess"). Stick to simple descriptors.
*   **Don't:** Use sophisticated synonyms (e.g., use "sad" not "melancholy," "angry" not "irate," "beautiful" not "resplendent").
*   **Don't:** Use words that imply deep psychological states (e.g., "angst," "neurosis," "existential dread," "trauma").
*   **Don't:** Use overly technical terms even for trades (a tailor uses a "needle," not specific types; a captain has a "ship," not a specific vessel class).

**Sentence Structures:**
*   **Do:** Generally keep clauses relatively short and clear.
*   **Do:** Use simple sentences (one independent clause) and compound sentences (two or more independent clauses joined by a simple conjunction) predominantly.
*   **Do:** Link clauses mainly with simple conjunctions like "and," "but," "so," "or," "for," "then," or relative pronouns like "where," "who."
*   **Do:** Use active voice almost exclusively.
*   **Do:** Start sentences most frequently with "Then," "So," "And," "But," or the character's name/pronoun ("He," "She," "The youth").
*   **Do:** Employ parataxis (linking clauses with simple conjunctions rather than complex subordination).
*   **Do:** Frequently use reported speech introduced simply ("he said that...", "she told him to...").
*   **Do:** Occasionally use simple inversion for archaic flavour ("Then came the king...", "Down fell the penny...").
*   **Do:** Combine very short, consecutive sentences describing closely related actions to improve flow, often using "and" or "then" (e.g., "He picked it up and rubbed it hard" instead of "He picked it up. He rubbed it hard.").

*   **Don't:** Strive for complex sentence structures or excessive variety just for stylistic effect. Simplicity is key.
*   **Don't:** Use rhetorical questions frequently.

*   **Don't:** Dramatically vary sentence length purely for modern pacing effects. Maintain a generally consistent, flowing rhythm.
*   **Don't:** Embed dialogue within complex narrative sentences often. Keep narration and dialogue distinct.
*   **Don't:** Start too many consecutive sentences with the exact same word (especially pronouns like "He" or "She") if it creates an awkward, choppy effect. Use simple conjunctions or vary the sentence start slightly where needed for better rhythm, while staying simple.

**Beginning the Story:**
*   **Do:** Start with formulaic openings like "Once upon a time," "There was once a king/man/widow..." or similar simple framing ("Long, long ago...").
*   **Do:** Establish the initial situation or character simply and quickly.
*   **Do:** Immediately introduce the core problem or lack (poverty, a quest needed, childlessness).

*   **Do:** Use character names or simple pronouns ("He," "She," "They," "The king").
*   **Do:** Begin occasionally with simple prepositional phrases ("In the morning," "At last," "Near the forest").
*   **Don't:** Frequently use complex adverbial phrases or sophisticated transitional words (e.g., "Consequently," "Nevertheless," "Furthermore," "Subsequently").
*   **Don't:** Start sentences with "-ing" clauses (participle phrases) often; prefer simpler constructions.
*   **Don't:** Use abstract nouns as sentence subjects often (e.g., "His melancholy dictated his actions").

**Dialogue:**
*   **Do:** Keep dialogue direct and functional – it should advance the plot, state intentions, make requests, or reveal necessary information.
*   **Do:** Use simple tags like "said he," "answered she," "cried he," "thought the penny."
*   **Do:** Let characters state their intentions or feelings plainly ("I must go thither," "I am hungry," "How happy am I!").
*   **Do:** Have characters repeat instructions or important information clearly if needed.

*   **Don't:** Show hesitation through dialogue filler ("ums," "ahs") or fragmented sentences.
*   **Don't:** Have characters engage in abstract philosophical discussions.

**Describing Characters:**
*   **Do:** Describe characters briefly, focusing on archetypal traits (beautiful, ugly, old, young, rich, poor, clever, simple) or their role/profession (king, princess, soldier, miller, witch, dwarf). Use simple Anglo-Saxon or German names (Hans, Gretel, Wilhelm) or generic titles.
*   **Do:** Define characters primarily through their actions and direct speech.
*   **Do:** Introduce characters by their function or relationship (the stepmother, the youngest son, the old woman).

*   **Do:** Include archetypal magical helpers (fairies, helpful animals, enchanted objects) and villains (witches, cruel relatives, giants, dragons, robbers).
*   **Don't:** Provide detailed physical descriptions unless a specific feature is crucial to the plot (e.g., Snow White's colors, Rapunzel's hair length, Cinderella's foot size).
*   **Don't:** Use internal monologue, extensive backstory exposition, or psychological analysis.
*   **Don't:** Explore conflicting emotions or internal moral debates within a character.
*   **Don't:** Give characters complex histories or motivations beyond the immediate needs of the plot (why the witch is evil is less important than that she *is* evil).
*   **Don't:** Make characters morally ambiguous in their fundamental nature (good characters might make mistakes or be foolish, but their core alignment is usually clear).
*   **Don't:** Show gradual, internal character development; changes are usually sudden, often magical or resulting from completing a task.
*   **Don't:** Give characters modern-sounding fantasy names (Elara, Kael, Zayne).

**Describing Setting:**
*   **Do:** Use simple, archetypal locations: forest, castle, cottage, well, mountain, road, garden, mill, inn, sea.
*   **Do:** Describe them briefly and functionally ("a deep gloomy wood," "a shining palace," "a poor hut," "an old dry well").
*   **Do:** Mention specific, simple objects only if crucial to the plot (a spindle, a golden ball, an oven, a key, a net, a spool of thread).
*   **Do:** Contrast settings simply if needed (rich house vs. poor house, dark forest vs. bright clearing).
*   **Do:** Use generic terms like "a great city," "a certain kingdom," "a faraway land."
*   **Do:** Include functional details like locked doors, windows, stairs, wells, hearths, stables only if relevant to the action.
*   **Do:** Mention natural elements simply (sun, moon, stars, wind, snow, water, storm).
*   **Don't:** Engage in lengthy, atmospheric, or poetic descriptions of scenery.
*   **Don't:** Include detailed sensory information beyond what's needed for the plot (e.g., the glitter of gold if it tempts someone, the smell of food if it draws someone in).
*   **Don't:** Specify precise geography or historical periods. Keep it timeless and generic.
*   **Don't:** Describe the weather unless it directly impacts the plot (a storm causes a shipwreck, snow forces characters indoors).
*   **Don't:** Describe interiors in detail unless specific items are plot points (like the three bears' bowls/chairs/beds).
*   **Don't:** Create unique, specifically named fantasy locations; stick to the generic archetypes.

**Describing Events:**
*   **Do:** Describe actions clearly and sequentially. Focus on the chain of events.
*   **Do:** Focus on *what* happens rather than the character's internal *experience* of it.
*   **Do:** Maintain a straightforward, often brisk pace, even during dramatic or violent events.
*   **Do:** Use clear cause-and-effect logic, even when magic is the cause.
*   **Do:** State magical transformations plainly and quickly ("in a moment the frog was changed into a prince," "she was turned into stone").
*   **Do:** Describe violence bluntly and factually, without dwelling on graphic detail but also without sanitizing it ("cut off her head," "struck him dead," "pushed her into the oven").
*   **Do:** Use simple hyperbole for effort or speed ("ran as if fire were burning under him," "wept a river of tears").
*   **Do:** Clearly link transgressions to punishments or plot consequences (disobeying advice leads to trouble, breaking a taboo causes a curse).
*   **Do:** Use repetition effectively for tasks, journeys, or structure (three siblings attempt a task, three nights of trials, three questions asked).
*   **Do:** Describe journeys simply ("went on his way," "travelled for many days," "walked until nightfall").
*   **Do:** Conclude events decisively ("and so he married the princess," "and the witch was burnt to ashes").
*   **Don't:** Linger on gore or suffering purely for shock value. Violence is often matter-of-fact.
*   **Don't:** Slow down the narrative excessively for suspense or emotional reflection in a modern way. Suspense comes from the situation, not stylistic manipulation.
*   **Don't:** Explain the intricate mechanics or "rules" of magic. It simply works.
*   **Don't:** Build suspense by withholding information in a modern narrative style; surprises are often sudden reveals or consequences.
*   **Don't:** Focus on the detailed process of an action over its result (we know the tailor sewed something, not the stitch technique).
*   **Don't:** Describe internal physical sensations in detail (pain is stated, not elaborately described).
*   **Don't:** Use cliffhangers between chapters or sections in a modern sense.

**Complete List of Aspects to Always Leave Out:**
*   **Don't:** Deep exploration of a character's feelings or internal emotional landscape.
*   **Don't:** Complex psychological motivation or internal conflict.
*   **Don't:** Complex character arcs involving significant *internal* change (transformation is usually external/magical/status-based).
*   **Don't:** Ambiguous endings (resolutions are typically clear).
*   **Don't:** Moral relativism or significant grey areas (actions/characters tend towards clear good/evil).
*   **Don't:** Authorial intrusion, commentary, or winking at the audience (except perhaps simple closing morals).
*   **Don't:** Irony or satire (generally).
*   **Don't:** Realistic, meandering, or subtext-filled dialogue.
*   **Don't:** Extensive backstory or detailed world-building.
*   **Don't:** Focus on nuanced internal emotional states (emotion is shown via direct statement or action: weeping, rejoicing, shouting in anger, fleeing in fear).
*   **Don't:** Complex social commentary.
*   **Don't:** Nuanced depictions of societal structures, politics, or economics.
*   **Don't:** Scientific reasoning or naturalistic explanations for magical events.
*   **Don't:** Subjective points of view; narration is generally objective, focusing on the protagonist's external journey.
*   **Don't:** Intricate subplots that diverge significantly from the main quest/problem.
*   **Don't:** Modern-style fantasy names.

**Complete List of Aspects to (Almost) Always Include:**

*   **Do:** Archetypal settings (forests, castles, cottages, roads).
*   **Do:** Direct cause and effect (often involving magic or simple logic).

*   **Do:** Resolution where virtue is rewarded and vice punished (often physically and fittingly).
*   **Do:** Simple, declarative language and sentence structure as the base style.
*   **Do:** Focus on action and external events over introspection.
*   **Do:** A clear quest, task, or problem to be solved.

*   **Do:** Use of symbolic numbers, especially three and seven.
*   **Do:** Talking animals or objects that aid or hinder the protagonist.
*   **Do:** Formulaic openings ("Once upon a time...") and closings ("...lived happily ever after" / "...and there they live to this very day," or similar definitive end).

***

**Writing Style:**

**Choice of Words:**
*   **Do:** Lean towards simple, concrete language. Use words readily understood.
*   **Do:** Use functional adjectives (e.g., "old," "poor," "good," "shiny," "dark").
*   **Do:** In dialogue sprinkle in occasional archaic terms like "alas," "hark," "nigh," "dwelt," "prithee," "hark ye," "morrow," "hither," "thither," "aught," "naught," "beest," "betook."
*   **Do:** Use stock phrases like "as quick as lightning," "stone dead," "wide world," "heart's content," "day dawned," "many a time," "greatly rejoiced," "wept bitterly."
*   **Do:** Refer to characters generically (the youth, the maiden, the man, the wife, the king, the merchant, the beggar) when specific names aren't needed or given.
*   **Do:** Employ simple comparisons ("as white as snow," "shone like gold," "quiet as a mouse," "rose like mountains").
*   **Don't:** Use modern slang, jargon, technical terms, abstract concepts, or overly complex vocabulary (e.g., avoid "serendipitous," "infrastructure," "epiphany").
*   **Don't:** Use excessive or flowery adjectives (e.g., "the breathtakingly beautiful, scintillating princess"). Stick to simple descriptors.
*   **Don't:** Use sophisticated synonyms (e.g., use "sad" not "melancholy," "angry" not "irate," "beautiful" not "resplendent").
*   **Don't:** Use words that imply deep psychological states (e.g., "angst," "neurosis," "existential dread," "trauma").
*   **Don't:** Use overly technical terms even for trades (a tailor uses a "needle," not specific types; a captain has a "ship," not a specific vessel class).

**Sentence Structures:**
*   **Do:** Generally keep clauses relatively short and clear.
*   **Do:** Use simple sentences (one independent clause) and compound sentences (two or more independent clauses joined by a simple conjunction) predominantly.
*   **Do:** Link clauses mainly with simple conjunctions like "and," "but," "so," "or," "for," "then," or relative pronouns like "where," "who."
*   **Do:** Use active voice almost exclusively.
*   **Do:** Start sentences most frequently with "Then," "So," "And," "But," or the character's name/pronoun ("He," "She," "The youth").
*   **Do:** Employ parataxis (linking clauses with simple conjunctions rather than complex subordination).
*   **Do:** Frequently use reported speech introduced simply ("he said that...", "she told him to...").
*   **Do:** Occasionally use simple inversion for archaic flavour ("Then came the king...", "Down fell the penny...").
*   **Do:** Combine very short, consecutive sentences describing closely related actions to improve flow, often using "and" or "then" (e.g., "He picked it up and rubbed it hard" instead of "He picked it up. He rubbed it hard.").
*   **Don't:** Overuse passive voice.
*   **Don't:** Strive for complex sentence structures or excessive variety just for stylistic effect. Simplicity is key.
*   **Don't:** Use rhetorical questions frequently.
*   **Don't:** Use complex punctuation like semicolons or em-dashes. Commas and periods are generally sufficient.
*   **Don't:** Dramatically vary sentence length purely for modern pacing effects. Maintain a generally consistent, flowing rhythm.
*   **Don't:** Embed dialogue within complex narrative sentences often. Keep narration and dialogue distinct.
*   **Don't:** Start too many consecutive sentences with the exact same word (especially pronouns like "He" or "She") if it creates an awkward, choppy effect. Use simple conjunctions or vary the sentence start slightly where needed for better rhythm, while staying simple.

**Beginning the Story:**
*   **Do:** Start with formulaic openings like "Once upon a time," "There was once a king/man/widow..." or similar simple framing ("Long, long ago...").
*   **Do:** Establish the initial situation or character simply and quickly.
*   **Do:** Immediately introduce the core problem or lack (poverty, a quest needed, childlessness).
*   **Do:** Set the scene with minimal, functional detail (e.g., "Hard by a great forest dwelt a poor wood-cutter").
*   **Do:** Use phrases suggesting timelessness ("A long time ago," "In days of yore").
*   **Don't:** Begin in media res without clear context.
*   **Don't:** Use lengthy introductions or elaborate world-building upfront.
*   **Don't:** Start with dialogue before establishing who is speaking and where.
*   **Don't:** Use flashbacks or complex, non-linear timelines.
*   **Don't:** Hint at deeper symbolic meanings or abstract themes in the opening lines.

**Starting a Sentence:**
*   **Do:** Rely heavily on simple conjunctions ("And," "But," "So," "Then") or temporal markers ("When," "After," "Presently," "Soon afterwards," "On the morrow").
*   **Do:** Use character names or simple pronouns ("He," "She," "They," "The king").
*   **Do:** Begin occasionally with simple prepositional phrases ("In the morning," "At last," "Near the forest").
*   **Don't:** Frequently use complex adverbial phrases or sophisticated transitional words (e.g., "Consequently," "Nevertheless," "Furthermore," "Subsequently").
*   **Don't:** Start sentences with "-ing" clauses (participle phrases) often; prefer simpler constructions.
*   **Don't:** Use abstract nouns as sentence subjects often (e.g., "His melancholy dictated his actions").

**Dialogue:**
*   **Do:** Keep dialogue direct and functional – it should advance the plot, state intentions, make requests, or reveal necessary information.
*   **Do:** Use simple tags like "said he," "answered she," "cried he," "thought the penny."
*   **Do:** Let characters state their intentions or feelings plainly ("I must go thither," "I am hungry," "How happy am I!").
*   **Do:** Have characters repeat instructions or important information clearly if needed.
*   **Do:** Use direct address ("dear father," "my child," "Lord King," "good sir").
*   **Do:** Make requests and commands explicit ("Give me...", "Fetch me...", "Tell me...", "Go now!").
*   **Do:** Occasionally include simple rhymes or verses within speech if appropriate to the tale type.
*   **Don't:** Write naturalistic, rambling, or subtext-heavy conversation.
*   **Don't:** Use witty banter or clever wordplay.
*   **Don't:** Use elaborate dialogue tags describing tone or complex emotion ("he whispered menacingly," "she retorted sarcastically"). Keep tags simple or let the dialogue speak for itself.
*   **Don't:** Reveal character primarily through subtle conversational cues or indirect speech.
*   **Don't:** Use contractions ("don't," "can't") – write out "do not," "cannot."
*   **Don't:** Show hesitation through dialogue filler ("ums," "ahs") or fragmented sentences.
*   **Don't:** Have characters engage in abstract philosophical discussions.

**Describing Characters:**
*   **Do:** Describe characters briefly, focusing on archetypal traits (beautiful, ugly, old, young, rich, poor, clever, simple) or their role/profession (king, princess, soldier, miller, witch, dwarf). Use simple Anglo-Saxon or German names (Hans, Gretel, Wilhelm) or generic titles.
*   **Do:** Define characters primarily through their actions and direct speech.
*   **Do:** Introduce characters by their function or relationship (the stepmother, the youngest son, the old woman).
*   **Do:** Indicate basic emotional states directly ("he was angry," "she was glad," "they wept bitterly," "he feared greatly").
*   **Do:** Imply character through stark, decisive actions (e.g., sharing bread, abandoning children, fulfilling promises).
*   **Do:** Give animals human-like thoughts and speech when they are magical helpers or central figures.
*   **Do:** Include archetypal magical helpers (fairies, helpful animals, enchanted objects) and villains (witches, cruel relatives, giants, dragons, robbers).
*   **Don't:** Provide detailed physical descriptions unless a specific feature is crucial to the plot (e.g., Snow White's colors, Rapunzel's hair length, Cinderella's foot size).
*   **Don't:** Use internal monologue, extensive backstory exposition, or psychological analysis.
*   **Don't:** Explore conflicting emotions or internal moral debates within a character.
*   **Don't:** Give characters complex histories or motivations beyond the immediate needs of the plot (why the witch is evil is less important than that she *is* evil).
*   **Don't:** Make characters morally ambiguous in their fundamental nature (good characters might make mistakes or be foolish, but their core alignment is usually clear).
*   **Don't:** Show gradual, internal character development; changes are usually sudden, often magical or resulting from completing a task.
*   **Don't:** Give characters modern-sounding fantasy names (Elara, Kael, Zayne).

**Describing Setting:**
*   **Do:** Use simple, archetypal locations: forest, castle, cottage, well, mountain, road, garden, mill, inn, sea.
*   **Do:** Describe them briefly and functionally ("a deep gloomy wood," "a shining palace," "a poor hut," "an old dry well").
*   **Do:** Mention specific, simple objects only if crucial to the plot (a spindle, a golden ball, an oven, a key, a net, a spool of thread).
*   **Do:** Contrast settings simply if needed (rich house vs. poor house, dark forest vs. bright clearing).
*   **Do:** Use generic terms like "a great city," "a certain kingdom," "a faraway land."
*   **Do:** Include functional details like locked doors, windows, stairs, wells, hearths, stables only if relevant to the action.

*   **Do:** Keep the time frame vague and mythical.
*   **Do:**  Refer to time passing in simple terms ("Long after this," "After some time," "The next day," "When the time came").

*   **Don't:**  Focus on the details of farming or village life beyond what's necessary for the plot.

**Political Aspects:**

*   **Do:** Assume a simple feudal structure (king, nobles, peasants/commoners/servants).
*   **Do:** Portray royalty as having inherent authority.

*   **Do:**  Emphasize the importance of keeping promises (Frog Prince, King of the Golden Mountain, Rumpelstiltskin).
*   **Do:**  Show the dangers of greed and excessive desire (Fisherman's Wife, Cat and Mouse in Partnership).

*   **Don't:**  Explore redemption arcs for truly wicked characters (stepmothers, witches usually die).
*   **Don't:**  Suggest that luck is entirely random; it often favors the inherently good or the clever protagonist who follows advice.
*   **Don't:**  Question the justice of the punishments, even if severe by modern standards.

**Explaining to the Reader:**

*   **Do:** Report characters' thoughts simply ("he thought to himself," "she said to herself").
*   **Do:**  Occasionally use simple narrative summaries ("Thus they lived for two days," "This lasted for many years").
*   **Do:**  Maintain an objective, sometimes distant tone, reporting events without overt emotional colouring.
*   **Do:**  Let the story's structure, dialogue, and outcomes convey the meaning and morals implicitly.
*   **Do:**  Use simple transitions like "Now it happened that..." or "It came to pass..."
*   **Don't:** Address the reader directly often (rare exceptions like "as you may think it" in Tom Thumb are unusual).
*   **Don't:** Explain character motivations in depth.
*   **Don't:** Interpret events for the reader.
*   **Don't:** Build suspense through narrative tricks like foreshadowing or withholding information.
*   **Don't:**  Offer alternative interpretations or pose questions to the reader.

**Incorporating Modern Perspectives:**

*   **Do:** Don't.
*   **Do:**  Strictly adhere to the stylistic and thematic conventions observed in the source texts.
*   **Do:**  Embrace the simplicity, directness, and archetypal nature of the tales.
*   **Do:**  Accept the often harsh consequences and clear moral lines as part of the style.
*   **Don't:** Attempt to "update" the morals or characterizations while retaining the Grimm *style*.
*   **Don't:** Alter the fundamental conventions of the style.
*   **Explanation:** The goal is to replicate the Grimm style *exactly*. Modern perspectives on psychology, social justice, gender roles, narrative complexity, or moral ambiguity are fundamentally incompatible with the directness, simplicity, and specific worldview presented in these tales. Introducing them breaks the authenticity of the style.  Attempting to "update" the morals or characterizations while retaining the Grimm *style* is contradictory and usually results in something that is neither authentically Grimm nor a successful modern story.  Focus on mastering the existing conventions, not altering them.
