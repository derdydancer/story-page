  "The Complete Story": {
    "Chapters": [
      "There was once a king whose power was great, but whose heart was harder than stone, and he ruled his lands with an iron fist. It pleased him most to see others weep, and their tears were the only water that could make his laughter grow. This king had a son, a prince, who grew tall in the palace, learning the ways of power. The prince seemed in all ways like his father, quick to anger and sharp of tongue. In that kingdom dwelt a people who toiled in the great kilns, fire-keepers who spoke little and whose faces were marked by soot and sorrow. These people belonged to the king, as did the tongs and the bellows they worked. One day, the king commanded the prince to go down to the kilns, saying there was troublesome noise amongst that folk. The prince obeyed, and went down towards the smoke and the heat. The air there was thick with ash, and the only sound was a low chant that rose and fell with the bellows. He stood and watched the folk moving like shadows in the gloom, their sorrow a cloak upon them.",
      "An overseer walked among them, whip in hand, his eyes missing nothing. He saw an old fire-keeper stumble, and the overseer struck the man hard across the back, so that he fell without a sound. Then the prince stepped forward and said to the overseer, 'Hold your hand.' The overseer turned, surprised, and sneered, 'Who are you to command me here?' The prince replied, 'I am the king's son, and you will obey.' The overseer hesitated, then slowly lowered his whip, his eyes full of malice. All the fire-keepers had stopped their work, watching in silence. The prince turned away then, his task done, and walked back towards the palace gates. As he reached the edge of the kiln-yard, something small and hard struck his boot – a piece of fired clay, marked with a strange sign. He picked it up, looked at the strange sign, and quickly hid it within his cloak.",
      "Years passed, and the prince grew older, learning much of statecraft and war. He became known as cunning in council and swift in action. The marked piece of clay he kept hidden, speaking of it to none. Then war came to the borders of the kingdom from a land beyond the mountains. The king ordered the prince to lead the army against this foe. So the prince gathered the king's soldiers and rode out to meet the enemy. The two armies clashed on a wide plain, and the noise was terrible. The prince fought fiercely, always at the forefront where the danger was greatest. But the enemy pressed hard, and the prince was struck down from his horse and lay upon the ground as one dead. His army scattered and fled, leaving him behind on the blood-soaked earth.",
      "Night fell, and the moon rose over the field of the dead. Then the prince stirred upon the ground and opened his eyes. He was grievously wounded, and when he tried to rise, he could not. Then he felt a strange warmth spread through him, seeming to flow from the earth beneath. His strength returned tenfold, and he saw his wound close as if by magic. He rose to his feet, and felt different than before, as if a great power thrummed within him. He looked about the moonlit field at the fallen soldiers. He saw the enemy soldiers moving among the dead, taking plunder. A great anger rose in the prince then, and he took up a fallen sword. He fell upon the enemy soldiers like a whirlwind, his sword a blur of silver light.",
      "None could stand before him, and those that were able soon fled into the darkness. Soon the prince stood alone on the plain once more, breathing easily and unharmed. He turned then and began the long walk back towards his father's kingdom. When he reached the city gates, there was great amazement, for all had thought him dead. He was brought before the king, who looked hard at his son. The prince said only, 'The enemy is fled. The victory is ours.' The king was pleased, and showed his son great favour from that day forth. The prince used his power wisely in the ways of the court, and grew mighty in the kingdom. Men whispered that something had changed him on the field of battle. But the prince kept his own counsel, and revealed nothing of the warmth from the earth.",
      "Yet still the people of the kilns toiled in the heat and the soot. The king demanded ever more bricks for his new palaces, and hotter fires for his forges. The fire-keepers grew thinner, and the cough from the smoke settled deep in their chests. Then the king made a terrible new law: all boy-children born to the kiln folk were to be thrown into the river. A great cry of sorrow went up from the kiln-yards then, but none dared disobey the king. The prince heard the crying from his high palace window, but did nothing. He took out the piece of marked clay sometimes, and looked upon the strange sign. One night, an old woman from the kiln folk, cloaked and bent, came secretly to the palace gate and begged to see the prince. The guards would have turned her away, for none of the kiln folk were permitted entry. But the prince happened to pass by and saw her, and ordered the guards to let her enter.",
      "In a small, secret chamber, the prince met the old woman and asked her business. She bowed low and said, 'Great prince, have pity. Speak to the king, your father, for the sake of your own mother who bore you, and save our children from the river.' The prince sat silent for a long time, and looked at the floor. Then he said, 'Old woman, the king's word is law. I cannot change it.' The old woman looked at him then, and slowly opened her cloak. Beneath it, held in her trembling hands, was a piece of old, stained swaddling cloth. 'This cloth wrapped the king's son,' she said softly, 'when he was saved from the river years ago, a child of our people.' The prince stared at the cloth, then at the sign marked upon it – the same sign as on the piece of fired clay he kept hidden. He understood then that the sign was the mark of his own hidden kin. Wordlessly, the prince reached out and laid his hand upon the old woman's arm.",
      "From that night forward, the prince moved differently through the palace halls. His face was unchanged, and his words were still cunning, but he kept his secret deep inside. He went often and secretly to the kiln-yards, not as a prince, but as one seeking knowledge. He spoke quietly with the elders there, learning their history and their old ways. A plan took shape in his mind, slow and careful, and his thoughts grew sharp as glass. He went to the king then and spoke of a great new building project, a monument to the king's glory. For this, he said, much water would be needed, drawn from the great river that fed the kilns. The king, pleased by the thought of the monument and the flattery, agreed readily. So channels were dug, and the river water was diverted, and soon the water level feeding the kilns lowered greatly. The kilns grew too hot to manage well, many bricks cracked, and the king grew angry at the waste.",
      "Then the prince went again to the king, speaking of rare coloured clays needed for the monument. These clays, he said, lay in deep pits near the kiln-yards, and required much digging. The king, thinking only of his monument, again agreed. So the digging began, and the ground around the kilns shifted, and some kiln walls cracked from the unsteady earth. The king raged at the damage and blamed the kiln folk for poor work. A third time the prince went to the king, this time speaking of pests ruining the stored monument bricks. He suggested burning damp straw and refuse near the kilns to create a great smoke to drive the pests away. The king, impatient with the delays and troubles, waved him on to do it. So damp straw was burned, and a great foul smoke arose, filling the air and stinging the eyes. It drifted even to the palace, making the king cough and his courtiers weep from the sting.",
      "The king was furious then, and sent for the prince. 'These troubles began with your plans!' the king roared. 'The water low, the ground unsteady, this choking smoke – it is your doing!' The prince stood tall before him, his face clear and no longer cunning. 'It is true, father,' he said, his voice ringing clear. 'I am Prince of this kingdom, but I am also of the kiln folk. Let my people go.' The king rose from his throne, his face purple with rage. 'Never!' he bellowed. 'They are mine!' Then the prince raised his hand, and the strange power he had gained on the battlefield surged within him. The very stone of the palace began to tremble, and the ground shook mightily. Fear showed on the king's face for the first time, and he stumbled and fell from his throne. The prince turned his back on the fallen king and went out, and all the kiln folk followed him from the broken city. They walked towards the mountains, seeking a new home where the air was clear."
