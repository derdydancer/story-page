The Widow and the Enchanted Toad
There was once a poor widow who lived in a little hut at the edge of the village. Her cupboard was bare, and she had not a crumb of bread left for her supper. So she took her apron and went into the forest nearby to gather sticks for her fire. As she bent down, her hand touched not a stick, but a round stone, smooth and grey. She picked it up and thought, 'Well, it is not bread, but perhaps I can boil it for soup.' She put the stone in her apron with the few dry sticks she had gathered and went home to her hut. She made a small fire in her hearth, filled her only pot with water from the well, and put the smooth, grey stone into the water to boil. The water bubbled and boiled, but the stone just sat at the bottom like any other stone and made no soup at all. Then, a little voice came from the pot, saying, 'Must you boil me so hard? It is quite unpleasant down here.' The widow jumped back from the hearth and stared at the pot.
'Well, are you going to stare all day?' said the voice from the pot, 'Pray take me out, I am getting wrinkly.' The widow fetched a wooden spoon and carefully lifted the hot stone out onto the hearth. The stone shook itself once, twice, and then rolled over, and it was no stone at all, but a fat brown toad. 'Much obliged,' croaked the toad, 'Being boiled is no treat for anyone, you know.' 'Goodness me,' said the widow, finding her voice, 'What are you, and how did you come to be a stone?' 'I am merely a toad,' he replied, 'Though I was not always so. A wicked sorcerer whose path I unfortunately crossed turned me to stone for splashing mud on his boots.' 'I have been a stone for a hundred years, waiting by the path.' 'And how did boiling you turn you back?' asked the widow. 'Ah, the boiling did not do it,' said the toad, 'The spell required warmth, water, and a bit of foolish kindness all at once. Trying to boil a stone for soup was just foolish enough.' 'Well,' said the widow, 'Foolish or not, I am still hungry, and now I have boiled my only stone.'
'For your foolish kindness,' said the toad, 'I can perhaps help with that. I know a way to banish hunger from this hut.' 'Take the apron in which you carried me,' instructed the toad, 'And shake it firmly three times towards the empty table.' The widow, though puzzled, took her apron and shook it thrice towards the table. No sooner had she done so, than a fresh loaf of bread, a round of yellow cheese, and a jug of creamy milk appeared upon the bare wood. The widow ate until she was content, and the toad took a crumb of cheese for himself. 'You may do this each day,' said the toad, 'But only if I remain here with you. Keep me safe, and your cupboard will stay full.' 'Indeed I will,' said the widow, 'You may have the warmest corner by the hearth for your own.' And so they lived quite contentedly for some time, the widow and the toad, and she was never hungry again. One day, however, a stout, red-faced merchant knocked upon her door, seeking shelter from a sudden rainstorm. The widow, being kind, let him in to dry himself by her fire, and he looked about the poor hut.
As evening fell, the widow shook her apron thrice towards the table. At once, a fine roast chicken, a loaf of white bread, and a cake with raisins appeared there. The merchant's eyes grew wide, and he stared first at the food and then at the widow, asking, 'How did you perform this wonder?' 'It is not I, but my friend the toad who sits by the hearth,' answered the widow simply. The merchant looked down at the toad in the corner, who winked one eye, and the merchant thought, 'A talking toad that makes food appear? Such a thing must be worth a fortune!' He turned to the widow and said, 'Good woman, you are poor, and I am rich. Sell me this toad, and I will give you this heavy purse of gold.' 'Nay, sir,' replied the widow, 'He is my friend who saved me from hunger, and I have promised to keep him safe. He is not for sale.' The merchant scowled but said no more, though he thought to himself, 'If she will not sell, perhaps I can find another way.' He accepted the widow's offer to sleep on a pile of straw by the door until the rain stopped. When the widow was fast asleep, the merchant crept quietly to the hearth, snatched up the sleeping toad, popped him into a sack, and hurried away into the night.
In the morning, the widow awoke and went to shake her apron for her breakfast. She shook it once, twice, thrice, but the table remained bare, and nothing appeared. She looked to the hearth, but the toad's warm corner was empty, and the toad was gone. Then she knew at once that the wicked merchant must have stolen him. She ran out of her hut with no shoes on her feet and only her apron about her, determined to follow him. She followed the road the merchant must have taken, and soon she came upon a very large brown cow standing squarely in the middle of the path, chewing its cud. 'Pray let me pass, good cow,' said the widow, 'For I am in a great hurry.' The cow turned its large head slowly and said, 'I will let you pass, but first you must scratch my left ear, just behind the horn, where it itches terribly.' The widow, though surprised, did as the cow asked and gave its left ear a good scratching. The cow sighed contentedly and moved aside from the path.
The widow hurried on, but before long she came to a large flock of white geese blocking the way, honking loudly. 'Good geese, pray let me pass!' called the widow over the noise, 'I am in a great hurry and cannot hear myself think!' One large gander stepped forward and hissed, 'We will let you pass, mistress, but only if you tell us a story, for we are dreadfully bored standing here.' The widow, thinking quickly, told a very short story about a fox and a feather. The geese seemed to enjoy this greatly, and they parted with much honking laughter to let her pass. She went on again, faster now, until finally she came to a tall hedge of thick thorns blocking the road entirely. The widow did not stop this time, but pushed her way through the sharp thorns, which tore her apron and scratched her arms. On the other side, she saw she was at the entrance to a busy market town, and there in the main square stood the merchant. He was holding up the sack and shouting to the crowd, 'A wonder! A marvel! A toad that makes feasts appear! Who will buy this magic toad for only one hundred gold pieces?' The widow ran forward through the crowd and snatched the sack from his hand before he could blink.
'Thief! Stop her!' shouted the merchant angrily, 'She has stolen my valuable toad!' The crowd began to gather round, muttering and pointing at the poor widow in her torn apron. But just then, the sack began to wiggle, and the toad hopped out and sat upon the widow's shoulder. 'Silence!' croaked the toad loudly, his voice surprisingly deep, 'This man is the thief! He stole me from this good woman who showed me kindness!' The crowd gasped at the talking toad, stared at the merchant, and then turned towards him angrily. The merchant turned pale, dropped his now empty purse, and ran away as fast as his stout legs could carry him, disappearing from the town. The crowd cheered for the widow and the clever toad, and made way for her respectfully. The widow, with the toad safely on her shoulder, walked back towards her hut. 'Good widow,' said the toad as they walked, 'Know that I am not truly a toad, but an enchanted prince.' 'Your kindness broke the first part of the spell, and your courage broke the last. Will you marry me?' And the widow agreed, and at once he became a handsome prince, and they lived happily in the hut, which was now always full of good things.
