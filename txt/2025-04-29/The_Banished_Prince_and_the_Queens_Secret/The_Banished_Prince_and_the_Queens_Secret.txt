The Banished Prince and the Queen's Secret
Once upon a time, there was a king who ruled a large and prosperous kingdom. His queen had been fair in her youth, but it was said that strife followed her footsteps. The king had two sons; the elder prince often looked to the borders of the kingdom and counted the soldiers in the yard. The younger brother, however, tended the palace gardens and sometimes spoke to the birds that came there. Now, the king loved his younger son more dearly, for his ways were gentle. The elder prince saw this, and he grew quiet in the king's halls but often sharpened his hunting knife. The queen watched both her sons from the high windows of the palace, but said naught. One harvest time, the king called his sons and bade them each bring an offering to the temple beyond the palace walls. The younger brother gathered the finest fruits from his garden and the brightest flowers. The elder prince went into the woods and brought back a young roe that he had slain with his sharp knife.
Both sons laid their gifts upon the cold stone of the temple altar. The king smiled upon the fruits and flowers and praised his younger son's diligence. At the slain roe offered by the elder, the king looked but briefly and nodded only. The elder prince's face grew dark as a thundercloud, and he turned away from the altar without a word. Then the two brothers left the temple and walked back towards the palace. The younger brother spoke cheerfully about his gardens and the coming spring. The elder prince stopped and said to his brother, 'Let us walk awhile in the meadow by the river.' The younger brother agreed readily, and they turned from the path. It was a quiet place, with tall grasses whispering by the water's edge. There, the elder prince took his sharp knife from his belt and struck his younger brother, so that he fell down dead amongst the grasses.
Then the elder prince dragged the body into the thick reeds by the river bank and pushed it deep amongst them. He wiped his knife clean on the green leaves and put it back in his belt. Then he walked back alone towards the palace. When the king saw him arrive, he asked, 'Where is your brother?' The elder prince answered, 'I know not; perhaps he lingered in the meadow. Am I my brother's keeper?' The king looked hard at his elder son, then sent out servants to search the meadow by the river. Soon the servants returned, for they had found the king's younger son lying cold amongst the reeds. Then a great sorrow fell upon the palace; the king wept bitterly, and the queen tore her hair. But the elder prince stood silent in the great hall and shed no tear. The king declared that his elder son must be banished from the kingdom forever, and made a secret mark upon his brow so that all might know his crime.
So the elder prince rode out from the city gates alone. He travelled for many days through forests and over hills, and knew not whither he went. In the villages he passed, people saw the mark upon his brow and turned away from him in fear or scorn. He begged for crusts of bread at cottage doors and slept under hedges when night fell. He thought often only of how he might find food, and sometimes of how he might find power again. At last he came into a barren land where few trees grew and the wind blew cold. There, by a grey rock, stood a small hut made of stones and mud. An old woman sat in the doorway, spinning thread, and she looked up at him with sharp eyes. She said, 'That is a dark mark you carry on your brow, banished prince.' The prince started, then bowed his head and answered, 'Old mother, I am he.'
'Then serve me for seven years,' said the old woman, 'and perhaps the mark may fade.' The prince, having nowhere else to go, agreed to her words. So he dwelt in the hut and served the old woman, fetching water from a stony well and chopping dry wood for her fire. The long years passed by, and the prince faithfully did all she bade him. Yet the mark on his brow did not fade, not even by a little. He grew thin, and his hands became rough with work. But his eyes grew sharp like the old woman's, and he learned silence. When the seven years were ended, the old woman called the prince to her. She said, 'You have served me well. Go now, but take this small grey cloak with you.'
'If you put it on and wish yourself elsewhere,' she told him, 'you will be there in an instant.' The prince took the grey cloak, thanked the old woman, and left the barren land behind him. He put on the cloak and wished himself in a town where he might find a good inn, and straightaway he stood before one. The landlord looked closely at the prince's worn clothes, and at the mark upon his brow. But the prince spoke cleverly, saying he was the servant of a powerful master who travelled unseen, and so the landlord gave him a room. In the inn, the prince sat quietly and heard talk from merchants travelling from his own kingdom. They spoke of how the queen had wed a neighbouring king, but found no joy, and now lay grievously ill. When the prince heard this, he went to his room, put on his grey cloak, and wished himself in the palace of his fathers. In the blink of an eye, he found himself standing in an empty corridor of the palace. He listened, and heard the sound of weeping coming from the queen's chambers.
He drew the grey cloak tighter about him, and none could see him as he passed. He entered the queen's chambers and saw her lying pale upon her bed, while her new husband, the neighbouring king, sat nearby. The queen sighed weakly and said, 'Alas, for my first husband's kingdom, and for the rightful heir who was banished.' Her husband spoke soft words but seemed little moved, and bade her only rest. The banished prince watched all this from the shadows, unseen. A physician came and looked upon the queen, then shook his head, saying there was little hope. But when the physician left, the prince sped away unseen with his cloak, and returned moments later bearing a strange, dark herb. Still unseen, he crushed the herb and mixed it with water, then touched the cup to the queen's lips, and at once colour returned to her face. She sat up in bed and spoke clearly, and the new king and the attendants were greatly amazed. Before any could guess the cause, the prince slipped away again, still wrapped in his grey cloak.
The next morning, the queen, now strong again, called her husband to her side. She said, 'Husband, I must tell you what I saw in my fever-dreams, or perhaps it was a truth shown to me near death's door.' 'It was not the elder son who struck down the younger in the meadow,' the queen declared. 'Nay, it was I, his own mother, who did the deed, for he discovered a secret I could not bear to be known.' 'And I let the blame fall upon my elder son, whose ambition I feared,' she continued. The neighbouring king sat as if turned to stone, his eyes wide. From the corner, wrapped in his cloak, the banished prince heard every word. 'Now,' said the queen, her voice growing faint again, 'you must find my banished son and tell him... tell him before I die.'
Then she closed her eyes and breathed no more. The neighbouring king sat long in thought beside the bed, then rose, barred the door, and called his own guards. But the banished prince, quicker than thought, wished himself far from that room and was instantly gone. He appeared in the busy market square of the city and took off the grey cloak. The mark was still upon his brow for all to see. He went straight to the palace gates and demanded entry as the king's first son. The guards were astonished and hesitated, seeing the mark but hearing his commanding voice. Word ran quickly through the palace that the banished prince had returned. The neighbouring king heard this in his council chamber and ordered the gates barred fast and the prince seized as a traitor. But the prince called out in a loud voice to the guards and the assembling crowd, telling of the queen's confession and naming her the true murderer.
There was a great stir among the people, and much murmuring against the neighbouring king. Some remembered the queen's coldness after her younger son's death, and the elder prince's swift banishment without trial. The guards at the gate lowered their spears and refused the order to seize the prince. The neighbouring king saw his power gone in that moment, and he fled the palace by a secret way. Then the banished prince entered the palace gates, and the people acclaimed him. And as he stepped across the threshold into the great hall, the mark upon his brow vanished away entirely. He ruled the kingdom wisely for many years, strengthened the borders, and kept the granaries full. He took a wife, a princess from a peaceful neighbouring land. But it is said he did not forget his younger brother, nor the price of envy. And he lived long, and ruled well until the end of his days.
