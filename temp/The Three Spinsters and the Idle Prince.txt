In a kingdom famed for its fine linen lived a king whose only son was handsome but exceedingly idle. The prince cared for nothing but hunting all day and feasting all night. The king despaired, for the kingdom needed a future ruler who understood diligence.

One day, the king summoned his son. ‘Son,’ he said, ‘it is time you took a wife. But you shall only marry a princess who can spin the finest thread, weave the strongest cloth, and sew the most perfect shirt in a single day.’

The prince groaned. ‘Father, where can such a woman be found? It is an impossible task!’

‘Nevertheless,’ said the king, ‘those are my terms. Go forth and seek her.’

The prince, caring little for the task but eager to escape his father’s lectures, rode out. He travelled aimlessly, hunting as he went. After some days, he found himself lost in a deep wood. As night fell, he saw a light and came upon a tiny, tumbledown hut. Inside sat three very old women, spinning by the dim light of a single candle.

The first woman had a thumb as broad and flat as a shovel from constantly drawing the thread. The second had a lower lip so droopy it covered her chin, from moistening the thread as she spun. The third had a foot as wide and splayed as a goose’s, from working the treadle day in and day out.

‘Good evening, mothers,’ said the prince, amused by their strange looks. ‘Can you offer a lost hunter shelter for the night?’

‘Welcome, young sir,’ said the first, her broad thumb never pausing. ‘But we have little to offer.’

‘We work from dawn till dusk,’ said the second, her lip flapping as she spoke.

‘And barely earn our bread,’ finished the third, her foot tapping the floor rhythmically.

The prince, seeing their ceaseless work, suddenly remembered his father’s quest. A sly thought entered his head. ‘Mothers,’ he said, ‘I seek a bride who is skilled in spinning, weaving, and sewing. My father, the king, demands she make a shirt in a single day. Could any of you perform such a feat?’

The three old women looked at each other, then chuckled, a dry, rustling sound. ‘Perhaps we could, young sir,’ said the one with the broad thumb. ‘But what reward would there be for such labour?’

‘Reward?’ said the prince. ‘Why, marriage to me, the king’s son!’

‘Hmm,’ said the second woman, moistening her thread. ‘A prince for a husband… But we are old and ill-favoured.’

‘Ah,’ said the prince craftily, ‘my father asks only for the skill, not the beauty. If you can make the shirt, I shall claim you as my bride – whichever of you does the finest work.’ He thought to himself he would simply take the shirt and leave the ugly spinsters behind.

‘There is one condition,’ said the third woman, her foot tapping faster. ‘If we do this for you, you must promise not to be ashamed of us. You must call us your dear aunts, and invite us to sit at the high table at your wedding feast.’

The prince readily agreed, thinking the wedding feast would never happen, or if it did, he could easily hide them away. ‘I promise faithfully!’ he declared.

So, the next morning, the prince procured the finest flax. The first woman spun it with her broad thumb, drawing a thread so fine it was almost invisible. The second took the thread, moistened it with her droopy lip, and wove it on a hidden loom into cloth smoother and stronger than silk. The third took the cloth and, pressing the treadle with her wide foot, sewed a shirt so perfect that no seam could be seen. All this they did before the sun had set.

The prince marvelled at the shirt. He thanked the old women curtly, took the shirt, and rode away, forgetting his promise almost at once. He presented the shirt to his father, boasting of the princess he had found who made it.

The king was overjoyed. ‘You have found her!’ he cried. ‘Prepare for the wedding!’

The prince was married soon after to a neighbouring princess (for he never intended to marry the spinsters), and a great feast was prepared. As the prince sat beside his new bride at the high table, three carriages drew up to the palace gate. Out stepped the three old spinsters, dressed in strange, old-fashioned finery.

They hobbled into the hall. The prince turned pale when he saw them. They came straight to the high table. ‘Good day to you, dear nephew!’ croaked the first, showing her broad thumb.

‘Health to you, dear nephew!’ lisped the second, her lip flapping.

‘Joy to you, dear nephew!’ tapped the third, pointing to her wide foot.

The king stared. ‘Son,’ he asked, ‘who are these strange women?’

The prince flushed red, ashamed. He mumbled, ‘They are… some old aunts of mine.’

‘Aunts?’ said the king. ‘But how came they by such deformities? Tell me, good aunts, how did you get such broad thumbs, droopy lips, and splayed feet?’

‘Ah, Your Majesty,’ said the first, ‘from spinning, naught but spinning!’

‘Aye,’ said the second, ‘from weaving, day after day!’

‘Indeed,’ said the third, ‘from treadling the loom, year in, year out!’

The prince’s bride looked with horror at the deformed women, then at her own delicate hands and feet. She turned to the prince. ‘Husband,’ she declared firmly, ‘if this is what comes of spinning, weaving, and sewing, then I shall never touch spindle, loom, or needle again as long as I live! Let the maids do such work!’

And so, because of the prince’s forgotten promise and his shame, his bride remained as idle as he was, and the three old spinsters sat grinning at the high table, enjoying the best of the feast.
