There once lived a woman named Martha whose house was the cleanest in the village, whose doorstep was scrubbed white, and whose garden path had not a pebble out of place. She spent her days washing, scrubbing, sweeping, and tidying, and frowned upon dust as if it were a sin. She even scolded the birds for leaving feathers near her fence and swept the dew off the grass each morning.

Her neighbours thought her excessively tidy, but Martha believed cleanliness was the highest virtue. "Order is everything," she would declare. "Chaos belongs in the ditches."

Now, in the damp ditches and muddy puddles around the village lived the Mud Sprites, tiny creatures no bigger than a thumb, made of earth and water. They were mischievous but harmless beings who delighted in the squish of mud, the tumble of leaves, and the general untidiness of nature. They resented Martha's constant scrubbing and sweeping near their dwelling places.

One day, Martha decided the muddy ditch running behind her spotless garden was an eyesore. She took her shovel and pail and began digging it out, intending to line it neatly with smooth white stones she had collected. As she dug, she disturbed the Sprites' homes, scattering their tiny mud castles and leaf boats.

That evening, as Martha slept soundly in her immaculate bed, the Mud Sprites crept out. They were angry. They swarmed into her house through a crack under the door she had somehow missed sealing. Silently, they went to work.

They didn't break anything or steal anything. Instead, they brought chaos. They unravelled her knitting, leaving tangled yarn. They swapped the salt and sugar pots. They turned all the pictures on the wall slightly askew. They ruffled the perfectly smooth bedcovers. They left tiny, muddy footprints (which vanished as they dried) on her scrubbed floor. And, most vexing of all, they took every single pair of shoes in the house – her sturdy walking shoes, her Sunday shoes, her indoor slippers – and placed them neatly, but filled to the brim, with thick, wet mud from the ditch.

Martha awoke the next morning and saw the slight disarray. A frown creased her brow. She straightened the pictures, retidied the bedcovers, untangled the yarn. But when she went to put on her slippers and found them full of mud, she let out a shriek of fury. She checked her other shoes – all filled with mud!

Fuming, she cleaned them all meticulously, scrubbing until her knuckles were raw. That night, she blocked the crack under the door and went to bed, sure she had secured her home against intruders.

But the Sprites found another way in – down the chimney. Again, they created subtle chaos. This time, they hid her spectacles, swapped the labels on her herb jars, and tied tiny knots in all her sewing threads. And again, they filled every shoe with mud.

This went on for a week. Every night, Martha tidied and secured; every morning, she awoke to small acts of disorder and shoes full of mud. She grew frantic, exhausted by the constant cleaning and the unsettling feeling of being watched and subtly mocked. Her perfect house felt violated.

Finally, nearing tears of frustration, she sat down on her spotless stool, looked at her mud-filled shoes, and for the first time, wondered *why*. Why would anyone do this? It wasn't theft or vandalism, just... disorder. She thought of the ditch, how she had dug it out so fiercely. She thought of the birds she scolded, the dew she swept away.

A thought occurred to her. Perhaps... perhaps a little bit of untidiness wasn't so bad? Perhaps the world wasn't meant to be scrubbed quite so clean?

That evening, she did not scrub the mud from her shoes. Instead, she took them outside and placed them gently by the ditch she had disturbed. She went inside, leaving the door slightly ajar, and went to bed without checking every corner for dust.

The next morning, she awoke hesitantly. The house was... peaceful. Nothing was askew. Her spectacles were on the table, the herb jars correctly labelled, the sewing threads smooth. And when she looked outside, her shoes stood empty and clean beside the ditch. In the mud nearby, almost too small to see, were patterns that looked like tiny, joyful footprints dancing away.

Martha never became untidy, but she learned to live with a speck of dust here and there. She left the ditch alone, let the birds scatter feathers, and allowed the dew to dry naturally on the grass. And the Mud Sprites, their small measure of chaos respected, never troubled her again.
