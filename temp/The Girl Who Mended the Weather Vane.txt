On a windswept hill overlooking the sea, there stood a cluster of poor fishermen's cottages. In one lived a little girl with nimble fingers and a kind heart. Her father was often away on his boat, leaving her to tend their small garden and keep watch over the waves.

Atop the oldest cottage, though not her own, perched a rusty iron weather vane shaped like a cockerel. It had been stuck fast for years, always pointing east, no matter how the wind blew. The old fisherman who lived there was too frail to climb and fix it, and the other villagers had no time for such things.

One day, a fierce storm blew in from the sea. The wind howled, and the waves crashed against the rocks. The little girl worried for her father. As she watched the storm from her window, she saw the rusty weather vane straining against the wind. With a loud groan, it tore partly loose from its mounting, hanging precariously by a single strap.

When the storm passed and the sun returned, the girl saw the damaged weather vane hanging sadly. "Poor cockerel," she thought. "You look hurt." Though it was not her task, she felt pity for it. She found her father's small hammer and a handful of sturdy nails. She asked the old fisherman if she might try to fix his vane, and he, surprised, nodded his assent.

Carefully, the girl climbed onto the low roof. The iron cockerel was heavier than it looked. She pushed it back into place, her small fingers struggling with the bent metal strap. Patiently, she hammered the old nails tight and added two new ones for strength. She even used a rag to wipe away some of the thickest rust. At last, the cockerel stood upright again. With a gentle nudge, she set it spinning. It turned smoothly in the sea breeze, facing west.

As she climbed down, she heard a faint, creaky whisper, seemingly from the air itself. *"Thank you, little one. A kindness given is a kindness earned."*

The girl looked around, but saw no one. She thought it must be the wind sighing through the eaves.

But the next morning, as she went to the shore, the creaky whisper came again. *"South wind rising. Tell the boats to wait."* She looked up. The iron cockerel on the roof was pointing south, though the morning breeze still felt gentle. She trusted the strange voice. She ran along the shore, calling to the fishermen preparing their boats, "Wait! A south wind is coming!"

Some laughed, but the older fishermen, knowing the sea's tricks, paused. And indeed, within the hour, a sudden squall blew up from the south, tossing the waves mightily. The boats that had stayed ashore were safe. Those few who had ignored the warning were caught out and struggled back to harbour with torn nets and frightened hearts.

From then on, the weather vane often whispered warnings to the girl. *"Fog rolling in,"* it would creak, and she would tell the fishermen. *"Fair winds for three days,"* it sighed, and the boats sailed out confidently. *"Distant sail, flying the black flag,"* it warned once, allowing the villagers to hide their few valuables before pirates passed harmlessly offshore.

The little girl never knew why the weather vane spoke only to her, or how. She simply listened, and helped her village. Her kindness to the rusty cockerel had brought safety to them all. The cockerel, for its part, turned faithfully in the wind, keeping watch over the sea, its creaky whispers a secret shared only with the girl with the nimble fingers and the kind heart.
