There was a baker who lived in a town beside a swift-flowing river. He was an honest man, but poor, for the Guild Master in the town was greedy and demanded a heavy fee each year. This Guild Master was also the town's chief merchant, fat and proud, and it was whispered he used false weights at his scales.

One day, the baker could not pay the fee. The Guild Master laughed cruelly. "Then yield your shop to me, baker, or find the gold by tomorrow noon!"

The baker went home heavy of heart. He had naught but flour for one last batch of bread. As he sat despairing, a little grey bird flew in his window, which he had never seen before. It hopped onto his table and chirped, looking at his flour sack.

"Little bird," sighed the baker, "I have nothing for you, nor soon for myself."

The bird chirped again, then pecked three times at an old, dusty recipe book the baker's grandmother had left him, a book he had never opened. Then it flew away. Curious, the baker opened the book. On the first page, in faded ink, was a recipe for "Truth-Teller's Bread." It looked simple enough, but at the bottom were strange words: *'Who eats this loaf, whateâ€™er they hide, / Their secret thoughts will speak inside. / One slice tells truth for one short hour, / Use wisely this revealing power.'*

The baker, having nothing to lose, decided to try it. He mixed the dough exactly as written, using his last flour. The bread rose beautifully and baked to a golden brown. It smelled like any other loaf. He wrapped one loaf carefully and took it, warm from the oven, to the Guild Master's house just before noon.

"Master Merchant," said the baker humbly, "I have no gold. But I bring you the finest loaf I have ever baked, as a sign of respect."

The Guild Master sneered but took the bread, for he was fond of fresh loaves. "This changes nothing, baker. The shop is mine at noon." He broke off a piece and began to eat it as the baker turned sadly away.

As the baker walked through the town square, he heard a commotion from the Guild Master's house. The Guild Master stood upon his balcony, shouting. "Yes, my scales are weighted!" he bellowed, his face red. "I cheat you all! That shipment of wool was full of moths! And I paid the watchman to look away when my nephew stole the widow's pig!" People gathered, gasping and pointing. The Guild Master seemed unable to stop himself, revealing one dishonest deed after another. This continued for nigh on an hour, until the effect wore off, leaving him spluttering and aghast in front of the furious townsfolk.

Seeing his chance, the baker hurried back to his shop and baked another Truth-Teller's Loaf. He went to the Town Hall where the Mayor and councilmen were discussing the Guild Master's sudden confession. The baker offered the fresh loaf to them, saying, "Good sirs, perhaps some refreshment while you deliberate?"

The Mayor, a portly man fond of his comfort, took a large slice. Soon he began to speak. "Indeed, the Guild Master is a rogue," he declared, "but profitable! I took a share of his false fees, true enough! And that bridge contract went to my cousin, though his work is shoddy!" One by one, the councilmen who tasted the bread confessed their own petty dishonesties and secret dealings.

The townspeople, listening at the door, grew angrier still. They ran the disgraced Mayor and councilmen out of town, along with the ruined Guild Master. They then chose the baker, known for his honesty (and now, his strangely effective bread), to oversee the Guild fairly.

The baker prospered, but he used the Truth-Teller's Bread sparingly, remembering its power. He kept the recipe book hidden, knowing that truth, like bread, is best served rightly and not used for mischief. He paid fair prices for his flour and sold honest loaves, and the town beside the river thrived once more.
