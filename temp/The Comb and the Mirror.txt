In a lady's chamber lay a fine ivory comb and a small hand-mirror with a silver frame. One morning, the comb, having just smoothed the lady's hair, sat preening itself in a sunbeam.

‘See how useful I am!’ said the comb to the mirror. ‘I take the tangled locks and make them smooth and orderly. Without me, the lady would look quite wild.’

The mirror remained silent, reflecting the sunbeam.

‘And I am beautiful too,’ continued the comb, waggling its teeth slightly. ‘My ivory is white and polished, each tooth perfectly formed. You, mirror, only show what is put before you. You have no beauty of your own.’

The mirror still said nothing, but reflected the proud comb.

Just then, the lady returned in haste, seeking her gloves. In her hurry, she knocked the comb from the table. It fell to the hard floor, and two of its fine teeth snapped off.

‘Alas!’ cried the comb. ‘Look what has happened! I am ruined!’

The mirror reflected the broken comb lying on the floor.

‘And you,’ wept the comb, ‘you just show my misfortune! You are cruel.’

‘I show only what is,’ the mirror reflected silently, as the maid came in and swept the broken comb away with the dust.
