There was a kingdom where the king and queen dearly wished for a child. They consulted physicians and wise women, but years passed, and the queen remained childless. One day, walking sadly in the royal gardens, the queen rested her hand upon a smooth, grey garden statue of a young boy playing pipes, worn by time and weather. "Oh, stone child," she sighed aloud, "if only you were real, I would love you as my own son, even if you kept your stony heart."

Her words, spoken with deep longing beside the ancient statue, held an unwitting magic. That night, the queen dreamed the statue stepped down from its pedestal. When she awoke, the statue was indeed gone from the garden. And in the royal nursery, sleeping peacefully in the cradle, lay a baby boy. He was beautiful, but his skin had a faint grey, smooth coolness, like polished stone, and though he breathed and moved, he never cried, never smiled, never showed any flicker of emotion. His heart, as the queen had wished, was like stone.

They named him Florian. He grew into a handsome young prince, strong and skilled in all princely arts – riding, swordsmanship, languages. He obeyed every command perfectly, learned every lesson instantly, but his face remained a mask, his eyes distant. He felt no joy, no sorrow, no anger, no love. He was dutiful, but cold. The king and queen loved him dearly, but grieved for the son whose heart remained stone.

Word of the Stone Prince spread. Neighbouring kingdoms whispered about the emotionless heir. When Florian came of age, no princess wished to marry him, fearing a life beside living marble.

One day, a travelling storyteller came to the court. She told tales of faraway lands, enchantments, and quests. Afterwards, Florian approached her, his voice calm and even as always. "Storyteller," he asked, "in your tales, are there ever cures for enchantments of the heart?"

The storyteller looked closely at the handsome, cold prince. "There are legends, Your Highness," she said softly. "They speak of the Sunken City beneath the Silent Lake, where the Tear-stone Mirror lies hidden. It is said this mirror does not reflect one's face, but one's truest, deepest feelings. But the City is guarded, and the Lake gives up its secrets grudgingly."

For the first time, a flicker of something – perhaps curiosity, perhaps a logical assessment of a potential solution – crossed Florian's face. He resolved to seek this Mirror. He asked no one's permission, simply equipped himself plainly, left a note of his intention, and departed for the Silent Lake, which lay many leagues distant through wild country.

He journeyed for weeks, facing hardships with stoic indifference. Bandits attacked; he disarmed them with cool efficiency, feeling no fear or anger. He went hungry; it was merely a state to be endured. He saw beauty in sunsets and landscapes; he noted it as data, feeling no awe.

At last, he reached the Silent Lake, a vast, unnaturally still body of water surrounded by dark cliffs. There was no boat. Following the legend the storyteller hinted at, Florian knew he must enter the water willingly. He walked into the cold lake without hesitation. The water closed over his head, yet he found he could breathe as if in air.

Beneath the surface, the water was clear, revealing the ghostly outlines of the Sunken City – towers and archways covered in silt and weed. Strange, silent fish drifted through ruined doorways. As he descended towards the largest central dome, ghostly figures formed from the lake water – the Water Guardians. They barred his path, their forms shifting, their silent challenge radiating despair and loss – emotions Florian could not feel.

He tried to push past them, but they reformed instantly. He drew his sword, but it passed through them harmlessly. They did not attack, merely blocked, their silent sorrow an impassable barrier to anyone who could feel it. But Florian felt nothing. Their despair washed over him like water itself, having no effect on his stone heart. He simply walked *through* them. Their forms swirled and dissipated around him, unable to gain purchase on his emotionless state.

He reached the central dome and entered. Inside, resting on a dais, was a large, circular mirror framed in coral and pearl. Its surface was not reflective silver, but swirled with milky, shifting colours. The Tear-stone Mirror.

Florian stood before it. He expected to see… nothing. He felt nothing, so surely the Mirror would remain blank? He looked into its depths.

At first, nothing happened. Then, slowly, shapes began to form in the milky colours. He saw not his own feelings, but the feelings *directed at him*. He saw his mother's desperate longing when she spoke to the statue. He saw his father's quiet grief at his coldness. He saw the storyteller's pity. He saw the fear in the eyes of the princesses who refused him. He saw the bandits' fleeting anger. He saw the villagers' distant awe and slight unease. All the emotions he could not feel himself were reflected back at him, focused upon him by the Mirror.

It was overwhelming. A lifetime of unfelt love, sorrow, fear, and hope crashed into his awareness. His stone heart, unable to process the sudden flood, cracked. A physical, audible *crack* echoed in the silent dome. Pain, sharp and real, lanced through him – the first true feeling he had ever known. It was quickly followed by sorrow for the grief he caused, love for the parents who endured, fear of the emptiness within him, hope that this crack meant change.

Tears – real, hot tears – streamed down his face, mingling with the water of the lake. As his first tear struck the surface of the Mirror, it shimmered violently. The reflected images vanished, replaced by his own face, no longer a cold mask, but alive with confusion, pain, and burgeoning hope. His skin lost its stony coolness, gaining warmth and colour.

The Mirror had shown him not his own feelings, but the feelings of others *about* him, and that reflection had been enough to break the stone enchantment born of his mother's wish.

He left the Sunken City, the Water Guardians no longer hindering him (perhaps sensing his newfound feeling), and emerged from the Silent Lake, gasping for air like a newborn. He returned to his kingdom, no longer the Stone Prince, but simply Florian, a young man capable of joy, sorrow, and love, ready at last to truly live.
