There was once a pedlar who travelled the roads with trinkets and trifles. He was a cheerful soul, but sometimes lonely. One rainy evening, seeking shelter, he stumbled upon a tiny, moss-covered hut he had never seen before, tucked away beneath an old oak. Inside sat a little old woman, no bigger than a mushroom, weaving rushes by the firelight.

"Good evening, Mother," said the pedlar, shaking the rain from his coat. "Might I rest by your fire till the storm passes?"

The little woman looked up, her eyes like bright beads. "Aye, pedlar, sit you down. But travellers pay for warmth with a story or a song."

The pedlar had few stories and a poor voice for singing. He looked through his pack. "I have no song," he said, "but perhaps a trade? A bright ribbon? A tin whistle?"

The little woman waved them away. "Nay. But I see you have a plain brown hat. Give me the hat, and you may stay the night."

The pedlar hesitated, for it was his only hat against sun and rain. But the fire was warm, and the hut dry. "Very well," he said, handing it over.

The little woman took the hat. She pulled three strands of silvery thread from her basket â€“ one like moonlight, one like starlight, one like sunlight. With quick fingers, she wove them into the hatband, humming a strange tune. She handed it back. "Wear this now, pedlar man," she chuckled. "It has a touch of magic in its span."

The pedlar thanked her and put the hat on. It felt no different. He spent a warm night by the fire and left in the morning, the rain having stopped. As he walked down the path, a farmer passed him on a donkey. "Good day to you, friend!" called the farmer.

The pedlar opened his mouth to reply "Good day," but instead out came: "Good day, the sky is **grey**, I hope you go the proper **way**!"

The farmer stared. The pedlar clapped a hand to his mouth, bewildered. He tried to say, "A fine morning," but instead said: "A fine **day**, come what **may**!"

He realized with horror that the hat was making him speak only in rhymes! He tried to take it off, but it seemed stuck fast to his head. He walked on, dreading meeting anyone else. He needed to sell his wares in the next village.

He reached the village market. A woman stopped by his stall. "How much for this lace?" she asked.

The pedlar tried to say "Three pennies," but out popped: "For lace so **white**, the price is **right**, three pennies makes it yours **tonight**!"

The woman laughed. "Tonight? It's barely noon! But your rhymes are merry. I'll take it!" She paid him, still chuckling.

A man asked the price of a knife. The pedlar groaned inwardly, then declared: "This knife so **keen**, the best I've **seen**, will cost you sir, just **fifteen**!" (He meant five).

"Fifteen!" cried the man. "Too much!" But the pedlar's rhyming style drew a small crowd. People were amused. They asked him questions just to hear his rhyming answers.
"What news from the road, pedlar?"
"The road is **long**, the world goes **wrong**, but still I sing my silly **song**!"
"Is your donkey well?" (He had no donkey).
"My donkey **bright**, sleeps well at **night**, he's never caused me any **fright**!"

He sold more trinkets that day than he had all week, though his prices were often confused by the rhymes. People bought things just for the fun of hearing him speak. By evening, his pack was much lighter, and his purse heavier, but his head ached from constant rhyming.

He left the village, desperate to remove the hat. He pulled, he tugged, but it would not budge. He sat by the roadside in despair. "Oh, hat, you bring me **trouble**, my poor words you **double**!" he lamented.

Just then, the little old woman from the hut appeared beside him, as if from nowhere. "Not trouble, pedlar," she said, her eyes twinkling. "Just a different tune. Did you sell your wares?"

"Aye," sighed the pedlar, "but this rhyming **flows**, wherever my poor head **goes**!"

"Sometimes," said the little woman, "a change of tune is what the world needs. But perhaps you've rhymed enough for one day." She tapped the hat three times. It instantly felt loose. The pedlar snatched it off his head with relief.

"Keep the hat," she said. "But wear it only when you wish for rhymes. Now, give me a smile for my trouble."

The pedlar, free from the rhymes, gave her a wide, grateful smile. The little woman chuckled again and vanished like mist. The pedlar looked at the hat, then tucked it carefully into his pack. He walked on towards the setting sun, speaking plain words once more, but feeling perhaps the world was a little more whimsical than he had thought.
