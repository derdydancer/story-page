Baron Von Hess was a man whose appetite was as large as his estate, which is to say, enormous. He consumed roasted oxen, wheels of cheese, and barrels of wine, yet his hunger was never truly satisfied. His cooks despaired, for nothing seemed rich enough, rare enough, or plentiful enough. "More!" was the Baron's constant cry.

One day, a travelling mountebank came to the castle, promising wonders. The Baron, hoping for some new delicacy, summoned him. "What marvels can you offer my jaded palate?" he boomed.

The mountebank, a thin fellow with eyes that darted about, bowed low. "Noble Baron," he said slyly, "I possess a secret recipe, learned from the cloud-herders of the highest peaks. It allows one to capture and consume... the wind itself!"

The Baron stared. "Eat the wind? Preposterous!"

"Not preposterous, Your Excellency, but exquisite! Imagine! The freshness of the North Wind, the spice of the East Wind, the gentle balm of the South Wind, the wild freedom of the West Wind! A feast that fills without bloating, satisfies without surfeit!"

The Baron, intrigued by the sheer novelty and the promise of endless satisfaction, demanded the recipe. The mountebank named a high price – a bag of gold and the Baron's second-best horse. The greedy Baron paid immediately. The mountebank whispered the "secret":

"Atop the highest tower, when the chosen wind blows strong, hold open this Enchanted Bellows (he produced a small, oddly shimmering bellows) and draw the wind in thrice. Then, quickly seal the nozzle with this Stopper of Stillness (a plug of what looked like dark wax). When you desire to feast, unstopper the bellows slightly into a silver bowl. The captured wind will appear as a shimmering vapour. Inhale it deeply. Utter satisfaction!"

The mountebank pocketed his gold, took the horse, and departed hastily.

The Baron, eager for this new sensation, waited impatiently for the North Wind to blow fiercely. When it howled around the battlements, he climbed the highest tower, clutching the Enchanted Bellows and the Stopper of Stillness. He pointed the bellows northwards, worked the handles thrice, drawing in the biting wind, and quickly sealed it.

Back in his dining hall, he dismissed his cooks. He held the bellows over a silver bowl and carefully removed the Stopper of Stillness just a crack. A wisp of cold, shimmering vapour curled into the bowl. The Baron bent over and inhaled deeply.

An extraordinary sensation filled him! It was like swallowing snowflakes and ice, sharp, bracing, exhilarating! He felt utterly full, yet light as air. "Magnificent!" he roared.

Over the next days, he captured and consumed all four winds. The spicy East Wind tasted of distant deserts and unknown blossoms. The gentle South Wind felt like warm milk and sunshine. The wild West Wind tasted of salt spray and freedom. He needed no other food. His cooks were dismissed, his pantry grew dusty. The Baron spent his days inhaling vapours from his Enchanted Bellows, feeling wonderfully full and strangely light.

But the lightness grew. He found his feet barely touched the ground when he walked. A strong breeze could lift him several inches off the floor. He had to wear lead weights in his pockets to keep from floating away. His great belly, once vast, seemed unchanged, yet he felt... hollow, filled only with air and echoes. The satisfaction was real, but it pushed out everything else.

One afternoon, standing on his balcony, he uncorked the bellows for a taste of the West Wind. A sudden, powerful gust swept across the land. It caught the Baron, light as a bubble from his airy diet, and lifted him right off the balcony! The lead weights were not enough!

He floated upwards, clutching the useless bellows, crying out in alarm. Higher and higher he drifted, a comical, portly figure rising into the blue sky like a runaway balloon. His cries grew fainter. The villagers watched, mouths agape, as Baron Von Hess, who had desired to eat the wind, was carried away by it, never to be seen again. His castle stood empty, a testament to an appetite that consumed even substance itself, leaving only emptiness to be swept away. The mountebank, miles away, chuckled as he rode the Baron's horse, knowing the "Enchanted Bellows" was just an ordinary bellows, and the "Stopper" just wax – the Baron's own greed and imagination had done the rest.
