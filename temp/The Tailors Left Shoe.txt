There once was a tailor named Simon, known for his fine stitching but also for his sharp tongue and tendency to cheat his customers just a little â€“ an extra inch of cloth kept here, a lesser quality thread used there. He lived alone, save for a cat, and counted his coins each night with satisfaction.

One winter, a poor widow came to him, needing a sturdy pair of shoes for her son who had to walk miles to chop wood. She gave Simon her last silver piece and a good piece of leather she had saved for years. "Make them strong and true, Master Tailor," she pleaded. "His old ones let in the snow."

Simon, seeing the quality of the leather, made the right shoe perfectly well, strong and tightly stitched. But for the left shoe, his greed got the better of him. He used thinner thread, weaker stitches hidden on the inside, and even stretched the leather slightly so he could keep a small scrap for himself. He gave the pair to the widow, assuring her they were the finest work.

The boy wore the shoes. The right one held up admirably, but the left one soon began to leak. Stitches popped, the sole loosened, and the boy's foot was always cold and damp. One freezing day, struggling home through deep snow, the left shoe failed entirely. The boy stumbled, fell into a hidden drift, and took a chill so deep he fell gravely ill. The widow wept, blaming Simon's shoddy work.

She went to confront the tailor, but Simon, seeing her coming, quickly hid the leftover scrap of leather and denied everything. "My work is perfect!" he declared. "Your son must have misused the shoes! Be gone, woman!" He slammed the door in her face.

That night, a strange thing happened. As Simon slept, the ruined left shoe, which the widow had thrown down in despair outside his shop, began to twitch. A single loose thread stiffened like a wire. The worn sole tapped on the cobblestones. Slowly, awkwardly, the empty leather shoe began to hop, hop, hopping through the deserted streets.

It hopped to the Mayor's house and tapped on the door until a sleepy servant answered. The shoe hopped inside, straight into the Mayor's study, and hopped onto his desk, right beside his inkwell. It then hopped *into* the inkwell, soaking its tattered sole, and hopped back out, leaving a clear, black footprint on an important town document. Then it hopped away.

Next, the shoe hopped to the house of the richest merchant in town, known for his vanity. It hopped up onto his window ledge, where his prize-winning white cat slept. The shoe nudged the cat gently until it awoke, then hopped down, leaving a faint trail of inky water. The startled cat, curious, followed the trail, leaving its own paw prints alongside the shoe's path, leading away from the merchant's house.

Finally, the shoe hopped back to Simon's shop. It hopped onto his cutting table, where lay the scrap of fine leather Simon had stolen from the widow. The shoe dipped its inky sole again (using the last dregs from its journey) and hopped squarely onto the centre of the leather scrap, leaving one final, damning footprint. Then, its task seemingly done, it hopped into a dark corner and lay still.

The next morning, chaos erupted. The Mayor found the footprint on his document and roared for the town watch. The merchant found his prize cat missing (it had followed the shoe's trail out of town and got lost) and accused his rivals of theft, pointing to the strange prints. But the widow, seeing the commotion, went to the Mayor. "That footprint," she said, holding up the boy's sturdy right shoe, "looks like the sole of my son's shoe! The left one, made by Simon the Tailor, failed him!"

The Mayor, the merchant, and the watch marched to Simon's shop. Simon denied everything, blustering and shouting. But the Mayor spotted the cutting table. There lay the scrap of fine leather, and upon it, clear as day, was the inky footprint of a left shoe, identical to the one on his document and matching the widow's right shoe.

Simon turned pale. He could not explain the leather scrap or the footprint. His lies caught up with him. Faced with the evidence, he confessed his deceit.

The Mayor ordered Simon to pay the widow compensation enough to care for her sick son (who eventually recovered) and to buy him three pairs of the finest shoes. Simon's reputation was ruined, his customers left him, and he lived out his days patching worn clothes, his fine tailoring skills wasted, forever remembering the night a single, ruined shoe hopped through the town to deliver justice. The left shoe itself was never seen again; perhaps it hopped away satisfied, or perhaps it simply fell apart into dust and thread in its dark corner.
