In a kingdom renowned for its gleaming castles and polished floors, there lived a Princess named Amalia. Unlike other princesses who collected jewels or suitors, Amalia collected dust.

Not great clumps of grime, mind you, but the fine, shimmering dust that settled on forgotten windowsills or danced in sunbeams. She kept it in little crystal jars, labelled meticulously: "Sunbeam Dust - East Tower," "Velvet Curtain Dust - Ballroom," "Forgotten Book Dust - Library." Her father the King, and her mother the Queen, thought it most peculiar, but Amalia was gentle and caused no trouble, so they let her be.

One day, a neighbouring King, very rich and powerful, but whose kingdom was notoriously dull and grey, sent an envoy. "My master, King Borin, wishes to wed the Princess Amalia," announced the envoy stiffly. "He offers riches beyond measure."

Amalia's parents were pleased, but Amalia wrinkled her nose. "Is his castle dusty?" she asked.

The envoy looked aghast. "His Majesty's castle is spotless! Cleaned daily by a hundred servants!"

"Then I shall not go," said Amalia firmly. "It sounds terribly boring."

Her parents despaired. King Borin was not one to be refused lightly. They pleaded with Amalia. At last, she said, "Very well. I shall set King Borin a task. If he can bring me three handfuls of Truly Interesting Dust, gathered from his own kingdom, I shall consider his suit."

The envoy returned to King Borin with this strange request. King Borin scoffed. "Dust? Interesting dust? Nonsense! But fetch me some dust, any dust!"

Servants swept the cleanest corners of the castle and brought King Borin three silk bags filled with ordinary grey dust. He sent these to Princess Amalia.

Amalia opened the bags, peered at the contents, and sneezed. "This is just common floor dust," she declared. "Utterly uninteresting. Tell King Borin he has failed."

King Borin was furious. He sent his envoy back. "Tell the Princess," he roared, "that *she* must come here and find this 'Interesting Dust' herself! If she fails within three days, she marries me anyway!"

Amalia, surprisingly, agreed. "Perhaps his kingdom is not entirely dull if it requires searching," she mused. She packed a small bag, including several empty crystal jars.

She arrived in King Borin's grey kingdom. Everything was swept, scrubbed, and grey. King Borin met her, impatient. "Well? Find your dust, Princess!"

Amalia wandered through the spotless castle. No sunbeam dust, no velvet dust. She went into the grey town. The streets were swept bare. She sighed. On the second day, she walked out into the countryside. It too seemed grey and orderly. She sat sadly by a grey stone wall.

Then she noticed something. Tucked into a crevice in the wall was a tiny, bright blue flower she had never seen before. Beside it, clinging to the stone, was a minuscule dusting of pollen, bright blue like the flower. "Aha!" she whispered. Carefully, she collected the Blue Pollen Dust into a tiny jar. "Flower Dust - Stone Wall," she labelled it. That was *one* interesting dust.

She walked further and came to a cave hidden behind some grey bushes. Inside, the walls glittered faintly. Tiny, almost invisible sparks seemed to drift in the air. She held out a jar, and slowly, some of the glittering specks settled inside. They glowed dimly. "Cave Spark Dust," she labelled it. *Two* interesting dusts.

The third day dawned. She needed one more. She climbed a windswept, grey hill. At the very top stood a single, gnarled, ancient tree, struck long ago by lightning. Its bark was charred black. Amalia felt drawn to it. She touched the blackened bark. A fine, silvery-black powder came off on her fingers. It shimmered oddly in the grey light. "Lightning Tree Dust," she murmured, carefully collecting it. *Three* interesting dusts.

She returned to King Borin's castle just as the third day ended. She presented her three small jars. King Borin peered at them suspiciously. "This is dust?"

"This," said Amalia, holding up the first jar, "is Blue Pollen Dust from a flower hiding in your walls. This," showing the second, "is Cave Spark Dust that glows in the dark. And this," showing the third, "is Lightning Tree Dust from the ancient tree on the hill."

King Borin looked from the jars to the Princess. He saw the blue flower dust, the glowing spark dust, the shimmering lightning dust. He looked around his grey, spotless castle, and his grey town. He had never noticed flowers in walls, or glowing caves, or ancient lightning-struck trees. He had only seen things to be cleaned or controlled.

Suddenly, his kingdom felt terribly boring, just as the Princess had said. He looked at Amalia, who was gazing fondly at her dust jars.

"Princess," King Borin said slowly, "you have found interest where I saw none. You have shown me my kingdom is not entirely grey. Keep your dusts. You... you do not have to marry me. Perhaps you could... tell me more about this Lightning Tree?"

Amalia smiled. She did not marry King Borin, but she stayed for a week, showing him the hidden flower, the sparking cave, and the ancient tree. King Borin learned to see the little bits of colour and wonder in his own grey land. And Princess Amalia returned home with three jars of the most interesting dust she had ever collected.
