In a village known for its fine linen lived a woman named Agnes. She was neither rich nor poor, hardworking at her loom, but possessed of one great fault: she loved to gossip more than she loved her own supper. No secret was safe with her, no rumour left unstirred, no reputation left unsullied by her wagging tongue. If she heard a whisper at the well, it became a shout at the market. If she saw a neighbour stumble, she told the village he was a drunkard. Her words were like nettles, stinging harmless folk for her own sour amusement.

Her husband, a quiet man named Thomas, often sighed, "Agnes, hold your tongue. Such sharp words will bring you sorrow."

"Nonsense!" Agnes would retort. "Words are only air. What harm can they do?" And she would hurry off to share the latest tidbit she had embroidered with malice.

One afternoon, Agnes sat spinning with her neighbours. The talk turned to the miller's daughter, a shy girl named Clara, who was soon to be wed. Agnes leaned in conspiratorially. "Have you heard," she whispered loudly, though Clara's own cousin sat nearby, "that the bridegroom only offered for her because his first choice, the blacksmith's girl, refused him flat? And they say Clara..." Agnes paused for effect, then launched into a cruel and entirely fabricated tale about Clara's character.

The cousin gasped, tears welling in her eyes, and fled the room. The other women looked down, suddenly ashamed to be listening. But Agnes felt a thrill of importance.

That night, however, Agnes awoke with a strange feeling in her mouth. It was dry, scratchy, and oddly full. She went to get a drink of water, but found she could barely swallow. Alarmed, she went to the small looking-glass she owned. When she opened her mouth to see what was wrong, she screamed, but no sound came out. Her tongue was gone. In its place, crammed into her mouth, was a clump of sharp, prickly, purple-flowered thistles.

She tried frantically to pull them out, but the thorns dug into the roof of her mouth and the sides of her cheeks, drawing blood. Each time she tugged, the thistles seemed to grip tighter, the thorns sink deeper. She could not speak, she could not eat, she could barely drink. Water trickled painfully past the prickly mass.

Thomas found her weeping silently, pointing desperately at her mouth. When he saw the thistles, he understood at once. "Alas, Agnes!" he cried, remembering her cruel gossip about poor Clara. "Your sharp words have borne bitter fruit! Your tongue has become what it dispensed – thorns and thistles!"

Agnes lived in misery. She grew thin and weak, unable to eat solid food. She could only communicate through gestures and sorrowful eyes. When she tried to gesture gossip, pointing fingers and mimicking whispers, the thistles in her mouth seemed to prickle even more fiercely. She could no longer sit with the neighbours, for they pitied and slightly feared her. The silence she had despised in others became her own prison.

She began to spend her days alone, tending a small patch of herbs behind their cottage. One day, weeding amongst the mint and thyme, she saw shy Clara pass by on the lane, looking pale and drawn. Remorse washed over Agnes. She longed to apologize, to take back her poisonous words, but she could make no sound. On impulse, she quickly gathered a small bunch of her sweetest smelling thyme and offered it to Clara with a look of deep regret in her eyes.

Clara hesitated, then seeing Agnes's genuine sorrow and her terrible affliction, she softened. She accepted the herbs with a small, sad smile and went on her way.

As Agnes watched her go, she felt a slight easing in her mouth. It wasn't much, but one of the sharpest thistle thorns seemed to retract slightly. Hope flickered within her. Could kindness undo the curse?

From that day, Agnes changed her ways entirely. Unable to speak gossip, she began to *do* kindness. She left anonymous bundles of firewood for the old widow. She mended clothes for the orphans. She shared her herbs freely. She offered silent comfort to those in sorrow. And whenever she saw someone she had wronged with her past words, she would offer them a small, humble gift – a flower, a polished pebble, a piece of bread saved from her own meagre, liquid diet – her eyes conveying the apology she could not speak.

Slowly, painstakingly, with each act of genuine kindness and contrition, the thistles in her mouth began to recede. A sharp leaf would wither, a thorn would soften and fall away. It took many seasons, but eventually, one morning, Agnes awoke and felt something different. Hesitantly, she looked in the glass. The last vestige of the thistles was gone, and in its place was a small, pink, ordinary tongue.

She touched it carefully. "Hello?" she whispered. Her voice was weak and rusty from disuse, but it was hers. Tears of gratitude streamed down her face.

Agnes never returned to her gossiping ways. Her tongue, once a weapon, now spoke only quiet, necessary, and kindly words. And the villagers learned to hold their own tongues, remembering the woman whose gossip had literally filled her mouth with thorns.
