King Theodore the Tremendous was a good king, fair and just, but he possessed one great vanity: his magnificent beard. It was long, glossy, and black as a raven's wing, flowing down to his ample belly. He brushed it one hundred strokes each morning and slept with it tucked into a special silken bag. The Royal Beard-Comber was one of the most important positions at court.

One afternoon, Fumblemore the Forgetful, the court wizard (kept mostly for predicting rain and finding lost spectacles), was demonstrating a new spell. It was supposed to turn turnips into teacups. Fumblemore waved his wand, chanted, "Abraca-turnip, teacup-a-zam!" but he tripped over his own long robes at the crucial moment. The wand flew sideways, a puff of purple smoke shot out, and instead of hitting the turnip, it hit King Theodore squarely on the chin.

Poof! The King's magnificent beard vanished utterly. Not a whisker remained. His chin, unseen for thirty years, was revealed to be round, pink, and surprisingly small.

There was a shocked silence in the throne room. Fumblemore gasped, "Oh dear. Wrong... target." The King let out a strangled cry, feeling his smooth chin. Then he roared, a sound that rattled the stained-glass windows. "My beard! Wizard, you clumsy oaf! Find my beard! Restore it at once!"

But Fumblemore, terrified, grabbed his turnip and vanished himself in another, less accurate puff of smoke, leaving behind only a faint smell of singed parsnip.

The King was distraught. He couldn't rule! He couldn't feast! He couldn't even look in a mirror without weeping! What would the neighbouring kingdoms say? How could he lead his knights with a chin like a baby bird's?

"No one must see!" he declared. He locked himself in his chambers. He ordered the Royal Beard-Comber (now unemployed) to fetch him disguises. First, they tried tying a large black silk scarf around his lower face. He looked like a bandit with a toothache. Then, they tried a false beard made of goat hair. It was scratchy and smelled faintly of cheese. Next, a beard fashioned from raven feathers. It tickled his nose and shed feathers whenever he spoke. He tried simply holding a royal proclamation permanently in front of his chin, but it made eating soup impossible.

Desperate, the King decided he must find Fumblemore. Disguised in the goat-hair beard and a floppy peasant's hat, he slipped out of the castle by a side gate. He asked passers-by if they had seen a forgetful wizard smelling faintly of singed parsnip.

He followed rumour and hearsay. A farmer said Fumblemore had tried to turn his scarecrow into a serving maid, resulting only in a scarecrow wearing an apron. A baker reported Fumblemore had accidentally enchanted his loaves to sing sea shanties, causing much confusion. A goose-girl claimed he'd turned the pond green and the geese orange for an hour.

The King, growing increasingly itchy under his false beard, trailed Fumblemore across the kingdom. He arrived at a windmill just as Fumblemore was attempting to magically speed up the sails. Instead, the windmill shuddered, groaned, and began slowly spinning backwards. Fumblemore sighed, scratching his head.

"Wizard!" croaked the King, forgetting his disguise in his frustration.

Fumblemore jumped, saw the goat-bearded figure, and yelped, "Your Majesty! Er... lovely disguise! Very... rustic!"

"Never mind the disguise, Fumblemore!" snapped the King. "My beard! Reverse the spell!"

"Ah," said Fumblemore, wringing his hands. "The Beard-Be-Gone hex. Tricky reversal. Needs a specific counter-charm. Requires... yes... the tear of a laughing onion, the sigh of a contented teapot, and precisely three red hairs from a badger that knows multiplication."

The King stared. "Are you jesting, wizard?"

"Alas, no, Your Majesty," sighed Fumblemore. "Magic is specific. Especially accidental magic."

So began another quest. The King, still disguised, and the wizard travelled together. Finding a laughing onion involved telling it jokes until it wept tears of mirth (which took two days and many bad puns). Capturing the sigh of a contented teapot required brewing the perfect cup of tea and listening very closely with a special funnel Fumblemore fashioned from a cabbage leaf. Finding the badger was hardest. They finally located one near an old scholar's cottage. Fumblemore tried asking it multiplication questions ("What's three times four, old fellow?"), but the badger just blinked. At last, the King, exasperated, simply offered the badger a piece of honey-cake. While the badger munched contentedly, the King quickly plucked three reddish hairs from its flank.

They returned to the castle with the ingredients. Fumblemore mixed them in a bowl, chanted, "Beardius Returnius, Follicle-Grow-Glorious!" and dabbed the concoction on the King's chin.

Slowly, miraculously, the beard began to grow back. Inch by inch, glossy and black, it flowed forth until it was restored to its full, magnificent glory. The King wept with joy, stroking it fondly.

He looked at Fumblemore, who beamed nervously. "Well done, wizard," the King said, surprisingly calm now his beard was back. "You are still forgetful, and clumsy, but you fixed it. Now... about those turnips..."

King Theodore kept Fumblemore as his court wizard, though he made him practice his spells only in the turnip patch. And the King, while still proud of his beard, perhaps held it a little less tightly, remembering the itchy goat hair and the kindness of a badger with a sweet tooth.
