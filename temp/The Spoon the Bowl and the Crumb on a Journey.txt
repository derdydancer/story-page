In a kitchen cupboard, there lived a Wooden Spoon, an Earthenware Bowl, and a little Dry Crumb of bread. They sat together day after day. The Spoon leaned against the Bowl, and the Crumb nestled inside the Bowl.

One day, the Bowl sighed (which sounded like a faint *clink*). "Oh, Spoon," it said, "I am weary of this dark cupboard. I wish to see the Wide World."

"Indeed," creaked the Spoon. "My handle aches for adventure. Let us go!"

"And I," squeaked the tiny Crumb from the bottom of the Bowl, "I wish to see where I came from! Perhaps we shall find the Great Loaf!"

So they decided to set out. But how? The Bowl could not walk, the Spoon could only lie flat, and the Crumb was too small to travel alone.

"Wait," clinked the Bowl. "Spoon, if you lie down, I can roll onto your flat part. Crumb, you stay inside me. Then, if we tilt just so..."

It was a clumsy plan. The Spoon lay down. The Bowl rolled awkwardly onto the Spoon's handle. The Crumb bounced about inside. By shifting and wobbling, they managed to tip themselves off the edge of the cupboard shelf. Clatter! Bump! They landed on the kitchen floor.

"Huzzah!" creaked the Spoon, though slightly splintered. "We are free!"

They needed to cross the vast stone floor to reach the Back Door, which they could see slightly ajar, showing a glimpse of the Green Garden.

"How shall we cross?" clinked the Bowl nervously. "The floor is so wide."

"I have an idea," squeaked the Crumb. "Wait here." And the little Crumb rolled away towards the Hearth, where some stray bits of kindling lay. It pushed with all its might against a long, thin wood shaving. Slowly, the shaving moved. The Crumb pushed it back towards the others. "Spoon," it squeaked, "lie flat again. Bowl, roll onto the Spoon. I shall push the shaving under you like a roller!"

It was slow work. The Crumb pushed the shaving, the Spoon wobbled with the Bowl on top, and inch by inch, they moved across the floor. Suddenly, a shadow fell over them. It was the House Cat, sleek and black, with eyes like green glass.

"Meeow?" it questioned, batting curiously at the Spoon's end.

"Quick!" clinked the Bowl in terror. "Tip us!"

They wobbled violently. The Bowl rolled off the Spoon, landing upside down, trapping the Crumb safely beneath it. The Spoon lay still, pretending to be mere wood. The Cat sniffed the upturned Bowl, batted the Spoon again, lost interest, and sauntered away.

"Phew," creaked the Spoon when the danger was past. The Bowl righted itself. The Crumb emerged, trembling. "That was close," it squeaked.

They continued their slow journey, pushed by the Crumb on the shaving-roller. At last, they reached the Back Door. It was open just enough for them to squeeze through.

Outside, the Green Garden seemed enormous. Giant blades of grass towered over them. A monstrous Worm wriggled past. A busy Ant carrying a seed bumped into the Bowl. "Beg pardon," buzzed the Ant, and hurried on.

"The Wide World is very... wide," clinked the Bowl uncertainly.

"And full of strange folk," creaked the Spoon.

"But where is the Great Loaf?" squeaked the Crumb, looking about the vast greenness.

Just then, a small brown Sparrow hopped down from a bush. It eyed the little Crumb keenly. Before the Spoon or Bowl could react, the Sparrow darted forward, plucked up the Dry Crumb in its beak, and flew away.

"Crumb!" clinked the Bowl in dismay.

"Alas!" creaked the Spoon sadly.

They sat there, the Wooden Spoon and the Earthenware Bowl, alone in the big garden. The adventure felt less grand now. The Wide World was perhaps too wide, and too full of hungry birds.

"Spoon," sighed the Bowl after a long silence. "Perhaps the cupboard was not so bad after all."

"Indeed," creaked the Spoon. "It was quiet. And safe."

They did not know how to get back. So they just stayed there in the garden. Perhaps the gardener found them later and took them back inside. Or perhaps they are still out there, the Spoon leaning against the Bowl, remembering their little Dry Crumb and the day they journeyed into the Wide World.
