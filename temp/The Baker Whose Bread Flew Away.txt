There was once a baker named Otto whose bread was good, but not remarkable. He worked hard, yet his shop was always emptier than that of his rival across the street, whose loaves were lighter and whose rolls were said to be favoured by the Mayor himself. Otto grew envious and wished constantly for a way to make his bread the best in the land.

One evening, mixing his dough by the weak light of a candle, he muttered, "Oh, I wish my bread were so light it could almost fly!"

He thought nothing more of it, finished his work, and went to bed. The next morning, he awoke to a delicious smell filling his shop. He opened the oven, and pulled out a tray of the most beautiful, golden, perfectly risen loaves he had ever seen. They were incredibly light, almost weightless in his hands.

"My wish!" he breathed, astonished. "It came true!"

He eagerly placed the loaves in his shop window. The first customer of the day was the Mayor's wife. She gasped at the sight of the bread. "Otto! Such perfection! I must have that largest loaf!"

Otto beamed, carefully lifting the magnificent loaf. But as he handed it to her, a sudden gust of wind blew through the open shop door. The loaf, light as a feather, lifted from his hands! It sailed gently out the door, caught the breeze, and floated up, up, over the rooftops like a plump, golden cloud.

The Mayor's wife shrieked. Otto stared, dumbfounded. More customers arrived, drawn by the commotion and the wonderful smell. Each time Otto tried to sell a loaf or even a small roll, the slightest puff of air – a door opening, someone sighing too deeply, a fan fluttering – would send the baked good drifting away into the sky.

His bread was indeed the lightest in the land, lighter than air itself! It was magnificent, perfect, and utterly impossible to sell or eat. People crowded his shop not to buy, but to watch in amazement as rolls bobbed near the ceiling and loaves escaped out the window. His rival baker came over, laughing until tears streamed down his face.

Otto was distraught. His wish had been granted too well. He tried making heavier dough, adding stones to the mixture (which broke his customers' teeth and did not fly), but any bread made *correctly* simply floated away. He tried baking indoors with all windows and doors sealed, but the moment a customer opened the door to leave, their purchase would make a bid for freedom.

He grew poorer and poorer, known only as the baker whose bread flew away. His shop filled with cobwebs, not customers. One day, sitting glumly amidst the lingering scent of unattainable bread, he sighed a different kind of wish. "Oh, I wish I had just made good, honest, *heavy* bread that people could actually eat!"

No sooner had he spoken than a plain, brown sparrow flew in the window. It landed on his counter and chirped loudly. Then it flew to his flour bin, pecked at it, flew to his water jug, pecked at it, and flew to his yeast pot, chirping all the while. Otto watched, bewildered.

"Are you trying to tell me something, little bird?" he asked wearily.

The sparrow chirped insistently. On impulse, Otto decided to follow the bird's apparent instructions. He mixed the flour, water, and yeast in the proportions the sparrow seemed to indicate by its pecking and chirping. He kneaded the dough – it felt solid, substantial. He baked it.

Out of the oven came a loaf that was… ordinary. It was brown, dense, and smelled simply of honest bread. It did not gleam, it did not rise to magnificent heights, and most importantly, it did not float. Otto picked it up. It had weight.

He cautiously opened the door. A breeze blew in. The loaf stayed firmly in his hand. A customer peered in, saw the plain loaf, and asked, "Is that one for sale, Otto? Or will it fly to the moon?"

"This one stays," said Otto, feeling a tear of gratitude roll down his cheek. He sold the loaf. It was not the best bread in the land, but it was good, honest, and satisfyingly heavy.

From that day on, Otto baked only the sparrow's plain, heavy bread. His shop slowly filled again with customers who wanted bread they could eat, not bread that tickled the fancy of the wind. He never became famous, but he earned his living, and he learned that wishing for flighty perfection is less worthy than appreciating solid, earthly sustenance. And he always left crumbs out for the sparrows.
