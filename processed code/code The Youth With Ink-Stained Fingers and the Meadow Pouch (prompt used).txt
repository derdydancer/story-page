Thank you, great work. Now I want you to write a new essay on the exact same format but as you go along you need to come up with a new original story. 
Let each chapter consist of 10 sentences. 
Write 10 chapters, so there will be 100 sentence sections in total. 
DO NOT COME UP WITH THE PLOT OR TITLE OR SETTING OR ANYTHING AT ALL BEFORE STARTING WRITING. 
You as the author need to come up with the plot "as you go" writing this. 
However, I want you to do one thing differently this time: 
For each section (sentence) start by writing the analysis/explanation/commenatary of the sentence and then write the sentence last after these,
(plot function, grimm style, moral implication, metaphorical/psychological meaning, sentence). 
So the header will just be "Sentence 1 (Authors explanation and commentary): ". This way you will "plan out" the sentence before writing it. 

You must also adhere to the following guidelines: 
Main character is a failed art student in Vienna Austria

An unexpected but revealing plot twist, not revealed until chapter 3 (avoid deciding exactly what the secret will be until ch 3)

An unexpected but revealing plot twist, not revealed until chapter 6 (avoid deciding exactly what the secret will be until ch 6)

The Devil

Final reward is marrying the princess

DO NOT use any type of wise old woman figures. This story should concern male psychology at its core

Comedy

Repeated magical phrases or actions with slight variations each time

Character must watch over something for three consecutive nights

Pouch that contains an entire meadow accessible by reaching inside

Assign recurring descriptive phrases to major characters (e.g., 'swift-footed')

Create wisdom speeches from elder characters that reveal cultural values

Do not write an intruduction. Start with 
"Chapter 1"
"Sentence 1 (Authors explanation and commentary):"

Finally, write out the whole story exactly as stated.
