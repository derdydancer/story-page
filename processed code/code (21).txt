  "The Complete Story": {
    "Title": "The Cloud-Shearer",
    "Chapters": [
      "There was once a king who ruled over a large and prosperous kingdom. One morning, however, the people awoke to find that all the clouds had fallen out of the sky and lay upon the land like wet wool. Everything became damp and cold, and a thick white fog clung to everything, so that a man could scarce see his own hand before his face. The king could no longer go hunting, for the deer bumped into trees and the hounds chased their own tails in the fog, which made the king vexed. Now, there dwelt in that kingdom a miller's son who was not counted among the wisest folk. He went about touching the fallen clouds which clung to the hedges and fences, and said, \"Truly, the sky must need shearing, for its fleece lies thick upon the ground.\" The people laughed when they heard him, and called him the Cloud-Shearer thereafter. The king, growing weary of the dampness, sent heralds forth into every town and village with a proclamation. It declared that whosoever could clear the fallen clouds from the land would receive a great reward from the king's own hand. Many tried sweeping them, and drying them with fires, and carting them away, but none succeeded, for the clouds were endless and clung fast.",
      "Then the Cloud-Shearer took his mother's largest sewing scissors and went to the edge of the town where the clouds lay thickest upon a field. He began to snip at the damp white stuff, and though it seemed a foolish task, he snipped and snipped all day. As evening fell, a small man dressed all in grey stood beside him, though the youth had not heard him approach through the fog. The grey man looked at the tiny pile of snipped cloud, which was no bigger than a lamb's fleece, and asked, \"Why do you shear the fog, simpleton?\" \"The king wants them cleared,\" answered the miller's son, \"and shearing seems as good a way as any other.\" The grey man laughed aloud and said, \"Your scissors are too small! I have a better way, if you will strike a bargain with me.\" \"That I will,\" said the youth, \"if your way truly clears this field by morning, for my arms ache from shearing.\" The grey man stamped his little foot thrice, and a great wind arose that smelled of sulphur, and it whisked the clouds from that field until it was bare as a bone. \"There,\" said the grey man, \"it is done! Now, for my payment, you must give me the parings from your left thumbnail every Sunday for a year.\" \"A small price for clear field,\" thought the miller's son, and readily agreed, then ran to tell the king's steward that one field at least was cleared.",
      "The steward went to see, and finding the field truly clear, though all around was still thick fog, he gave the youth a purse of gold as the king had promised for such work. But the clearness did not spread, and the rest of the kingdom remained as damp and foggy as before. Every Sunday, the miller's son faithfully clipped the paring from his left thumbnail and left it under a hollow stump by the cleared field as agreed. Now, the king of the neighboring kingdom suffered the opposite trouble, for his land was dry as dust, his wells failed, and his crops withered on the stalk. He heard tell of the fallen clouds in the first kingdom, and thought that perhaps such damp stuff might be of some use to him. So he sent an envoy to the first king, saying he wished to buy wagon-loads of the fallen clouds if they could be gathered. The first king tore his hair, then laughed, saying, \"Buy my fog? Does he think clouds can be shovelled like dung? Still, perhaps...\" and he thought of the Cloud-Shearer. He summoned the miller's son, who came still looking bewildered by his purse of gold. \"Cloud-Shearer,\" said the king, hiding a smile, \"the king of the dry lands wishes to buy your harvest; see if you can gather him a wagon-load of clouds.\" The miller's son, thinking perhaps clouds could indeed be gathered now one field was clear, bowed and said, \"I shall try, lord king.\"",
      "He went back to the hollow stump by the cleared field, for he knew not how else clouds might be gathered, unless the grey man knew a trick for it. It being Sunday again, he clipped the paring from his left thumbnail and placed it carefully under the stump. The grey man appeared at once beside him and asked, \"What now, Cloud-Shearer? More fields to mow?\" \"Nay,\" said the youth, \"the king commands me to gather a wagon-load of these clouds to sell to the neighboring king whose land is too dry.\" The grey man laughed till tears ran down his face, crying, \"Selling fog by the pound! What will kings think of next? But I can manage that.\" He muttered strange words and waved his hands, and the clouds nearby grew solid and firm, rolling up into great white rounds like giant cheeses. \"There is your wagon-load,\" he said, pointing to three cloud-cheeses taller than the youth, \"but for this service, you must give me all your laughter for the next seven years.\" \"That is a sad price,\" said the miller's son, \"but the king commands, so I agree,\" for he did not think laughter was worth very much. And from that moment, try as he might, even when the steward later slipped on a damp patch, the miller's son could not laugh at all. He fetched his father's miller's cart and oxen, and with much pushing, rolled the three great cloud-cheeses onto it.",
      "He journeyed for two days towards the dry kingdom, the cart rumbling behind him with its strange white load. Near the border, he saw the neighboring king's daughter walking by the roadside, looking sadly at the withered fields, and she was the most beautiful maiden he had ever beheld. She called out to him, \"Good fellow, what strange cheeses do you carry in this dry land?\" \"These are not cheeses, princess,\" said the miller's son, \"but clouds from my kingdom, which I bring to your father the king.\" The princess laughed merrily and replied, \"Clouds like cheese! Surely you jest, but carry on, your load is strange enough to be welcome.\" He reached the palace of the neighboring king and duly unloaded the three great cloud-cheeses in the dusty courtyard. The neighboring king was greatly pleased, for a cool dampness rose from them, and he gave the youth a heavy chest filled with silver coins. The cloud-cheeses kept the courtyard damp for a week, but the dampness did not spread, and soon the land was as dry as before. The miller's son returned to his own kingdom with the heavy chest of silver, yet he could not laugh to show his good fortune. His own king was pleased with the silver, calling it good trade, but remained puzzled that the fog remained as thick as ever.",
      "So the year passed, and the youth left his paring each Sunday, and people remarked how the once cheerful miller's son now never laughed. On the last Sunday of the year, when he went to the stump, the grey man was waiting for him. \"Payment received in full,\" said the grey man with a sly grin, \"and look what I have made with your contributions.\" He held up a thin grey rope, no thicker than a thread but surprisingly strong, which seemed woven from the tiny nail parings. \"With this rope,\" the Devil declared, \"made from a year of your own growth, I shall pull the sky down tightly to the earth and stop this foolish fog forever!\" The miller's son knew this would be worse than the dampness, for a sky pulled down tight would surely crush the kingdom flat. Before the Devil could act, the youth snatched out his mother's old sewing scissors and snipped the strange grey rope clean in two. The Devil howled like a scalded cat, for the rope snapped back and burned his fingers as if touching hot iron. There was a great sucking sound all across the land, and the fallen clouds flew upwards like milkweed seeds, back into the clear blue sky where the sun shone brightly. The Devil vanished in a puff of greasy smoke that smelled strongly of burnt wool, and was not seen again in that kingdom.",
      "As the smoke cleared, the miller's son felt a chuckle rise in his throat, and found he could laugh again heartily. Word reached the king how the miller's son had confronted the grey man and cut the Devil's rope, whereupon the clouds had returned to the sky. The king sent for him at once, no longer hiding his smile. \"Cloud-Shearer,\" said the king, \"your simple shearing proved wiser than all our plans! For your deed, I grant you stewardship over all the royal mills.\" Just then, the neighboring king sent his beautiful daughter back with thanks, and perhaps another proposal now that the weather was settled. The princess saw the miller's son standing beside the king, laughing heartily at some jest, and knew him at once. He saw her too, and this time, with no cloud-cheeses to deliver nor laughter to hide, he went boldly to greet her. The king saw how they looked upon each other, and mindful of the youth's deeds, his stewardship, and his chest of silver, he said, \"It seems a fitting match; son of the mill, will you take my daughter to wife?\" \"That I will, lord king!\" cried the miller's son, laughing louder than ever before. And so the miller's son and the beautiful princess were wed with great rejoicing, and lived happily in the kingdom where the sky now stayed firmly in its place."
