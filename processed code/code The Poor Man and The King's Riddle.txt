  "The Complete Story": {
    "Title": "The Poor Man and The King's Riddle",
    "Chapters": [
      "There was once a poor man who suffered great hunger. He had naught in the world but a single, dry seed. \"I shall eat it now and lessen my pains,\" thought the man. Then a little squirrel from a nearby tree called out, \"Hark ye, good man!\" \"If you plant that seed, in time you may have a whole tree of seeds.\" \"But my belly rumbles now!\" cried the man. \"Future feasts fill no empty stomach.\" Just then, a plump magpie landed on a branch and squawked, \"Pah! Seeds are for burying or forgetting!\" \"Give it to me, and I shall fetch you a gleaming pebble! Or we can toss it for sport!\" The squirrel chattered, \"Foolish bird! A pebble fills no belly, nor does sport grow into a meal!\" The poor man looked from the squirrel to the magpie, and his stomach growled louder still.",
      "\"I have it!\" said the man. \"I shall break the seed, eat half now, and plant the other half!\" The squirrel threw its paws to its head and cried, \"Alas, no! A broken seed grows naught!\" But before the man could act, the magpie swooped down, snatched one half of the imagined broken seed from the air, and chirped, \"A shiny half for my nest!\" The poor man blinked and then stood foolishly with empty hands. \"Next time,\" said the squirrel, twitching its nose, \"perhaps listen to one voice, or ensure you have a bigger seed to begin with.\" The poor man, having learned a lesson about breaking seeds and listening to too many advisors, decided then to seek his fortune in the world. He travelled for a day and a night and came to a wide river. An old ferryman with a long grey beard sat in his boat by the bank. \"Good ferryman,\" said the man, \"prithee, take me to the other side, though I have no coin.\" The ferryman stroked his beard and said, \"I will take you for a song you will sing me when you return this way next year, or you can mend that small hole in my net now for quicker passage.\"",
      "The man remembered his empty stomach and the squirrel's words, and thought, \"A mended net is better than a hungry year waiting for a song I might not remember,\" so he agreed to mend the net. He took the ferryman's needle and thread and deftly mended the small hole in the net, and soon the hole was gone. The ferryman nodded, pleased, and said, \"Well done, that will serve me well tonight,\" and he gave the man a bit of dried fish before rowing him across. The man ate the fish, and his spirits lifted, and he walked on until he came to a town with fine houses and bustling folk. There he saw a notice nailed to a post, declaring that the king offered his daughter's hand and half the kingdom to any man who could answer a riddle. The riddle was this: \"What is often eaten yet never diminishes, often planted yet never grows, and often given away yet always returns richer to the giver?\" Many proud knights and clever merchants had tried to answer, and all had lost their heads for their foolish guesses. The poor man thought, \"I have naught to lose but my hunger, which may be lost with my head anyway. Perhaps the answer lies not in riches but in choices.\" So he went to the castle gate and declared he would answer the king's riddle. The king looked at the poor fellow in dusty rags, chuckled, and said, \"Very well, let us hear your wisdom before you offer your neck to the axe, like all the others before you.\"",
      "The poor man stood tall and said clearly, \"The answer is Good Advice, or A Wise Choice.\" A hush fell over the court, and the king leaned forward from his throne, his brow furrowed in thought. \"Explain this answer, poor man, if it is not another path to the block,\" the king commanded. \"Good advice,\" said the man, \"can be heard and 'eaten' by the mind. Had I truly eaten the squirrel's advice about the whole seed, its value would not have diminished, though the seed was lost.\" \"A wise choice, once made, is 'planted' in one's history; it does not grow a stalk, yet its single instance can shape all that follows.\" \"And when good advice or the tale of a wise choice is 'given away' to another, it enriches the listener, and the giver feels a kingly satisfaction, returning richer in spirit.\" The king's eyes grew distant, and he spoke softly, \"Indeed, poor man, for I too was once a lad with naught but a single, foolish wish for a pie that was not yet baked.\" \"An old fox, much like your squirrel, advised me then, and like you with your seed, I was tempted by a chattering jay, much like your magpie, to waste my one chance on fleeting folly.\" \"But I heeded the fox, poor man; I chose to listen to one wise voice and invest my single chance, and that is how a goatherd's boy eventually became king of this land.\" \"You, poor man, have understood not only the words of my riddle but the hard journey to their truth. The princess and the half-kingdom are yours!\"",
      "There was great rejoicing in the court, and the poor man was dressed in fine silks, no longer a poor man but a prince by the king's decree. The princess, who was fair and wise herself, was pleased with his thoughtful eyes and the story of his journey. When he helped the old king rule, he often sought good counsel from many, but always weighed it carefully, remembering the squirrel and the magpie. As for the squirrel, it grew fat with many buried nuts each winter; and the magpie continued to chase fleeting gleams, its nest a jumble of useless, shiny things. The old ferryman on the river found his nets were always full, and he whistled merry tunes, no longer needing to trade passage for uncertain songs. The new prince and princess had many children, and they taught them early about the value of a whole seed planted wisely. The old king watched all this with a knowing smile, his riddle having found not just an answer, but an heir to its truth. For it is often said that a choice made in haste for a fleeting joy may leave a bitter taste, but a future sown with care and patience bears the sweetest fruit. And so they lived wisely and prospered, understanding the true measure of a good choice. And if they have not died, they are living there still."
