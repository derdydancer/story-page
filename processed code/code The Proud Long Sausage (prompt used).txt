Thank you, great work. Now I want you to write a new essay on the exact same format but as you go along you need to come up with a new original story. 
Let each chapter consist of 10 sentences. 
Write 5 chapters, so there will be 50 sentence sections in total. 
DO NOT COME UP WITH THE PLOT OR TITLE OR SETTING OR ANYTHING AT ALL BEFORE STARTING WRITING. 
You as the author need to come up with the plot "as you go" writing this. 
However, I want you to do one thing differently this time: 
For each section (sentence) start by writing the analysis/explanation/commenatary of the sentence and then write the sentence last after these,
(plot function, grimm style, moral implication, metaphorical/psychological meaning, sentence). 
So the header will just be "Sentence 1 (Authors explanation and commentary): ". This way you will "plan out" the sentence before writing it. 

You must also adhere to the following guidelines: 
- NEVER come up with names for characters, just call them "the king's son" or "The miller".
- NEVER come up with names for places (like Whispering Woods or anything like that). Just say "A dark forest".
- NEVER describe the inner state of characters (example to avoid: "her heart full of both fear and a strange resolve. " BAD!) Instead, write for example "Yet she did not step back nor tremble but carried on just as she had before." 

I also have some requirements for elements to be present in this particular story:
- comedy
- main character is sausage who is immensely proud of his length
- Is never bought but only admired
- Finally is bought and chopped up and suffers
- Cautionary tale

Do not write an intruduction. Start with 
"Chapter 1"
"Sentence 1 (Authors explanation and commentary):"

Finally, write out the whole story exactly as stated.
