  "The Complete Story": {
    "Title": "The Trembling Tailor and the Brave Trousers",
    "Chapters": [
      "There were once two kingdoms lying side-by-side, and between them there was little peace. Now, the king of the first kingdom had a daughter whose beauty was spoken of in all lands. The king of the second kingdom, who was known for his greed, sent messengers demanding the princess for his wife. But the princess's father, who loved his daughter, would not hear of it and sent back the messengers with empty hands. At this, the neighboring king grew mighty angry, gathered his soldiers, and marched towards the first kingdom to take the princess by force. In the city of the first kingdom dwelt a tailor's apprentice, who was known throughout the town for his shaking hands. When word came that the enemy king was marching, the apprentice's knees knocked together so loudly that the tailor thought mice were in the rafters. Now, it happened that the week before, a strange old man with eyes like shiny buttons had ordered a pair of sturdy trousers, but had never returned to collect them. The trousers were of plain brown wool, yet when the apprentice accidentally spilled his soup upon them while fetching them down, the cloth remained quite clean and dry, which was a marvel. So, seeing the strange man did not return and with war coming, the apprentice thought, \"Waste not,\" and put the trousers on himself, finding they fit tolerably well.",
      "The King ordered that all able-bodied men should take up arms and join the fight, and the tailor's apprentice was counted among them. He marched out with the others towards the border, and though his heart hammered like a drum against his ribs, the magic trousers kept his legs so steady that no one could see his fear, and they thought he walked straight and bold. When the battle began with great noise and the clashing of steel, many men fell on both sides, and the apprentice shut his eyes tight and wished himself back in the tailor's shop. He stumbled backwards in his fright, tripped over a root, and knocked over the enemy flag-bearer who stood just behind him. The great flag fell down, and three charging enemy soldiers tripped and tumbled over it, causing great confusion in their ranks. The apprentice scrambled up and grabbed the flag pole, thinking only it was something sturdy to grasp in the tumult. But his own side saw him holding the enemy flag aloft and thought he had captured it bravely, so they let out a great cheer. The enemy soldiers, seeing their flag taken and hearing the cheer, lost heart and began to fall back. The apprentice, not knowing what else to do when people started running, began to run too, mostly away from the loudest noise towards his own lines, but as he still held the flag, it looked as though he chased the enemy all by himself. Thus after his first battle, the tailor's apprentice was known throughout the army as the bravest man among them, though only the trousers knew the truth of his knocking knees.",
      "Some weeks passed, and the war dragged on, until the king needed to send a vital message to a besieged fortress, but the way was cut off by the enemy. The king asked his captains for a brave man to slip through the enemy lines and carry the message. But all the soldiers suddenly looked at their boots, or developed sudden coughs, or felt their old wounds twinging, and none stepped forward. The tailor's apprentice stood among them, feeling a cold sweat upon his brow, but his trousers kept him standing quite still, and his legs did not tremble in the least. The king saw him standing there, the only one not shuffling his feet, and said, \"Aha! Here is true steadfastness! You, tailor's apprentice, shall carry my message!\" The apprentice was given the sealed letter; his mouth opened and closed like a fish, but no sound came out, so the king clapped him on the back and sent him on his way. He set off at dusk, trembling inwardly where none could see, for every shadow seemed a foe, but the magic trousers kept his legs carrying him steadily forward through the woods. He came upon two enemy sentries huddled by a low fire, and in his fright he fumbled with the letter and dropped his waterskin with a clatter. The sentries leapt up, but the apprentice spun to flee, tripped again on his own feet, and fell headlong into the men, cracking their heads together with a sound like dropped melons; they lay quite still upon the ground. He reached the fortress before dawn, delivered the message, and the soldiers there spoke in whispers of his courage in passing the enemy lines and silencing the guards.",
      "The war took a grim turn when the enemy brought forth a champion, a great hairy man who roared like a bear and banged his shield, so that the hearts of the king's soldiers grew faint within them. This champion bellowed across the field, \"Send out your best man to fight me alone, and let us decide the day!\" But no man among the king's warriors stepped forward; indeed, many found their boots suddenly very interesting to look at. The tailor's apprentice stood among the ranks, his teeth chattering silently in his head, but outwardly the magic trousers held him firm as a fence post. The king, seeing him stand so still when all others trembled, cried out, \"Tailor's apprentice, you are the only one with courage left! Go you forth and fight this beast!\" Before he could protest, the apprentice was pushed forward onto the field, armed only with the long shears from his belt, though his legs, thanks to the trousers, carried him forward without a wobble. The great hairy champion laughed loud and long when he saw him, roaring, \"Does your king send a boy with sewing tools to fight me?\" The apprentice, knowing he was doomed, squeezed his eyes shut tight and ran forward blindly, holding his shears before him, hoping only for a swift end. Now the champion, stepping forward to swat him like a fly, slipped on a loose stone, and the blindly charging apprentice ran right into him, the points of the open shears piercing the champion's thick neck, so that he gave a great gurgle and fell down stone dead. There was a great silence upon the field, then the king's army let out a mighty shout, and the enemy, seeing their champion fall to a tailor's boy with shears, turned and fled in terror; thus the apprentice was hailed as the greatest hero of the war.",
      "The defeated king sued for peace on the very next day, and the victorious king returned to his castle with much rejoicing. The king called the tailor's apprentice before all the court and declared, \"This brave youth saved the kingdom, and he must be rewarded!\" \"I give you,\" said the king, \"a great chest of gold, and the title of Lord Needlepoint.\" The apprentice bowed low, not knowing what else to do, and took the chest of gold, trying not to blush at the title of Lord Needlepoint. But soon there was another trouble in the land, for a fierce wild boar was troubling the royal forest, and the king asked who would face it. All eyes in the court turned to the tailor's apprentice, the 'bravest man' and now Lord Needlepoint. The apprentice, knowing he could not refuse lest his cowardice be revealed, bowed again and said he would go into the forest on the morrow. He found the boar by a muddy pool, and when it charged with tusks gleaming, he dodged behind a great oak tree, and the boar charged headfirst into the wood and stuck fast by its tusks. The apprentice then took a sturdy rope, tied the boar's legs while it squealed and struggled, and dragged it back to the castle. The king was greatly pleased and gave the apprentice more lands and made him captain of the royal guard, a post which made his knees shake even more, though none could see it.",
      "Then word came that the king's jeweled Scepter, symbol of his rule, had vanished from the treasury, and the thief had gone unseen. The king summoned Lord Needlepoint, captain of his guard, and said that he trusted his skill and luck to find the Scepter. The apprentice felt his blood run cold, for he knew he had no skill in finding lost things, but he bowed and promised to search high and low, all the while wondering what he should do. He wandered about the castle for a day, peering under tables and behind curtains, not knowing where to look or what to ask. Quite weary, he leaned against a wall in the courtyard, and a stone came loose under his hand, revealing a dark hole wherein lay the Scepter, hidden among glittering pebbles and bits of glass gathered by a thieving magpie. The apprentice reached into the hole, shooed the angry magpie away, and drew out the jeweled Scepter. He brought it straight to the king, who marveled at his swift success and cleverness in finding what all the guards could not. The king declared that such wisdom deserved great honour, and he made the apprentice his chief counsel and gave him the richest province in the kingdom to govern. Now the princess, for whose sake the war was fought, had watched all this, and thought the tailor's apprentice, now a great lord, the finest man in the kingdom. The king, seeing how his daughter looked upon the hero, thought there was no reward better than this, and declared that the brave Lord Needlepoint should have the princess's hand in marriage.",
      "When the tailor's apprentice heard this, he turned pale as milk and swayed upon his feet, for he thought himself the greatest coward in the world to marry such a prize. He stammered something about being unworthy, but the court thought it modesty, and the king declared him overcome with joy. And so the wedding was held with great feasting, and the apprentice wore his magic trousers under his fine silken clothes, lest his legs give way before the altar. But that night, when he took off his wedding finery, the magic trousers came off too, and the princess saw his legs trembling beneath him like leaves in a wind. The princess looked at his trembling legs, and then at his face, and she did not frown but instead laughed softly. \"Truly,\" she said, \"a man who does brave deeds with such fear in his heart is perhaps the bravest of all.\" Hearing this, the apprentice felt a great warmth spread through him, and for the first time since the war began, his legs entirely stopped shaking, even without the trousers. They lived together very contentedly, and he ruled his province well, and the magic trousers were folded neatly and put away in a chest. His story was told throughout the land, especially the part about his shaky legs and the trousers. And that is why we always say, when someone looks bolder than they feel, \"His courage must be in his trousers!\""
