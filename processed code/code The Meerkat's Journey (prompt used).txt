Thank you, great work. Now I want you to write a new essay on the exact same format but as you go along you need to come up with a new original story. 
Let each chapter consist of 10 sentences. 
Write 12 chapters, so there will be 120 sentence sections in total. 
DO NOT COME UP WITH THE PLOT OR TITLE OR SETTING OR ANYTHING AT ALL BEFORE STARTING WRITING. 
You as the author need to come up with the plot "as you go" writing this. 
However, I want you to do one thing differently this time: 
For each section (sentence) start by writing the analysis/explanation/commenatary of the sentence and then write the sentence last after these,
(plot function, grimm style, moral implication, metaphorical/psychological meaning, sentence). 
So the header will just be "Sentence 1 (Authors explanation and commentary): ". This way you will "plan out" the sentence before writing it. 

You must also adhere to the following guidelines: 
- Do not come up with names for characters, just call them "the king's son" or "The miller".
- Do not come up with names for places (like Whispering Woods or anything like that). Just say "A dark forest".
- Do not describe the inner state of characters (example to avoid: "her heart full of both fear and a strange resolve. "). 

I also have some requirements for elements to be present in this particular story:
- epic tale of bravery
- Main character is a meercat
- A young companion from a peaceful homeland joins a small fellowship tasked with carrying a powerful artifact toward a distant stronghold.
- He leaves his home alongside a childhood friend to guard the artifact’s bearer. At a great council, he volunteers for the perilous journey, despite lacking combat experience.
- During travel through perilous lands, the fellowship is beset by relentless foes. Though he survives the battle that shatters the group, he is separated along with his friend.
- Wandering alone, they encounter warriors of a legendary realm who initially mistake them for enemies. Soon after, they are captured by servants of the dark power and taken to a forbidding stronghold, where one is chosen for a sinister purpose.
- Their friend returns in disguise, leading a rescue. In gratitude, they pledge themselves to his secret cause and aid him in a daring raid against the dark lord’s fortress. Their courageous act helps restore a long-lost monarch to power.
- Riding at the head of an allied host, they race against time to save an imperiled city. In the climactic clash, they play a key role in saving the restored king from certain death, turning the tide against the dark armies.
- With the artifact’s quest complete and the dark power defeated, he sails to a mystical land of healing. There he is honored by the restored rulers. Finally, he returns to his homeland, where he helps defend against a final incursion, then settles back into ordinary life—changed forever by his courage and adventures.

Do not write an intruduction. Start with 
"Chapter 1"
"Sentence 1 (Authors explanation and commentary):"

Finally, write out the whole story exactly as stated.
