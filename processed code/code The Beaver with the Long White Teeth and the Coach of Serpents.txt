  "The Complete Story": {
    "Title": "The Beaver with the Long White Teeth and the Coach of Serpents",
    "Chapters": [
      "There was once a Beaver who had the longest, whitest teeth in all the land. With these teeth, he built the most cleverly constructed and strong dams across the wide river. Now, it happened that the King of that land had a royal pond which, alas, had sprung a great leak. All the King's men tried to mend it with mud and stone, but the water flowed out still. Then a wise old advisor to the King said, \"Hark ye, your Majesty, there is a Beaver in the western marshes renowned for his dams; perhaps he can aid us.\" The King, who was at his wit's end, declared, \"Fetch me this Beaver then, and quickly!\" So, two royal footmen journeyed to the river and found the Beaver gnawing on a particularly stout log for his newest dam. \"Good Beaver,\" said one, \"you are summoned by royal command!\" The Beaver stopped his gnawing, his long white teeth glinting, and replied, \"Prithee, for what reason? This log requires my full attention.\" \"The King's royal pond has a grievous leak,\" answered the other footman, \"and it is said your great skill in dam-craft may seal it.\" The Beaver, seeing the importance, sighed a little puff of sawdust, gathered his few belongings, and betook himself with the footmen towards the King's palace.",
      "At length, they reached the King's palace, a grand place of stone walls so high the Beaver had never seen the like. The footmen led the Beaver through many echoing halls to the great throne room where the King sat upon a golden chair. \"So, you are the Beaver of whom they speak,\" said the King, looking down. \"Is it true you can build mighty dams?\" The Beaver nodded, and with a slight click, showed his long, white teeth. \"Indeed, your Majesty, my dams hold back the strongest currents.\" \"Very well,\" the King proclaimed. \"My royal carp pond loses water most grievously. By royal decree, you shall mend it forthwith!\" The Beaver was led to the edge of a wide, green pond, where water truly did gush from a hole near the bank, and he surveyed it with a critical eye. \"I shall require good stout branches, many pliable saplings, and a quantity of well-packed mud,\" the Beaver announced after a time. The King's gardeners and woodsmen, though they scratched their heads at this, soon brought all that he asked. Then the Beaver set to work with a will, and soon the air was filled with the sound of his long, white teeth shearing through wood like a sharp axe. Before the sun had set, lo and behold, the Beaver had fashioned such a cunning patch that the gushing stopped, and the royal pond was still and full once more.",
      "The King was greatly pleased and clapped his hands. \"Wonderful Beaver!\" he cried. \"You have saved my royal carp! Name your reward!\" The Beaver thought for a moment, then said, \"Your Majesty, a never-ending supply of good birch bark would be most welcome, and perhaps the services of a royal tooth-polisher, for these do get dull.\" The King chuckled at this and readily agreed, promising the Beaver the finest bark and a dedicated groom for his remarkable teeth. So the Beaver dwelt contentedly at the edge of the royal pond for some time, enjoying fresh bark daily and having his teeth polished to a magnificent gleam. One day, however, a pale and nervous-looking Secretary from a neighboring town arrived at the palace in great haste, seeking an audience with the King. \"Your Majesty,\" the Secretary stammered, bowing low, \"I am a truth-teller against a notorious band of robbers, and my life is in peril!\" \"I must journey to the High Court in the Northern City to speak what I have seen,\" he continued, \"and I beg a royal escort upon the great public coach that departs on the morrow.\" The King, being a just man, agreed at once. \"You shall have it! My most sturdy Captain of his Guard will see you safe to the Northern City!\" The Beaver, who was nearby polishing his teeth on a fine velvet cloth provided by the King, heard all of this with interest. On the morrow, the great public coach stood ready in the palace courtyard, the Captain armed and stalwart, and the Secretary still pale but determined.",
      "The Beaver, with a sudden twitch of his whiskers, decided this journey sounded far more interesting than pond maintenance and, unseen, scuttled aboard the coach, hiding amongst some luggage. With a crack of the whip and a lurch, the great coach rumbled out of the city gates, carrying the Captain, the Secretary, and, secretly, the Beaver. Meanwhile, the wicked robbers, having learned of the Secretary's journey and his escort, secretly plotted to silence him forever. Under the dark of night, before the coach had departed, two of their number had crept into the coach yard and loaded an unmarked crate filled with furious, venomous snakes into the rear baggage compartment. Within the crate, they had also placed a small, clay jar containing a wicked powder which, when released by a jolt they anticipated on the mountain pass, would enrage the serpents. The coach travelled for many leagues through forests and fields without event, the Captain vigilant, the Secretary slowly calming, and the Beaver dozing among the bags. As they began to climb a winding mountain pass, the coach wheels struck a great stone, and with a sharp crack, the clay jar in the baggage compartment broke, releasing the wicked powder. A furious hissing arose from the rear, for the powder greatly angered the venomous snakes, and they began to push and writhe against the lid of their crate. Soon, strange scratching and slithering sounds were heard by the passengers, and even the Beaver, now awake, pricked up his ears from within a large hatbox. \"What is that troubling sound, driver?\" called the Captain, but the portly driver merely shrugged. \"Likely some poorly tied baggage, sir, pay it no mind!\"",
      "But soon after, the first ugly, triangular head of a serpent pushed its way through a gap in the floorboards, its gleaming eyes fixing upon a sleeping merchant's boots. The serpent struck like lightning and bit him sharply on the ankle; the merchant cried out once and then fell still, and a great cry of terror arose from the other passengers. Then more snakes, and yet more, poured into the coach through every crack and crevice, striking at legs and arms, and soon chaos reigned as passengers shrieked and scrambled over one another. The Captain of the Guard drew his sword and fought bravely, hewing at the serpents and trying to shield the trembling Secretary. But alas, a particularly large viper, green as jade, darted past his guard and sank its fangs deep into his sword-wrist, and he too slumped down, his weapon clattering. The coach driver and his young assistant, hearing the screams from within, looked back in terror, and at that moment two snakes that had crawled outside slithered into their cabin and bit them both, causing the great coach to begin wildly careering down the mountain path. From his hatbox, the Beaver saw all this with growing alarm; when the coach began to sway and plunge, he knew enough was enough, and he darted out. With a speed that belied his round form, the Beaver, his long white teeth bared, began to snap at the nearest snakes, his bites as swift as thought, and several scaly heads were quickly severed. Seeing this, a stout woman with a carpet-beater and a thin scholar with a heavy book took heart and also began to thrash at the serpents. \"The snakes are dreadful,\" shrieked the Secretary, dodging a lunge, \"but alas, no one is guiding the horses, and we are heading for the cliff's edge!\"",
      "The Beaver, hearing this new alarm above the fray, left a half-chewed serpent and scrambled with great urgency towards the driver's seat. He found the portly driver and his assistant slumped over, their faces a ghastly green, and the reins were indeed dangling uselessly as the horses ran wild. The Beaver, with a mighty grunt, seized the thick leather reins in his long, white teeth and pulled with all his considerable strength. Clumsily but surely, he managed to tug the horses' heads slightly to the left, guiding the careering coach away from the sheer drop. Inside the coach, the stout woman and the scholar, joined now by a nervous young tailor, were still heroically swatting and stomping upon the remaining serpents. The Beaver, teeth aching from the strain of the reins, knew he could not hold this course for long and scanned the terrain below, spying a wide, flat meadow beside a gentle stream. He began to chatter loudly in beaver-speech, pointing with his nose towards the meadow, hoping someone inside would understand his intent. The thin scholar, who had once studied the languages of beasts for a treatise, peered out and exclaimed, \"By my books! I believe the brave rodent indicates a safe landing place yonder!\" Hope flickered amongst the terrified passengers; they now had a destination, but the horses were still running with considerable, uncontrolled speed towards it. Just then, with a terrible tearing sound, one of the main leather reins, already weakened by water from the pond adventure and now stressed by the Beaver's mighty jaw, snapped in two!",
      "With no hesitation, the Beaver spat out the useless end and, seeing a stout wooden luggage rail nearby, began to gnaw furiously at one end, intending to make a sort of crude steering pole. Inside, the tailor, proving surprisingly adept with his shears, snipped the last serpent in half, while the stout woman used her carpet-beater to knock another stunned snake out of a window. The Secretary, having fainted from all the excitement but now revived by the tailor, cried, \"The meadow approaches, but how shall we slow these maddened beasts?\" The Beaver, now with a sturdy, tooth-marked pole, jammed it somehow against the side of one of the lead horses, trying to push its direction, but it was an awkward business with limited effect. Then, an old man who had hitherto been quiet, a retired Coachman by his look, cleared his throat and said, \"Give me that pole, Master Beaver, and let an old hand try what he knows.\" The Beaver, with a grateful flick of his tail, passed the gnawed pole to the old man, who clambered carefully to the driver's box. The retired Coachman, with surprising strength and cunning, used the pole to press and tap upon the horses' flanks and rumps in a manner only a seasoned driver would know, and slowly, the wild gallop began to lessen. He guided them expertly now, and the great coach, though still moving swiftly, turned towards the gentle slope of the wide green meadow. With a final series of jolts and skids, the great coach shuddered to a halt in the middle of the soft meadow, its wheels intact, its frame battered but whole, and the passengers within let out a collective sigh of relief. They all clambered out onto the sweet grass, the Secretary, the stout woman, the scholar, the tailor, the old Coachman, and lastly the Beaver, whose teeth now felt quite blunt.",
      "\"Good sirs, and madam, and brave Beaver,\" said the Secretary, his voice still trembling, \"you have saved my life, and perhaps the cause of justice too!\" The old Coachman, however, was not listening; he was staring at something near one of the rear wheels of the coach – a small, dark, intricately carved wooden bird, no bigger than his thumb. When the Secretary, following the Coachman's gaze, saw the little wooden bird, he let out a shriek far louder than any he had made for the snakes, and his face became the color of ash. \"That token!\" he gasped, stumbling backwards, for the little wooden bird's carved eyes had suddenly blinked open, and they seemed to stare directly at him. The Beaver, too, seemed transfixed by the tiny bird, and his long, white teeth began to chatter softly, a sound like dry twigs rubbing together. The Captain, clutching his wounded wrist, frowned. \"Explain yourself, Master Secretary! Why does a mere child's toy fill you with such dread when live vipers did not undo you completely?\" \"That is no toy!\" cried the Secretary, wringing his hands. \"It is a Truth-Speaker's Doom, a cursed token of the Shadow Guild of Robbers I once served! If it sings my name, my old oath will claim my soul for my betrayal of them!\" As he spoke, the tiny wooden bird tilted its head, and its small, carved beak began to open wide, as if to utter a name or a terrible song. But before a sound could emerge, the Beaver, with a flick of his powerful neck, darted forward and snatched the wooden bird between his long, white teeth, crushing it instantly to a thousand tiny splinters. The Secretary stared, mouth agape, at the pile of wooden dust, then at the Beaver, who calmly licked a splinter from his lip, his white teeth immaculate once more.",
      "\"Well, Master Beaver,\" the Captain said, shaking his head slowly, \"that was quick work with that cursed thing, but we are still many leagues from any town, with a damaged coach and a witness who is also, it seems, a former rogue.\" The old Coachman inspected the wheels and axles. \"Aye,\" he sighed, \"she's taken a beating. One axle is cracked, and two wheels are splintered beyond roadside mending. We'll go no further in this.\" The Secretary, looking rather ashamed, spoke up. \"My past is dark, it is true, but my testimony against the Guild is honest. I still wish to deliver it, if there be any way.\" The Beaver, who had been quietly surveying the broken coach and then the tall, straight trees bordering the meadow, suddenly gave a decisive flick of his flat tail, and his teeth chattered with a new, energetic rhythm. He then began a series of frantic gestures towards the trees and the gentle stream at the meadow's edge, chittering rapidly until the Scholar's eyes widened. \"Astounding! I believe he means to fashion us a raft from those poplars to follow the stream north!\" \"A raft made by a beaver?\" the Captain mused, then slapped his thigh. \"By thunder, it's mad, but it's our best hope! Stout woman, tailor, lend the creature your aid! We must make haste!\" And so, a strange industry began: the Beaver, with mighty crunches, felled three slender trees in quick succession, while the humans, guided by his nudges and the Scholar's interpretations, trimmed branches and hauled the logs to the stream. By the time the first stars appeared, a sturdy, if somewhat oddly-shaped, raft lay tethered at the water's edge, built mainly of beaver-gnawed logs and stout vines dragged from the wreckage of the coach. They loaded what little food and water they could salvage, helped the still-weak Secretary aboard, and the Beaver, with a satisfied air, took his place at the rear with a long branch he had sharpened into a rudder-pole. With a push from the Captain and the old Coachman, the raft slipped into the cool water of the stream and began to glide quietly northwards under the moon.",
      "For three days and three nights they floated, the Beaver steering with his pole, occasionally gnawing a log end to better balance their vessel, while the others kept watch or rested. At dawn on the fourth day, the Scholar, who had been diligently charting their course by the stars, announced that the tall spires of the Northern City were visible in the distance, the stream apparently leading right to its lower gates. Their arrival by raft at the city's water-gate, a tired Captain, a stout woman, a scholar, a tailor, a trembling Secretary, and a very smug-looking Beaver with remarkably polished teeth, caused no small measure of astonishment to the city watch. The Captain, however, soon made their urgent business known, and after much official humming and hawing from a portly Magistrate, they were granted escort to the High Court itself. Before the stern-faced judges of the High Court, the Secretary, with the Beaver sitting unexpectedly at his feet like a furry footstool, told his whole tale, holding nothing back of the robbers' deeds nor his own former involvement. His words, and perhaps the peculiar sight of his beaver companion, carried such weight that warrants were issued, and by week's end, the entire Shadow Guild of Robbers was captured and brought to swift justice. The Secretary, for his perilous honesty, was given a full pardon and a quiet cottage by the sea, where he took up the writing of cautionary tales. News of the Beaver's exploits, the routing of the snakes, the steering of the coach, and the fashioning of the raft, eventually reached his own King, who swelled with such pride he nearly burst his best waistcoat. The High Court of the Northern City offered the Beaver a gilded cage and a pension of fresh fish, but he politely declined, stating his preference for dam-work, good bark, and the continued services of his original royal tooth-polisher. And so the Beaver returned to his own river, his fame widespread, his teeth ever gleaming, and he built the greatest dams seen in any age, though sometimes he would travel if a King had a particularly puzzling leak or required a very specialized bit of gnawing."
