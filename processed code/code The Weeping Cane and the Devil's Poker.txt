  "The Complete Story": {
    "Title": "The Weeping Cane and the Devil's Poker",
    "Chapters": [
      "Chapter 1\nThere was once a walking cane that dwelt in the corner of an old man's hut, and it often wept, for it knew it was made of wood and could never enter heaven. The old man, who was a woodcutter, would hear its little sobs and say, \"Alas, good stick, what troubles thee so?\" \"Oh, Master,\" the cane would reply, its voice like dry leaves rustling, \"I am naught but wood, and heaven is not for such as I.\" The woodcutter would pat its smooth head and say, \"But you are a sturdy cane, a fine piece of ash; many a man would be glad of your support.\" \"To be a sturdy support is a small thing, Master,\" sighed the cane, \"if only I could be but a splinter in an angel's wing!\" One day, a tall, cloaked stranger knocked upon the woodcutter's door when the wind howled like a hungry wolf. \"Good woodcutter,\" said the stranger, his voice like stones grinding, \"your hut is made of old wood, and I have need of such.\" \"It is poor wood, good sir, and little enough to keep out the cold,\" answered the woodcutter, bowing his head. \"The hut is of no matter then,\" the stranger declared, his eyes glinting in the dim light, \"but that is a peculiar stick in your corner.\" \"It weeps for heaven, you say?\" the stranger mused, a thin smile touching his lips, \"Then it is precisely what I need; I will have it.\"",
      "Chapter 2\n\"But good sir, it is only an old stick, and my sole companion these many years!\" cried the woodcutter, his hands trembling slightly. \"Your companionship will end with the morning light if I do not get it,\" the stranger replied, his voice dropping to a rasp, \"and your hearth will be cold indeed.\" \"Master, let him take me,\" whispered the cane, its voice barely a sigh, \"for what is my sorrow compared to your life? Do not grieve for me.\" So, with tears in his eyes which he quickly wiped away, the woodcutter picked up the cane and handed it to the tall stranger. \"It will weep no more for heaven, I assure you,\" the stranger chuckled, a sound like ice cracking, \"for it shall soon dance to a very different tune.\" Then the stranger, clutching the weeping cane, turned and vanished into the howling storm as if he were part of it himself. The stranger carried the cane swiftly through a dark forest, where the trees had grasping branches and the shadows seemed to whisper. \"Sir,\" trembled the cane, for it felt a great coldness from its new master, \"whither do you take me, so far from any hope of heaven?\" \"To a place where your wood will be most useful, little stick,\" the stranger sneered, \"and where heaven is but a forgotten dream.\" At last, they reached a barren mountain that reeked of sulfur, and upon its peak flickered many dark fires, around which dim shapes capered.",
      "Chapter 3\nThe dim shapes shrieked in greeting as the stranger approached, bowing low before him, their forms like twisted smoke. \"Behold, my lackeys!\" crowed the stranger, holding the cane aloft, \"I have brought us a fine new poker for the fires of sin, and this one weeps!\" The smoky figures howled with wicked laughter, and some clashed their fiery tongs together in anticipation, eager for a weeping poker. And so, the Devil thrust the weeping cane into the hottest flames that burned beneath a great cauldron, where souls were said to simmer. \"Alas, alas!\" hissed the cane as its tip sizzled and smoked, \"To be burnt in these unholy fires is a fate worse than being mere wood!\" A small, grey soul, tasked with stoking the embers beneath the cauldron, looked up from its miserable work and saw the cane. \"Why do you weep so, stick?\" asked the grey soul, its voice like ash. \"Are not all things in this place destined for burning?\" \"I weep not for the burning alone,\" replied the cane, smoke curling from its length, \"but because I am wood, and can never see the golden light of heaven.\" \"Heaven?\" the grey soul rasped, poking a lost hope with a charred finger. \"No wood here dreams of heaven; only of an end to the flames.\" Just then, the Devil returned, snatched up the sizzling cane, and with a hearty laugh, used it to cruelly stir the souls in the great cauldron, making them shriek anew.",
      "Chapter 4\nAs the Devil prodded a particularly plump bishop with the cane's burning tip, a single, pure white feather suddenly sprouted from the cane's other end. The Devil himself stepped back in amazement, and his smoky lackeys ceased their capering, for such a thing had never been seen in that grim place. Then another feather unfurled, and another, soft and white as fallen snow, until the top of the cane resembled a small, pristine wing. \"What is this lightness?\" whispered the cane, its voice no longer hissing but soft. \"Am I, poor wood, now sprouting angel's down?\" The Devil, enraged, snatched at the feathers with his clawed hand, but he howled and drew back as his wicked fingers smoked where they touched them. The little grey soul stared with wide, empty eyes, and a sound like a dry sob escaped it, murmuring, \"A light! A true light!\" Then a voice like thunder, yet gentle as a harp, filled the whole of Hell, saying, \"Nay, little one, thou art no common wood, but a feather lost from an Archangel's pinion, given to a faithful tender to guard.\" At this voice, the Devil shrieked and clutched his ears, his own dark fires dimming, and his grand horns seemed to droop most comically. The cane, or rather the angel's feather, now burst into a radiant wing of pure white light, that pulsed with warmth and a soft, celestial song. And this shining wing, free of all earthly sorrow, began to rise slowly from the sulfurous floor, leaving the Devil and his minions gaping below.",
      "Chapter 5\nAs the wing ascended, its gentle light washed over the grey soul, which felt its ancient burns briefly eased, and it shed a single tear that sizzled on the hot stones. With a final roar of fury, the Devil leapt high, lashing out with a fiery whip of his own making, but the whip merely struck his own snout, making him howl and dance in pain with a scorched nose. The shining wing shed no tear for his plight, but broke through the oppressive roof of that dark place as if it were mere mist. Higher and higher it flew, until it felt a great warmth and heard music sweeter than any earthly melody, and saw a light that outshone a thousand suns. It came before great gates of pearl, which opened wide, and figures made of pure light, angels with wings of every hue, came forth to greet it. \"Welcome home, little feather of Michael's own pinion,\" said a voice like silver bells. \"Thy long sojourn in the dark is ended.\" And the radiant wing, once a weeping wooden cane, flew to the mighty Archangel Michael and nestled once more upon his celestial armor, complete and shimmering. And in the old woodcutter's hut, far below, a single white feather drifted down onto his empty hearth, and from that day, he never felt the cold again. But in Hell, the Devil was still nursing his scorched nose and complaining loudly to his lackeys that good pokers were terribly hard to find. And so the feather remains in Heaven, the woodcutter warm by his fire, and the Devil without a decent poker to this very day."
