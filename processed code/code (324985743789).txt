      "One evening, he took her hand and asked gently, \"My Queen, what truly troubles you? Prithee, lift the veil from your heart.\"",
      "She looked away from his earnest gaze and replied, \"It is only a deep weariness, my King, that a night's rest does not seem to cure.\"",
      "The King nodded slowly, though his heart felt no lighter for her words.",
      "In the royal court, too, lords and ladies began to notice the Queen's quiet demeanor and infrequent laughter.",
      "Her sons often brought her flowers from the garden or simply sat near her, watching her with solemn eyes.",
      "She would thank them with a gentle smile, but the sadness lingered in the lines around her mouth.",
      "So the unseen burden in the Queen's heart did not lessen but seemed to deepen its hold with each passing moon.",
      "When the next season arrived, and the Queen's pallor had not improved, the King summoned the wisest physicians in the land.",
      "They came to the palace and felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and asked her many questions about her humours.",
      "The Queen answered them quietly, but she spoke little of the shadow that truly weighed upon her.",
      "So the physicians consulted amongst themselves for many hours, but they could find no cause for her lingering sadness, nor any certain cure.",
      "They went to the King at last and said, \"Your Majesty, we find no bodily ill that our arts can touch; her malady seems to lie deeper.\"",
      "The King heard their words and dismissed them with a heavy sigh, his brow furrowed with greater worry than before.",
      "After the physicians departed, the Queen spoke even less, and often she would sit by the window, gazing out at the distant horizon.",
      "A quiet gloom began to settle over the sunlit halls of the palace, and music was played less often.",
      "The two Princes watched their mother with troubled hearts, for they loved her dearly but knew not the cause of her persistent sadness.",
      "So the Queen remained alone with her shadow, and the King felt a growing fear that no earthly remedy could reach her.",
      "One day, while the Queen sat listlessly in her chambers, an old serving woman approached her with a hesitant air.",
      "The old woman curtsied low and said, \"Your Majesty, forgive my boldness, but I have heard whispers of a powerful magic across the great sea, a magic that might lift such shadows from the heart.\"",
      "The Queen looked up, and for the first time in many months, a flicker of light entered her eyes.",
      "\"Tell me more of this magic,\" she commanded softly, her voice still weak but now holding a thread of urgency.",
      "The old woman spoke of a desolate shore where a black tower stood, and within it dwelt a solitary Sorcerer of great but hidden power.",
      "\"It is said this Sorcerer can mend hearts that are broken or lay spirits to rest that are troubled by unseen woes,\" the old woman continued.",
      "The Queen listened to every word, and then she fell silent for a long time, her gaze fixed on that distant hope.",
      "At last, she looked at the old woman and said, \"If such a chance exists, no matter how remote, I must seek this Sorcerer.\"",
      "The old serving woman bowed her head and whispered, \"May your journey bring you the peace you seek, Your Majesty.\"",
      "So, with a newfound resolve stirring in her weary heart, the Queen determined to speak to the King that very day about her desperate hope.",
      "Later that evening, the Queen sought out the King, and she found him in his study, reading by candlelight.",
      "The King looked up and saw that though she was still pale, there was an unwonted light in her eyes.",
      "\"My Queen,\" he said, setting aside his book, \"you have something you wish to tell me.\"",
      "The Queen came closer and said, \"My lord, you know the strange shadow that chills my spirit and steals my joy.\"",
      "\"Today I learned of a possible remedy, a difficult path perhaps, but one I feel I must take. Prithee, grant me leave to journey across the sea, to seek a cure that may set my spirit free.\"",
      "The King's heart was heavy to hear this, for he loved his Queen dearly and the thought of her departure pained him.",
      "He looked at her earnest face and asked, \"Across the sea? That is a long and perilous voyage. What is this cure you speak of?\"",
      "The Queen then told him of the old woman's tale, of the desolate shore, the black tower, and the Sorcerer who dwelt there, mending troubled spirits.",
      "\"I know it is far, my lord,\" she said, her voice trembling slightly, \"but this shadow consumes me day by day. If there is any chance, I must take it.\"",
      "The King looked at her for a long moment, his expression deeply troubled, and then he said he must consider such a grave matter.",
      "All that night, the King paced the floors of his chambers, and he did not sleep.",
      "He thought of his love for the Queen and her deep unhappiness, and then he thought of the dangers of the sea and unknown Sorcerers.",
      "He considered their two young sons and how they would fare without their mother's presence for a long time.",
      "The next morning, he watched the Queen as she moved through the palace, her eyes hollow save for that faint hope she now carried.",
      "He remembered the words of the royal physicians, how they could find no earthly cause for her ailment.",
      "Perhaps, he thought, this strange journey was indeed her only chance to find peace from the shadow that haunted her.",
      "And because he loved her greatly, the thought of her continued suffering was more than he could bear.",
      "He spoke then to his oldest and most trusted counsellor, who listened gravely and advised caution but acknowledged the Queen's visible pain.",
      "By the afternoon, after much troubled thought and seeing the Queen's unwavering, desperate hope, the King's mind was set.",
      "So, with a heavy heart but a clear resolve, he knew he must grant her wish for her sake, though it would bring him great sorrow.",
      "That same evening, the King sent word for the Queen to attend him in the grand council chamber.",
      "She came to him there, pale but composed, her eyes questioning and filled with a fragile hope.",
      "The King looked upon her gently and said, \"My Queen, I have considered your words and the great unhappiness that burdens you.\"",
      "\"Though it grieves me to part from you, and though my heart is filled with unease for such a journey, I grant your wish to seek this cure across the sea.\"",
      "A small gasp escaped the Queen, and tears welled in her eyes, tears of relief and profound gratitude.",
      "\"Oh, my lord, my King,\" she whispered, sinking into a curtsy, \"you have given me the greatest gift, the gift of hope.\"",
      "The King raised her gently and said, \"You shall have my finest ship, a loyal captain, and whatever companions you deem necessary for your comfort and safety.\"",
      "A spark of her old vitality seemed to return to the Queen then, and she spoke of needing only a few trusted attendants and a swift departure.",
      "Word soon spread through the palace that the Queen was to undertake a long sea voyage to seek a cure for her lingering illness.",
      "So preparations began at once, yet a heavy air of anticipation and unspoken sorrow settled upon the royal household.",
      "The sun rose on a grey morning a few days later, the appointed time for the Queen's ship to sail.",
      "The Queen emerged from her chambers dressed in plain travelling clothes, her face pale but resolute.",
      "Her two sons stood waiting for her, their young faces etched with worry, and she embraced each of them tightly.",
      "\"Be brave, my sons,\" she whispered, \"and pray for my journey, that I may return to you well and whole.\"",
      "Then she turned to the King, who stood watching with a heavy heart, and they looked at each other for a long moment without words.",
      "The King took her hand and said softly, \"Go with my blessing, Anna. May you find the peace you seek, and return swiftly to us.\"",
      "With a final nod, the Queen turned and walked towards the waiting ship, her attendants following somberly behind her.",
      "The King and his two sons stood upon the shore and watched as the ship's sails caught the wind and carried her away across the grey waters.",
      "They watched until the ship was but a speck on the horizon, and then they turned back towards the palace with troubled hearts.",
      "And so, Queen Anna departed from the kingdom, leaving behind her husband and sons, and a shadow of uncertainty fell upon the once bright land.",
      "The Queen's ship sailed upon the wide ocean for many days and nights, and the winds were often fickle.",
      "Sometimes great waves crashed over the deck, and sometimes dark storms obscured the sun and stars.",
      "The Queen mostly stayed in her small cabin or sat wrapped in a cloak on the deck, her gaze often fixed eastward.",
      "When her attendants spoke to her of the kingdom left behind, she would only say, \"I seek the lifting of this shadow; that is my sole thought now.\"",
      "At long last, after what seemed an age of grey sea and sky, the ship's lookout cried that land was sighted ahead, a bleak and barren coastline.",
      "As the ship drew nearer, they saw no signs of habitation, only dark rocks and, standing starkly against the pale sky, a single tall and black tower.",
      "The Queen looked towards the tower with an unwavering gaze and then ordered a small boat to be lowered.",
      "Her loyal captain offered to accompany her, but she shook her head and said, \"This is a path I must walk alone.\"",
      "So she was rowed to the desolate shore, and she stepped out onto the black, volcanic sand, the only sound the waves and the distant cry of a lone seabird.",
      "Then the Queen turned and walked steadily across the barren land towards the dark, silent tower that held her only hope for peace.",
      "The black tower had no windows visible from the ground, only a single, large door made of heavy, dark wood.",
      "The Queen paused before it for a moment, then raised her hand to knock, but before her knuckles touched the wood, the door swung inward silently.",
      "She stepped inside into a vast, dimly lit circular hall, where the air was cold and still, and in the center sat a tall figure upon a single, unadorned chair.",
      "The figure was a Sorcerer, cloaked in long dark robes, his face shadowed by a deep hood, but his eyes were visible, and they were cold and keen.",
      "The Sorcerer did not rise but watched her approach, and then he spoke, his voice low and resonant, \"I know why you have come, Queen from the sunlit lands.\"",
      "The Queen stopped a respectful distance away and replied, \"Great Sorcerer, I have journeyed far to seek your aid, to overcome the shadow on my heart.\"",
      "The Sorcerer inclined his hooded head slightly and said, \"The shadow can be lifted, yes. But all magic has a price, Queen. That is the first law.\"",
      "The Queen, her voice tight with longing for relief, answered quickly, \"If you can end this torment, ask for anything. I will give my all if this crushing weight will fall from my soul!\"",
      "The Sorcerer replied, his voice devoid of emotion, \"I ask not for gold or gems, for those I have in abundance. But the next time you cherish a thing of beauty, save for your own kin, a sliver of its joy shall be my fee.\"",
      "\"Agree to this, Queen, and find your spirit's ease. Refuse, and return to your shadowed lands as you came.\"",
      "Queen Anna repeated his words thoughtfully, \"A sliver of its joy, you say, from things of beauty I cherish, but not my kin?\"",
      "The Sorcerer nodded once, his cold eyes fixed on her. \"That is my fee, clearly stated. A small share in your delight, nothing more.\"",
      "The Queen considered this for another moment and thought, \"My sons, my husband, they are my greatest treasures, and they are safe from this. What are gems or art compared to a lightened heart?\"",
      "Then she looked directly at the Sorcerer and declared, \"That seems a small price indeed for the peace I crave. I agree! Your terms I shall fulfill!\"",
      "A flicker that might have been satisfaction, or perhaps something else, crossed the Sorcerer's shadowed face for an instant, then he said, \"So be it. The bargain is struck.\"",
      "Then the Sorcerer lifted one long-fingered hand, and a faint, cold mist seemed to gather around it before he gestured towards the Queen.",
      "A perceptible chill touched the Queen's brow for a fleeting moment, and at once, she felt a great weight lift from her spirit, a wave of peace washing through her.",
      "The lines of sorrow around her mouth seemed to smooth away, and her eyes regained their former light and clarity.",
      "She drew a deep breath, the first truly easy breath in years, and then she turned with a lighter step to depart from the tower.",
      "But unseen by her as she left, a thin thread of shadow unspooled from her very being, tethering her back to the tower, and the Sorcerer watched her go and thought, \"The magic is spun. What joy she touches now, will be undone.\"",
      "The journey back across the wide ocean was swift and untroubled, with fair winds and calm seas guiding the Queen's ship homeward.",
      "She smiled often, and spoke with her attendants of the beauty of the sunsets over the water, and of her eagerness to see her family.",
      "Word had been sent ahead by a swift messenger bird that the Queen was returning, and that she seemed much improved in spirit.",
      "So the King and his two sons, along with the entire court, made preparations for her welcome, their hearts filled with a cautious hope.",
      "Then one bright morning, a cry went up from the watchtowers; the Queen's ship was sighted on the horizon, its sails full and white.",
      "When the Queen stepped ashore, she looked radiant indeed, no longer pale and burdened, but with a light in her eyes that gladdened all who saw her.",
      "King Peter rejoiced to see her vibrant self apparently restored, and he strode forward quickly to greet her with open arms.",
      "Her two sons ran to her side, their faces bright with happiness, and she embraced them warmly, her laughter echoing for the first time in many years.",
      "Just then, as the royal family was reunited on the quay, a courtier brought forth a magnificent new crown adorned with flawless gems, a gift to the Queen signifying unity and joy.",
      "\"Behold this treasure, my love,\" said the King, his voice warm with happiness, placing the glittering crown in Anna's hands.",
      "Queen Anna gazed upon the crown, truly loving its intricate beauty and the sparkle of its gems, and she cried, \"Oh, wondrous craftsmanship! It fills my soul with delight!\"",
      "At that very instant, as her words of delight were spoken, the crown's gems visibly dimmed, and their brilliant sparkle seemed to dull before their eyes.",
      "A look of fear dawned on Anna's face, and she whispered, \"The light... what has happened to the light?\"",
      "King Peter frowned with a flicker of unease, though most of the court, caught up in the joy of her return, noticed little of the subtle change.",
      "\"It is as if a breath of joy was stolen from it!\" the Queen murmured, looking from the dulled crown to the King's face.",
      "\"It is splendid, love,\" said the King, forcing a smile, though his unease remained. \"Perhaps just a trick of the light, or a passing cloud.\"",
      "The court then proceeded with the planned celebrations for the Queen's return, and there was music and feasting, but the Queen held the dulled crown with a troubled expression.",
      "Later, in her chambers, the Queen took out a beloved silver locket, a gift from her childhood, and gazed upon its delicate engraving with affection.",
      "As she felt a wave of fondness for the locket, its polished surface seemed to cloud over slightly, losing a fraction of its sheen.",
      "So from that day forward, a shadow began to creep over the kingdom, born from the Queen's secret bargain, and the vibrant hues of joy everywhere started to subtly fade.",
      "Many seasons passed, and the kingdom's bright colours continued to fade slowly, like a beautiful tapestry left too long in the sun.",
      "Queen Anna seldom touched or openly admired anything of beauty now, fearing to see its light diminish further, and she walked as if in a perpetual shade.",
      "The King grew older and more troubled, for he saw the Queen's distant manner and the pervasive dimness that had settled upon his once-bright land.",
      "One evening, he gently asked her, \"Anna, my love, the light we once knew seems so diminished in you, and in our halls. What new shadow is this?\"",
      "The Queen looked away, a flicker of her old fear in her eyes, and replied, \"It is nothing, my lord, perhaps just the passing of years that dims all things.\"",
      "But the King felt something was deeply wrong beyond the mere passage of time, and he knew in his heart this was not the whole truth.",
      "Meanwhile, as the gloom deepened, the elder Prince, now a young man, found some distraction in the company of a travelling Bard with twinkling eyes and a colourful, patched cloak.",
      "This Bard was a master of the lute and a singer of comical and wise songs, and he often spoke of the importance of mastering oneself before mastering any instrument.",
      "The elder Prince enjoyed the lively tunes the Bard played but often found his talk of inner harmony and self-awareness somewhat tedious.",
      "Then one night, as the King sat alone in his study, his mind heavy with the kingdom's sorrow, he remembered old tales of a forgotten Magic Mirror hidden somewhere in the castle attics that showed truths long past.",
      "A new resolve formed in the King, and he decided that on the morrow he would search the dusty attics for this forgotten mirror.",
      "That very night, as he lay in his bed, a small, grey bird flew in through his open window and perched on his bedpost.",
      "Then the bird sang in a clear, sweet voice a short rhyme: \"Seek the glass where shadows sleep, For hidden truth the echoes keep.\"",
      "Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the bird flew away as silently as it came, leaving the King much amazed and more determined than ever.",
      "The next day, the King, giving some excuse to his court, went alone to the dusty, cobweb-filled attics of the oldest part of the castle.",
      "He searched for many hours among old furniture, discarded tapestries, and chests filled with relics of generations past.",
      "At last, in a far corner, hidden behind a stack of disused shields, he found a tall, narrow object entirely covered in a heavy, dark velvet cloth.",
      "With a sense of strange anticipation, the King pulled the cloth away, and revealed not shining glass, but a surface as dark and unreflective as a midnight pool.",
      "He touched its cold frame and commanded, \"Mirror, if you are the glass of old tales, show me the cause of the sorrow we keep!\" but the dark surface remained unchanged.",
      "Disappointed, the King covered the strange glass again and left the attic, wondering if the tales were merely fables or if he lacked the true key to its power.",
      "That night again, as the King pondered the mirror's silence, the same small, grey bird flew in through his window and perched once more on his bedpost.",
      "It tilted its head and sang its sweet, clear song: \"Not command, but heart's true plea, Unlocks the sights for eyes to see.\"",
      "Then, with a flutter of its wings, the bird was gone, leaving the King to contemplate its new words.",
      "The King thought long on this, understanding that perhaps his first approach to the mirror had been too stern, too commanding.",
      "For the third night, as the King lay waiting with a mix of hope and doubt, the little grey bird returned as before.",
      "This time its song was brief and clear: \"Ask of the Queen, and her far shore, And what was priced at bargain's core.\"",
      "And with that, the bird flew out into the darkness and was seen no more by the King.",
      "A heavy certainty settled upon the King then, for the rhymes now seemed to form a clear instruction.",
      "He looked out his window at a rosebush in the moonlight, noticing how its perfect blooms grew alongside sharp thorns, and how both were part of its nature.",
      "So, the following dawn, with the bird's rhymes echoing in his mind and the image of the rosebush still fresh, the King went once more to the silent attics.",
      "He found the tall, narrow glass still hidden in the corner and, with a slow breath, pulled away the velvet cloth once more.",
      "This time, he did not command, but spoke quietly to the dark, still surface, \"Mirror, I ask not with command but with a heart heavy with sorrow. Show me what befell my Queen on her journey to the far shore; show me the bargain that was struck for her heart's ease.\"",
      "As he finished speaking, the dark surface of the mirror began to shimmer, and then pale mists swirled within its depths.",
      "Slowly, the mists parted, and an image formed, as clear and undeniable as if he were truly there: he saw the desolate shore and the black tower.",
      "Then he saw his Queen Anna, looking weary but resolute, stepping before the tall Sorcerer with the cold eyes.",
      "The King watched in horrified silence as the mirror showed their conversation, and he heard the Sorcerer's demand: \"the next time you cherish a thing of beauty, save for your own kin, a sliver of its joy shall be my fee.\"",
      "He saw Queen Anna's brief hesitation, then her quick, eager agreement, her voice clear in the vision, \"That seems a small price. I agree! Your terms I shall fulfill!\"",
      "Then the mirror showed the Sorcerer lifting his hand, the chill touching the Queen's brow, and the sudden wave of peace that smoothed her features as her eyes regained their former light.",
      "And then, a detail the Queen herself had not seen, the mirror showed the thin thread of shadow unspooling from her, tethering her back to the Sorcerer's tower.",
      "Finally, the vision shifted to the Queen's return, to her holding the gifted crown, and the King watched again in horror as its light visibly dimmed the moment she cherished its beauty and spoke her delight.",
      "The images in the mirror faded back into mist, and King Peter staggered back from the glass, his face pale as ash.",
      "He leaned against a dusty chest for support and whispered to the silent attic, \"Anna... my Queen... for your own ease... you betrayed the joy of the entire kingdom?\"",
      "A great weight of sorrow settled upon him then, a sorrow far deeper than before, for it felt as if all the trust and love he held had been shattered.",
      "A cold wave of anger passed through him, followed by a faint, painful understanding of the torment she must have endured to make such a choice.",
      "Yet, though filled with this new and terrible grief, a different kind of resolve began to form in him as he stood there in the dust and shadows.",
      "He looked at the dark mirror once more and decided, for the sake of the kingdom, and perhaps from a lingering, wounded pity for the Queen, this truth must remain hidden from all others.",
      "Then he carefully draped the heavy velvet cloth back over the unblinking eye of the mirror, shrouding its terrible knowledge once more.",
      "He would decree, he determined, that the Queen's old illness had merely taken a deeper, more troubling turn, affecting her mind.",
      "And for her own troubled state, and to prevent further accidental harm to the kingdom's fading joys through her unknowing touch, she must be confined to distant chambers.",
      "So, with a heavy heart and the weight of this secret pressing down on him, the King left the attics, a changed man.",
      "The next day, the King made a solemn decree to his court and to his sons, his voice heavy with feigned sorrow.",
      "He announced that the Queen's spirit, once so bright, had succumbed further to the shadows that had long plagued her, and that her mind was now deeply troubled and confused.",
      "\"For her own rest and quiet,\" the King declared, \"and to shield her from the demands that might worsen her fragile state, she must be moved to the peaceful, distant chambers in the west wing.\"",
      "A hush of sorrow fell upon the court, and the two Princes listened with pale faces and deep distress, for they loved their mother dearly.",
      "The Queen herself, when informed by the King in private of this decision, received the news with a strange quietness, her shadowed eyes revealing little.",
      "So it was done, and the Queen was gently escorted to comfortable but remote chambers in the quietest wing of the palace, with only a few trusted attendants to see to her needs.",
      "The great halls of the palace seemed emptier thereafter, and laughter became an even scarcer sound than before.",
      "The two Princes were allowed to visit their mother on certain days, but her manner was often distant, and their hearts ached for the warmth they remembered.",
      "The kingdom mourned what they believed was a beautiful Queen lost to a troubled mind, and prayers were offered for her recovery, though few now expected it.",
      "And the King ruled on, with a heavy heart but a composed facade, carrying the secret of the mirror's revelation alone.",
      "Years passed, and the shadow over the kingdom did not lift; indeed, the very colours of the world seemed muted, and joy was a rare visitor.",
      "Queen Anna, seldom seen by anyone but her attendants and occasionally her sons, grew frailer and more silent in her distant chambers.",
      "The thoughtful older Prince and the quiet younger Prince grew to young men in this time of gloom, their childhood memories of a sunlit kingdom fading.",
      "The elder Prince still sought out the old Bard from time to time, who now had a permanent, if humble, place at court, but the Prince still preferred the Bard's swift melodies to his slow lessons of the heart.",
      "During these long years, a vast Dark Forest of Thorns began to grow along one border of the kingdom, slowly encroaching and dividing the land.",
      "All who lived in the sundered land felt the weight of the shadow in some way; even the trees seemed to sigh, and true joy was scarce.",
      "King Peter continued to rule with a heavy heart, watching his sons grow, and seeing the light of his kingdom remain stubbornly dim.",
      "No one in the kingdom, save the King, truly understood the cause of this enduring sorrow, and perhaps some of the shadow's power lay in its hidden cause.",
      "Sometimes, in the deep of night, the King would look towards the Queen's silent wing of the palace and wonder if there had ever been another path, another way to face the shadow she had carried.",
      "And so the long, weary years unfolded one after another, and the sundered kingdom waited without knowing for what it waited."
