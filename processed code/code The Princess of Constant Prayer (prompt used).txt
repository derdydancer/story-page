Thank you, great work. Now I want you to write a new essay on the exact same format but as you go along you need to come up with a new original story. 
Let each chapter consist of 10 sentences. 
Write 7 chapters, so there will be 70 sentence sections in total. 
DO NOT COME UP WITH THE PLOT OR TITLE OR SETTING OR ANYTHING AT ALL BEFORE STARTING WRITING. 
You as the author need to come up with the plot "as you go" writing this. 
However, I want you to do one thing differently this time: 
For each section (sentence) start by writing the analysis/explanation/commenatary of the sentence and then write the sentence last after these,
(plot function, grimm style, moral implication, metaphorical/psychological meaning, sentence). 
So the header will just be "Sentence 1 (Authors explanation and commentary): ". This way you will "plan out" the sentence before writing it. 

You must also adhere to the following guidelines: 
- NEVER come up with names for characters, just call them "the king's son" or "The miller".
- NEVER come up with names for places (like Whispering Woods or anything like that). Just say "A dark forest".
- NEVER describe the inner state of characters (example to avoid: "her heart full of both fear and a strange resolve. " BAD!) Instead, write for example "Yet she did not step back nor tremble but carried on just as she had before." 

I also have some requirements for elements to be present in this particular story:
- comedy
- main character is princess who must go through many terrible ordeals
- Intruduce more characters as the story continues
- Use the cruelest fairy tale characters you can think of
- The princesses sole virtue is being chaste and always praying to God for guidance.
- DO NOT use any type of wise old woman figures.
- An unexpected but revealing plot twist, not revealed until chapter 6 (avoid deciding exactly what the secret will be until ch 6).
- The psychological metaphorical issues should be resolved towards the end in a suitable manner.

Do not write an intruduction. Start with 
"Chapter 1"
"Sentence 1 (Authors explanation and commentary):"

Finally, write out the whole story exactly as stated.
