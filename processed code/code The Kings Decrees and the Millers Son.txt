  "The Complete Story": {
    "Title": "The King's Decrees and the Miller's Son",
    "Chapters": [
      "There was once a king in a certain kingdom who was exceedingly fond of making laws. One day he decreed that no man, woman, or child in his kingdom should walk backwards, not even by a single step. This caused great trouble, especially for the baker who, when taking bread from his hot oven, found himself turning round and round like a spinning top. Now, there was a miller in a village nearby who had three sons, and the youngest was thought to be quite clever. The third son saw his father struggle greatly, for he could scarcely turn the heavy sacks of flour without taking a backward step. So the clever son fashioned a sort of harness with ropes and a pole, which allowed his father to turn the sacks without the man needing to step back at all. Word of this harness reached the king, who was greatly interested in anything to do with his laws. He sent for the miller's son at once, saying he wished to see this clever device himself. When the miller's son showed the king the harness and the pole, the king declared, \"Excellent, but from this day forth, no man shall use a pole longer than his own arm!\" Alas, the pole for the miller's harness was quite long, and so the clever device became useless overnight.",
      "The miller's son went home and thought for a day and a night about the king's new law. Meanwhile, the king, feeling pleased with his law-making, decreed that no creature with feathers should fly higher than the king's own hat when he stood upon his balcony. Naturally, the birds of the kingdom were in great confusion, flying low and bumping into chimneys and trees in their efforts to obey. The miller's son came out of his house and saw the poor birds flapping about in distress near the ground. As he watched them, he noticed something glinting in the grass; it was a small snare made of woven moonlight, and it was said by old folk that such a snare could trap that which seemed most unstoppable. An idea came to him; he took the snare and went quietly towards the palace, intending to catch the king's hat itself. Just as the king stood upon his balcony in the morning sun, the miller's son crept near the wall below and deftly cast the loop of moonlight upwards. The snare flew true and whipped the hat right off the king's head, sending it sailing away over the palace rooftops. Instantly, all the birds in the kingdom soared joyfully upwards, filling the air with their songs. The king was so astonished at seeing the birds fly high again without consequence that he forgot all about his hat being stolen.",
      "Some days later, feeling cheerful because the birds were behaving naturally again, the king remembered the miller's son and sent for him, giving him a purse heavy with gold for his earlier cleverness with the harness. But the king could not stop making laws, and soon he decreed that no one in the palace was allowed to sneeze, for he found the sound startling. This caused great discomfort in the palace, where courtiers pinched their noses tightly, their eyes watered constantly, and they walked about stiffly, afraid of the slightest tickle. Now, all this unnatural quietness and nose-pinching attracted the attention of the Devil himself, who came visiting the palace one afternoon disguised as a travelling merchant selling pepper. He walked through the halls, wafting spoonfuls of strong pepper from his bag, and soon the poor courtiers began to struggle mightily against powerful urges to sneeze. At last, one plump lord could bear it no longer and let out a sneeze like a thunderclap, right before the king. The king was furious at this noise and ordered the plump lord seized immediately and locked in the highest tower of the castle for three years. The miller's son saw all this from a corner, and noticed the disguised Devil still wafting his pepper with a grin. He knew what he must do; he quietly took out the moonlight snare again and aimed it carefully at the Devil's pepper bag. The loop shot out and snatched the bag cleanly from the Devil's hand, leaving him standing foolishly holding nothing but air while the scent of pepper faded away.",
      "The Devil, furious at losing his pepper bag, rounded on the miller's son and hissed, \"You meddling boy, give that back!\" \"Nay,\" said the miller's son calmly, \"the king forbids sneezing, and this pepper causes sneezing, therefore this bag is an illegal item in the palace.\" The Devil stamped his foot in rage, for he could not argue with the king's law within the palace itself, and so he vanished in a puff of brimstone. The king, who had seen the disguised merchant vanish angrily, was much impressed that the miller's son had somehow dealt with the troublesome fellow, and he gave him a fine horse with a saddle of silver. Now, the king had a daughter who was known throughout the land for being very beautiful. The king, still not content, next decreed that whoever wished to marry his beautiful daughter must first leap his horse clear over the palace roof from one courtyard to the other. Many proud princes and knights came to try, but their horses balked at the height, and they all failed, landing ignominiously in the royal laundry tubs or the cook's cabbage patch below. The miller's son, looking at the fine horse the king had given him, decided he too would try this leap. He rode into the first courtyard, and though his horse seemed good, the palace roof looked terribly high, and he remembered the moonlight snare tied to his saddle. He took the snare, and thinking not of trapping but of pulling, cast it high towards a sturdy chimney on the far side of the roof.",
      "The moonlight snare flew straight and true, catching fast about the stone chimney on the far courtyard roof. Then the miller's son spoke encouraging words to his horse, gave a great cry, and the horse gathered itself and sprang powerfully into the air. Up they sailed, horse and rider, as if drawn gently but firmly by the moonlight rope, and landed safely in the second courtyard on the other side. A great cry of amazement rose from the king, the princess, and all the court, for they had never seen such a leap. The miller's son quickly pulled his snare free from the chimney and tucked it back into his belt before anyone could look too closely. The king himself came down into the courtyard, slapped the miller's son on the back, and declared, \"A mighty deed! You shall have the honourable post of Chief Royal Rat-Catcher, with a bag of silver every week!\" But the king, ever fond of rules, added, \"However, before any marriage takes place, there is one last law: the suitor must remain utterly silent for a full hour while sitting beside a cage containing twelve angry geese from my neighbour's farm.\" Now these twelve geese were famous in the land for having the loudest hissing and the fiercest ankle-biting of any geese known, and no man had ever managed to sit silently beside them for five minutes, let alone an hour. The miller's son, seeing the princess watching him hopefully, agreed readily to this final trial. The cage full of angry geese was brought into the great hall, the miller's son sat down on a stool beside it, and at once the twelve geese began to hiss, flap, and screech with tremendous fury.",
      "The miller's son sat quite still and, to keep his mind from the noise, began steadily counting the hairs on his own arm. But the Devil, who was not beaten yet, crept silently back into the hall disguised this time as a tiny blue fly. He buzzed about the youth's face, landing persistently on his nose and tickling the inside of his ear most vexingly. The miller's son did not make a sound, but very slowly he reached for the moonlight snare at his belt and opened the loop just slightly in his hand. The next time the blue fly buzzed near his fingers, he deftly snapped the snare shut, trapping the Devil inside the loop of moonlight. The Devil buzzed furiously inside the snare but could make no sound, for the woven moonlight held him fast and silent. The hour passed, and the miller's son had not uttered a single word nor made a single angry gesture. The king stood up and declared loudly, \"He has passed the final test! This clever miller's son shall marry my daughter!\" Then the miller's son turned to the snare, opened it just slightly, and whispered to the trapped fly, \"Be gone from this kingdom, Devil, and do not return, or I will trap you in this snare forever.\" The tiny blue fly gave a tiny squeak of fear, shot out of the snare the moment it was fully open, and flew away from the palace as fast as it could, and was never seen in that kingdom again.",
      "So the miller's son married the beautiful princess, and a great feast was held that lasted for seven days and seven nights. The king grew quite fond of his clever son-in-law and listened more to his sensible advice, so that he made fewer troublesome laws than before. The plump lord who had sneezed was eventually let out of the tower, much thinner and vowing never to eat pepper again as long as he lived. The miller's son used the silver he earned as Chief Royal Rat-Catcher to help his father and brothers at the mill, so they prospered too. He and the princess were very happy together, for she admired his cleverness as much as he admired her beauty. As for the moonlight snare, the miller's son kept it safe in a carved wooden box. He kept it safe, just in case the king ever made a law against hiccups, or perhaps snoring. And so the kingdom became a slightly more sensible place to live, though still prone to the occasional odd law. The miller's son and the princess lived happily in the palace for many years. And if they have not died, they are living there still, and he likely rules wisely after the old king finally stopped making laws altogether."
