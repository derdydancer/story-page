        "Grimm Style": "King's positive reaction. Gives the third reward (Captain's position, command of guard). Follows reward structure. Hero ascends further.",
        "Moral Implication": "Continued rewards for loyalty, success, and bringing stability. Meritocracy through deeds.",
        "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The ruling Ego (King) further rewards the integrated Ego (apprentice) for resolving the second threat and confirming stability. The Ego gains command over the conscious control/defense functions (Guard Captaincy), replacing the corrupt element.",
        "Sentence": "The King was much pleased to be rid of the greedy Captain and the threat of more fish, and made the apprentice Captain of the Guard in his place."

        "Plot Function": "Introduces the third evil deed. The banished brother, having not received his expected 'proof' or reward, appears and uses the clock (which the apprentice must have returned by now, maybe off-screen, or perhaps the brother had a spare?) to cause mischief or attempt usurpation. Let's assume apprentice returned it. Brother uses it now.",
        "Grimm Style": "Introduces the third conflict/villain (banished brother). Motivation is revenge/ambition. Uses the magic item (clock) for evil. Creates the final challenge before the ultimate reward.",

This represents the danger of incompletely resolved Shadow issues resurfacing with disruptive power.",
        "Sentence": "But the banished brother, stewing under his arch and feeling cheated of his clock's true price, finally emerged and used the clock's power to turn back time whenever the King made a wise decision, causing chaos."

        "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The integrated Ego (apprentice) confronts the vengeful Shadow (brother). The Shadow attempts to use the time tool defensively, but the Ego, understanding its limitations (one-hour), uses superior foresight or timing (perhaps derived from mathematical prediction) to overcome the temporal manipulation. Conscious strategy defeats reactive misuse of psychic power.",

Hearing how it misused the psychic tool (clock) to disrupt order, it decrees a punishment that reflects the crime: being bound to the malfunctioning tool, forced to experience fragmented time. This neutralizes the threat and integrates the understanding of the misuse of this power.",

The integrated Ego achieves wholeness and takes its place as the successor. The etiological ending grounds the archetypal story in collective consciousness (a saying). The phrase should relate to the overwhelming numbers or the fishy situation. \"Something smells fishy\" is too obvious. Maybe related to the doubling, like things getting out of hand, \"gone exponential\"? Too modern. How about the chaos of the brother's punishment? \"All higgledy-piggledy\"? Connects to the disordered time.",
