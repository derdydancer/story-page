The Manless Kingdom
In a certain kingdom, a great war had raged for thirty long years, so that when peace came at last, there were no men left between the ages of fifteen and sixty, but only boys, old women, young women, girls, and the very old king. The very old king worried day and night, for his only child was a daughter, and his land had few defenders beyond palace guards too old to fight well and boys too young to shave. Now, the king’s daughter was beautiful, as princesses often are in such tales, and she was sought after by many, though none dwelt within their own borders who were fit to rule beside her. The king of a neighboring kingdom, whose own land was full of strong men, looked upon this situation and thought it ripe for his advantage, eyeing the princess and the weakened realm. In the village near the castle dwelt a miller, and the miller’s third son, a boy of fourteen years, spent his days like all the other boys, doing chores once handled by men. This boy was set the task of chopping firewood, though he was clumsy with the axe and more often hit his own shin than the log before him. Now, the old king kept in his private chamber a great mirror with a frame of dark wood, which had the power to let a person speak with the spirits of his ancestors, if he but knew how to ask. The king went often to this mirror, and gazed into it, and asked his grandfather, and his grandfather’s father before him, how he might protect his daughter and his land from the greedy neighboring king. His grandfather’s father, who had been a famously grumpy man in life, appeared in the glass and grumbled, "Bah! Stop bothering me! If you have no men, teach the geese to carry swords!" So the king, sighing heavily, issued a decree throughout the land: any boy, no matter how humble, who could perform a service the neighboring king could not mock, would receive a pouch of gold.
The decree was read aloud in the village square, and the miller's son heard it while leaning on his axe, having just missed the log again. He dropped the axe, dusted off his trousers, and went straight to the castle gate, thinking not of gold, but of the mocking laughter he always heard. The guards at the gate laughed when he told them his purpose, but the decree was clear, and so, shrugging, they let him pass into the royal presence. The boy bowed low, though somewhat awkwardly, and said, "Your Majesty, I believe I can offer a service your neighbor cannot mock: I will polish your Majesty's boots until they shine like the sun itself." The old king raised a weary eyebrow at this strange offer, considered the state of his much-scuffed boots, and then nodded slowly, saying, "Very well, boy, polish them." The boy fetched polish and rags, and worked all through the night, and by morning the king's old leather boots shone so brightly they seemed made of new gold. When the king saw his boots, he gasped, for he could see his own astonished face reflected perfectly in each toe. Word of the shining boots reached the neighboring king, who scoffed at first, yet when his own boot-polisher tried and failed utterly to achieve such a gleam, he fell silent and could think of no mockery to send. True to his word, the old king gave the boy a heavy pouch filled with gold coins, the first real wealth the miller's son had ever touched. But the neighboring king, though silenced, was not appeased, and soon sent a message demanding a tribute the war-torn kingdom could not possibly pay.
The demand was for one hundred white horses, swift as the wind, when not even ten such horses remained in all the land. The old king tore at his white beard in frustration and went again to the dark mirror in his chamber to consult the wisdom of the dead. His grumpy grandfather's father appeared once more, chewing on a spectral turnip, and said, "White horses? Find the boy who makes boots gleam; perhaps he can polish nags until they turn white!" Though the king thought this advice utter nonsense, he had no better ideas, and so he summoned the miller's son and told him of the impossible demand for one hundred white horses. The boy nodded thoughtfully, looked at his own dusty shoes, and said, "I will try, Your Majesty, but I shall need the oldest, rustiest horseshoe hanging over the castle smithy." The rusty horseshoe was given to him, and the boy went not to the stables, but to the edge of the great forest where the trees grew thick and dark. He struck the rusty horseshoe against the oldest oak tree three times, and smoke puffed from the roots, and the Devil himself stood before him, smelling faintly of sulphur and burnt toast. "Well now, quite a clang you made," the Devil said, fiddling with his pointy tail, "Woke me from my nap! What does a little mortal want with summoning me in the middle of the afternoon?" The boy, remembering the boots more than fearing the fiend, replied simply, "I need one hundred white horses, swift as the wind, delivered to the castle pasture by sunrise." The Devil chuckled, a sound like stones grinding together, "A trifle! Consider it done. In return, you owe me the first laugh you hear on your wedding day – nothing more, nothing less."
At sunrise the next morning, the castle pasture was filled with one hundred horses, gleaming white, snorting impatiently, and pawing the ground with hooves like polished silver. The old king could scarce believe his eyes when he looked from his window, and soon the whole court rejoiced, for the tribute could now be paid. The neighboring king received the hundred white horses with ill grace, staring long at their unnatural brightness, but he could not fault the tribute. The old king, overjoyed, granted the miller's son the finest suit of clothes in the royal wardrobe, made of blue velvet, and gave him a purse that would never be empty, however much was spent. For a time, there was peace in the kingdom, and the miller's son, dressed in his fine blue velvet, learned courtly manners, though he often forgot and absent-mindedly tried to polish the furniture. The princess, however, grew pale and sad, and would speak to no one, often just staring towards the dark forest beyond the kingdom's edge. Seeing his daughter fade, the king grew desperate and sought counsel one last time from the dark mirror, begging his ancestors for a cure for her strange malady. The grumpy ancestor appeared, looking flustered, "Still here? Very well! She stares at the forest, you say? Find someone who has dealings with things *from* the forest; perhaps the shiny-boot boy knows a cure for lovesickness, or wood-sprites, or whatever ails her." The king called for the miller's son, explained the princess's sorrow and the ancestor's peculiar advice, and commanded him to discover the cause of her sadness and cure it if he could. The miller's son agreed readily, asking only that he be allowed to speak with the princess alone in the royal garden where she often walked.
Permission was granted, and the next afternoon, the miller's son found the princess sitting listlessly on a stone bench in the royal garden, feeding crumbs to dusty sparrows. He bowed (remembering this time not to polish the bench) and asked gently, "Your Highness, the king your father is greatly worried; can you tell me what causes your sorrow?" The princess sighed, a sound like wind through dry leaves, and answered, "I long to hear the sound of laughter from a man younger than my father and older than the stable boys, a sound lost to this kingdom these thirty years." The miller's son understood then, for such laughter was indeed a forgotten memory, belonging only to the men swallowed by the long war. He bowed again and left the garden, walking thoughtfully not towards the castle kitchens, but once more towards the great forest and the old oak tree. He took out the rusty horseshoe from his velvet pocket and struck the old oak tree three times, just as before. The puff of smoke was considerably larger this time, and the Devil appeared looking quite cross, "Burning toast again! Can a fiend get no peace? What now, boot-polisher?" "I need," said the miller's son calmly, "to bring the sound of true laughter, from a man neither old nor boyish, to the ears of the princess." The Devil raised a curious eyebrow, then grinned wickedly, "Laughter? That’s rarer than white horses! Done! But for this, the price is steeper: the ring from your little finger on the day you fulfill the first bargain." The Devil snapped his fingers, and suddenly the air in the garden where the princess sat was filled with warm, hearty laughter, the sound echoing as if from a crowd of unseen, happy men of fighting age.
The princess looked up, startled, a faint colour returned to her cheeks, and then, for the first time in many months, she smiled, a true and lovely smile. The king, watching from his window, saw his daughter smile and knew the miller's son had somehow succeeded in this strange task as well. He summoned the youth, who still wore the blue velvet, made him a nobleman on the spot, and gave him fine lands near the royal city, along with a small castle of his own. But the neighboring king heard tell of the princess's recovery and the new nobleman, grew impatient, and sent a herald demanding a contest: his finest champion against theirs, for the princess's hand in marriage. The old king despaired once more, for though he now had a nobleman with inexplicable luck, he still had no champion fit to face a seasoned warrior known for his ferocity. The young nobleman, formerly the miller's son, stepped forward and said calmly, "Your Majesty, I will be your champion." He excused himself from court, went swiftly to the forest edge, and struck the old oak tree the required three times with the rusty horseshoe. The Devil arrived in a cloud of smoke shaped vaguely like a disgruntled badger and sighed, "Let me guess. You need to win a fight against overwhelming odds? Honestly, your kingdom is remarkably needy." "Indeed," the young nobleman replied, ignoring the badger smoke, "I must defeat the neighboring king's champion in single combat tomorrow at noon." "Ah, violence! My favorite kind of favor," the Devil rubbed his hands. "You shall have the strength of ten men and the speed of a hawk, but remember our bargains: the laugh, and the ring!"
The next day at noon, the combat was short; the neighboring king's champion, famed for his might, found himself facing a foe who moved like lightning, and he was disarmed and defeated before he could land a single blow. A great cheer went up from the assembled court and the people of the city, for their unlikely champion had saved the honor of the kingdom and won the princess's hand. The old king, tears of joy streaming down his face, took the princess's hand and placed it in the hand of the young nobleman who had served his kingdom so well. A great wedding feast was prepared, the grandest the kingdom had seen in many years, and all were merry, save perhaps the bridegroom who remembered the Devil's price. During the feast, the court jester, wearing stilts made of sausages for reasons known only to himself, slipped on a dropped grape and landed head-first in the wedding cake. Despite his worry, the sight was so ridiculous that the bridegroom threw back his head and burst into loud, helpless laughter, the first true laugh heard from him. Instantly, the Devil stood beside him, unnoticed by the others still chuckling at the jester, and whispered, "That laugh is mine! And do not forget the ring, nobleman." The bridegroom stopped laughing, turned to the Devil, and said, "You asked for the first laugh I heard on my wedding day, not my own laugh - and the first was surely from the king beside me when the jester fell; take his! As for the ring, I remove it now." The Devil scowled, realizing he had been tricked by the wording about the laugh, snatched the offered ring from the bridegroom's finger, and vanished in a puff of acrid smoke, though faraway cries were later heard, as the ring turned out to be cursed to eternally pinch whoever wore it. And so the young nobleman and the princess ruled wisely after the old king passed, and in time, true laughter returned to the kingdom, along with strong sons and daughters, and the land knew peace and prosperity for many generations.
