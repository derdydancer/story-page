The Saga of the Sausage of Unsurpassed Length
This grand account shall chronicle the extraordinary destiny of a most singular hero, demonstrating how even the humblest of forms, by valor and unwavering self-belief, may achieve the pinnacle of earthly reward and divine notice. Thus, the Sausage of Unsurpassed Length found himself dangling precariously from the talons of a colossal eagle, the wind whistling a dirge against his taut casing. Only hours before, he, the Sausage of Unsurpassed Length, had proclaimed his magnificent proportions to an old oak, sacred to the Sky-Father. Then the Sky-Father himself, disguised as a simple woodsman with an axe glinting like a fallen star, had stepped forth and challenged the boast. If your courage matches your casing, Sausage whose words match his supposed stature,' quoth he, 'then fetch me a feather from the Sun-Eagle's nest on the highest mountain.' The Sausage of Unsurpassed Length, never one to shirk a challenge to his eminence, had readily agreed, his skin fairly gleaming with self-assurance. Yet, no sooner had he set forth towards the distant peaks than a shadow blotted the sun, and a great cry shattered the silence of the ancient woods. The Sun-Eagle, vast as a storm-cloud, descended with the rush of an unseen force, its talons securing the Sausage of Unsurpassed Length before a single squeak of protest could be uttered. This was that same Sun-Eagle, guardian of the Celestial Orbs and the Unspun Fates, whose gaze pierced the veil between worlds. And so he dangled, a most elongated morsel, while far below, the Sky-Father, still in his woodsman's guise, watched with the faintest of smiles playing on his lips.
Upwards they soared, the Sausage of Unsurpassed Length and the Sun-Eagle, until the world spread like a crinkled map far beneath, with threads of rivers and scabs of mountains. He, the Lord of All Links, attempted an indignant wriggle, his muffled remonstrations about undignified travel lost in the rush of celestial air. For the Sky-Father, He Who Sets Stars in Their Courses, was in that very aeon engaged in a subtle dispute with the Earth-Mother, unheard by mortals, concerning the true mettle of unexpectedly shaped heroes. The wind, a boisterous sky-pup, prodded his casing and slapped his ends, showing little respect for his unrivalled roundness. Their destination was a mountain that scraped the belly of the moon, its peak perpetually shrouded, where the Sun-Eagle's nest, woven from lightning-struck pines and solidified cloud-wisps, awaited. An ancient cloud-shepherd, tending his flock of thunderheads, saw them pass and muttered to his wispy beard, 'A dangling omen, that one; the balance of celestial wagers shifts with his shadow.' Meanwhile, the Sausage of Stout Heart, if not of immediate escape, tried to calculate the altitude by the thinning of the air against his finely-ground pork. The mountain peak, a sleeping giant crowned with glaciers, exhaled an icy breath that made even the Sun-Eagle's primary feathers ruffle with respect. Then the Sun-Eagle, He Who Nests Among Forgotten Thunders, uttered a cry like a key turning in a cosmic lock, and they were above the nest. With an imperious flick of its neck, the Sun-Eagle deposited the Sausage of Stout Heart amidst a collection of star-fragments and the polished bones of forgotten heroes.
The Sausage of Unsurpassed Length landed with a soft thud and an ignominious skitter, his considerable body coiling like a startled earthworm. The Sun-Eagle, its voice like the grinding of glaciers, declared, 'From my flank you must take a single plume, shed willingly, to satisfy Him of the Woods.' Each plume upon the Sun-Eagle, He Whose Plumage Outshines Comets, shone like a sword of obsidian, edged with captured dawn-light. Then a fussy chamberlain, a Stoat with spectacles fashioned from frozen dewdrops, scurried forth, twitching his nose at the Sausage of Unsurpassed Length. 'No unauthorized plucking, mind you!' squeaked the Stoat, Adjuster of Nests and Polisher of Talons, 'Dire consequences attend the pilfering of solar plumage!' The Sausage of Unsurpassed Length, attempting a dignified uncoiling, replied, 'My purpose is noble, my reputation impeccable, and my need for a feather divinely sanctioned.' 'Forms in triplicate, that's the procedure,' the Stoat, Compiler of Cloud Inventories, retorted, 'with appropriate celestial seals, or no feather changes possession, divinely sanctioned or not.' During this exchange, the Sun-Eagle, Father of All High-Flying Thoughts, meticulously preened a wing, appearing utterly engrossed in a stray mote of cosmic dust. Suddenly, from behind a particularly large thigh-bone of a hero who tried to steal the moon, emerged another sausage, shorter but undeniably smug: a rival from a distant smokehouse. 'Well, well,' sneered the newcomer, the Sausage of Compact Utility, 'Some of us value efficiency over excessive measurement when it comes to divine appointments.'
The Sausage of Unsurpassed Length felt his casing flush a furious crimson, a rare occurrence usually reserved for overly enthusiastic grilling. 'Audacious tubesteak!' retorted the Sausage of Stout Heart, 'You dare question my eminence? Then let us have a trial of pluck, right here, before the Solar Beak!' The Stoat, Spectacled Adjudicator of All Things Pointless, immediately interposed himself, brandishing a minuscule scroll, 'All trials of pluck require properly notarized contest forms, obtainable from the Ministry of Minor Disputes, sub-level seven of the Cumulus Archive!' A sigh, like wind through a ruined temple gate, issued from the Sun-Eagle, He Who Has Seen Millennia Unfurl Like Cheap Tapestries. 'Enough,' its voice resonated, 'A test of stillness then: the first of you to solicit, by silent merit alone, a feather from my breast before the shadow of yon crag touches that thrice-cursed hero's skull, shall be deemed worthy.' The Sun-Eagle indicated with a subtle nod of its colossal head the aforementioned skull, bleached and grinning, and a sliver of shadow already creeping towards it. The Sausage of Compact Utility, ever quick to seize an apparent advantage, immediately puffed his chest and adopted a pose of what he clearly considered meritorious silence. Our hero, the Sausage of Unsurpassed Length, blinked his casing-ends in thought, then, with an uncharacteristic lack of fanfare, settled himself down to simply be. Far above, in the shimmering aether, the God of Small Wagers nudged the Goddess of Unlikely Victories, and a handful of newly-minted constellations were silently staked. The Stoat, meanwhile, had produced a tiny hourglass filled with diamond dust and was providing an unhelpful commentary on the shadow’s patient advance towards the bone-white skull.
Silence, thick and heavy as a woollen blanket on a summer's day, settled over the Sun-Eagle's nest, punctuated only by the Stoat's intermittent chronometric pronouncements. The Sausage of Compact Utility, He of the Polished End-Caps, began a series of discreet winks and almost imperceptible adjustments to his already ingratiating posture, aimed at the Sun-Eagle's left eye. Our hero, the Sausage of Unsurpassed Length, however, contemplated a particularly resilient patch of lichen on a nearby petrified griffin egg with profound, if un-sausage-like, absorption. The Sun-Eagle, Ancient Observer of Cosmic Tides, blinked one vast, sun-gold eye, slowly, as if processing an aeon of particularly dull data. The Stoat, Official Announcer of Impending Dooms (Minor), cleared his throat and noted, 'The penumbra, gentlemen, exhibits a relentless, serpentine crawl towards the designated cranium.' At this, the Sausage of Compact Utility, He Who Believed Charm Was A Universal Solvent, risked a series of winsome head-tilts and what he hoped was an appealingly vulnerable quiver of his tightly-sealed end. Then, from the Sun-Eagle's breast, gleaming like a sliver of the moon, a single, downy under-feather detached itself as if on its own accord. It executed a languid, spiral descent, catching the ethereal mountain breezes, and drifted directly towards the Sausage of Unsurpassed Length, still lost in his contemplation of primordial lichen. With a tiny, almost inaudible 'phoomp,' the feather, sign of Solar Approbation, landed as softly as a whisper upon the protagonist's unmoving, perfectly rounded middle, just as the Sausage of Compact Utility let out an anguished squeal of thwarted ambition. 'The trial is concluded,' boomed the Sun-Eagle, He Whose Silence Judges Worlds, 'Unadorned stillness has found its mark; the feather is his by merit of un-agitated pork.'
The Sausage of Unsurpassed Length, now also the Sausage Who Mastered Stillness, carefully tucked the sun-kissed feather into a crease in his casing, a faint scent of ozone and ancient starlight clinging to it. As for the Sausage of Compact Utility, He Whose Winks Went Unrewarded, he was unceremoniously bundled up by the Stoat, Bearer of Unsuccessful Contestants, for an ignominious descent via the refuse chute for over-ambitious legumes. The Sun-Eagle, He Who Rewards Quietude With Swift Passage, then offered the Sausage Who Mastered Stillness a return journey, its talons now promising a gentler grip. The descent was a blur of peaks and clouds, and the Sausage Who Carried The Solar Proof felt the very air thrum with what seemed like distant, approving whispers of the Sky-Father's satisfaction. They landed, not with a jolt but with the softness of settled snow, before the sacred oak where the Sky-Father, He of the Patient Disguise, still waited, leaning on his woodsman's axe. With a certain newfound gravity, the Sausage Who Had Conversed With Solar Majesty presented the shimmering plume, its barbs still humming with high-altitude harmonies. The Sky-Father, Keen Appraiser of Plucked Paraphernalia, took the feather, nodded once, a gesture that nonetheless made the ancient oak tremble to its roots. 'Your casing, it seems, does indeed house courage, if not necessarily unparalleled wisdom in choosing conversational partners,' declared the Sky-Father, 'Henceforth, be known also as He Who Dared the Sun-Eagle.' Then the woodsman's humble guise dissolved like mist; his axe became a sceptre of jagged lightning, his roughspun tunic a mantle of thunderclouds, and the Sky-Father stood revealed in awful majesty. With a final, unreadable glance at the Sausage He Who Dared The Sun-Eagle, the Sky-Father, Lord of Tempests and Clear Skies, ascended into the empyrean, leaving only a lingering scent of ozone and a deeply impressed earthworm who had witnessed all.
Many moons waxed and waned, and the Sausage, He Who Dared the Sun-Eagle, though now a figure of some minor local legend amongst the voles and badgers, still found occasion to measure himself against tall trees, noting his Unsurpassed Length with satisfaction. One blustery morning, a harried herald, his trumpet slightly dented, arrived in the district, proclaiming news from the King of the Closest Reasonably Sized Kingdom. The King's only daughter, renowned for her needlepoint and a surprising aptitude for advanced mathematics, had succumbed to a grievous affliction: an incurable excess of seriousness. Whosoever could make the Princess Whose Smiles Were Rarer Than Unicorn Horns laugh thrice before the next new moon would win her hand in marriage and, as was customary, half the kingdom (the half with the better orchards). The Sausage, He Who Measured Merriment by the Metre, considered himself a sausage of considerable talents beyond mere solar audacity, and resolved to try his luck and legendary lengthiness at court. So, He of the Oak-Shaded Origin coiled himself with purpose and began his trek towards the gleaming capital of the King Whose Treasury Was Always Sensibly Audited. His path was soon blocked by a Grumpy Toll-Bridge Troll, guardian of the Bridge of Minimalist Design, who had a strict 'No elongated foodstuff' policy. 'Oi! You! The extended breakfast item!' growled the Troll, He Whose Personal Hygiene Was Universally Criticized, 'Riddle me this, sing me a sea shanty, or offer up a particularly shiny button, for this bridge tolerates no undue protuberances without compensation!' The Sausage, Unwilting Wonder of the Butchers' Art, drew himself up to his full, impressive length and declared, 'I am He Who Dared the Sun-Eagle and Conversed With Solar Majesty; surely such credentials suffice?' The Troll, Known For His Unwavering Adherence to Fee Structures, merely scratched his warty chin and replied, 'Impressive. That and two copper pieces will see you across, Mr. Solar Conversationalist.'
The Sausage, He Whose Pockets Were Notably Absent, found himself in a pickle, for copper pieces were not typically issued to heroes of his particular composition, however lengthy. Then he recalled the feather, the gift of Solar Approbation, still tucked securely, radiating a faint warmth against his perfectly seasoned innards. With delicate precision, using a sharpened pine needle he had kept for emergency sausage-related repairs, He Who Was Surprisingly Resourceful detached a single tiny barb from the magnificent plume. The barb, no bigger than a ladybug's eyelash, glowed with an inner light and hummed with a distant music, like the Sky-Father’s own celestial orchestra tuning up for a particularly triumphant symphony. The Troll, He Whose Aesthetic Sensibilities Were Rarely Consulted, stared at the minuscule marvel, his jaw unhinging like a poorly maintained drawbridge, all thoughts of copper pieces vanishing like dew in a dragon's yawn. 'Pass, Sir Sausage of the Solar Shard!' croaked the Troll, suddenly overcome with an uncharacteristic fit of magnanimity, 'And may your condiments always be complementary!' The Sausage, He Whose Barbs Baffled Bureaucrats, proceeded across the Bridge of Minimalist Design with a majestic undulation, leaving the Troll staring wistfully at the faintly glowing payment. As he journeyed on, a forgotten prophecy, often whispered by wind-chimes made of ancient heroes' teeth in the hermitages of contemplative mountains, began to stir in the collective unconscious of the land: 'When seriousness binds the royal heart, an elongated champion shall play a part, and laughter's cure will prove his art.' He learned from a talkative raven, who was also the region's foremost collector of lost buttons, that many had tried to make the Princess Whose Lips Were Strangers To Mirth smile: a woeful poet, a philosopher with a rubber chicken, and three acrobatic brothers who tragically misjudged the height of the chandelier. Her seriousness, the raven cawed, was a tangible gloom that had caused the Royal Jester to hand in his bauble and take up competitive lamentation, at which he was showing surprising promise.
At last, the Sausage, He Whose Destiny Was Marinated in Mystery, arrived before the gleaming gates of the capital, much to the initial disbelief and subsequent professional poker-faces of the Royal Gatekeepers, men trained to deal with all manner of eccentric petitioners. 'I am the Sausage, He Who Dared the Sun-Eagle and Baffled Bridge Trolls,' he announced with as much baritone as a sausage can muster, 'and I have come to banish the blight of boredom from your princess!' After much hushed consultation involving several raised eyebrows and one dropped monocle, he was granted an audience with the Lord Chamberlain, a man whose face had apparently forgotten how to smile in a previous geological epoch. 'A sausage, you say?' the Lord Chamberlain, Keeper of the Royal Sighs, intoned, his voice drier than a forgotten biscuit. 'We have had jesters, minstrels, philosophers who juggled eels, and even a troupe of kittens in tiny hats. None have succeeded in eliciting so much as a royal snicker.' 'But they, sir,' proclaimed the Sausage, He of Unparalleled Proportions and Unshakable Poise, 'were not sausages of my particular length and legend. I specialize in the unexpected contortion of comedic destiny!' The Lord Chamberlain, Chief Dispenser of Dubious Opportunities, gave a shrug of almost cosmic indifference and sighed, 'Very well, foodstuff. The Princess Whose Countenance Could Curdle Cream awaits. Do not, under any circumstances, get grease on the tapestries.' He was ushered into the Royal Presence Chamber, a vast hall seemingly dimmed by the sheer lack of cheer, where the Princess, a study in unyielding perpendicularity, sat staring at a point slightly to the left of a very mournful-looking tapestry. The King, He Whose Kingdom Suffered from Second-Hand Somberness, announced with a voice like rustling parchment, 'My dear, yet another aspirant to the challenge of your elusive chuckle. This one is... a sausage.' The Princess, Whose Eyebrows Had Never Known Astonishment, did not so much as flicker a lash, her gaze remaining fixed, contemplating, perhaps, the existential angst of a particular thread in the aforementioned tapestry. Undeterred, the Sausage of Unsurpassed Length, He Who Was Now also a Royal Entertainer (Probationary), executed a formal bow, a manoeuvre which, for a creature of his shape and consistency, involved a rather spectacular and undignified looping motion.
Still, the Princess, She Whose Heart Was Barricaded Against Hilarity, registered nothing; her expression remained a perfect monument to solemnity, unmoved by the heroic contortion. Next, the Sausage, Inveterate Showman of the Smokehouse Circuit, launched into a series of increasingly daring acrobatic feats, including balancing on his nether-end upon the Royal Sceptre (borrowed hastily from a dozing King) and juggling three remarkably stale crumpets. Gasps were heard from the assembled courtiers, men and women not easily impressed by daredevil charcuterie, and the Lord Chamberlain, Master of Unflappability, was seen to sway and discreetly sniff a vial of concentrated ennui. The Princess, She Whose Gaze Could Freeze Fire, allowed a brief, thoughtful frown to trouble the perfect stillness of her brow, as if a complex algebraic equation had just stubbed its toe. Unseen by mortal eyes, save perhaps for a particularly perceptive dust-mite, the God of Mischief and Unintended Consequences, disguised as a tiny, almost invisible grease-stain on the Sausage's left flank, gave a subtle, telekinetic nudge. This divine nudge caused the Sausage, He Whose Agility Was Generally Admired (By Himself, Mostly), to execute an unplanned pirouette upon a stray crumpet, sending him skittering wildly towards the Royal Throne. He, the Sausage of Unintended Aerodynamics, caromed off a gilded table leg, performed an involuntary triple-somersault, and landed with a resounding 'thwack' directly in the King's ample lap, knocking the Royal Crown askew over one royal eye. The King, He Whose Dignity Was Usually Impregnable, blinked in sausage-induced astonishment, his crown now resembling a rather avant-garde golden fascinator. And then it happened: a sound like a rusty hinge creaking, then a strangled snort, and finally, the Princess Whose Seriousness Was Legendary, threw back her head and let out a clear, bright peal of laughter that echoed off the very serious rafters. A collective sigh of relief, so profound it momentarily reversed the direction of the draft from the main door, swept through the chamber; the Lord Chamberlain openly wept into his meticulously ironed handkerchief, and the Sausage, He of the Accidental Triumph, puffed with justifiable, if slightly dazed, pride.
The King, He Whose Royal Funny Bone Had Been Rediscovered, beamed, clapped the Sausage heartily on the back (a somewhat hollow sound), and declared, 'Magnificent, my dear fellow, simply magnificent! One laugh down, the kingdom is practically yours!' The Princess, However, She Whose Laughter Was But a Fleeting Visitor, quickly composed herself into a state of thoughtful sobriety, remarking, 'Fascinating. The interplay of kinetic energy and unexpected percussive impact on established dignity can, it appears, trigger an involuntary spasmodic diaphragmatic response.' The Sausage, He Who Now Faced The Perils of Princessly Pedantry, realized he needed a new approach, and began to consult his inner sausage-sense for inspiration of a less accidental nature. His gaze fell upon the Royal Parrot, a magnificent creature known as 'He Who Squawks Uncomfortable Truths At Inopportune Moments,' currently dozing on a perch made from a previous, very serious philosopher's femur. A mischievous glint, possibly reflecting the lingering influence of the God of Unintended Consequences, sparked in the Sausage's eye; he sidled over to the perch and, in a series of complex squeaks and persuasive wriggles, taught the parrot a simple, yet profoundly absurd phrase: 'The kumquat wears a bowler hat!' Later, as the King, He Whose Speeches Often Induced Narcolepsy, was delivering a particularly lengthy address on the proper quarterly rotation of palace doilies, the parrot, with impeccable comic timing, suddenly shrieked, 'The kumquat wears a bowler hat!' A stunned silence, then a gasp from the Princess, a surprised snort, and then a glorious, full-throated, entirely un-princessly guffaw that made the very serious tapestries ripple as if in a gleeful breeze. Even the King, He Whose Doily Directives Were Usually Sacrosanct, chuckled until his (now correctly positioned) crown wobbled, while the Sausage, Master of Avian Absurdity, permitted himself a small, satisfied wiggle of triumph. 'Remarkable,' gasped the Princess, wiping a tear from her eye, 'The unexpected juxtaposition of mundane fruit with incongruous haberdashery, enunciated by a psittacine source, appears to possess inherent comedic potential. Hypothesis confirmed.' The Sausage, He Who Was Becoming Quite The Royal Comedian, knew the third laugh, the one to win the kingdom and the lady, must be different: it had to be from the heart, not just the head or the surprised diaphragm.
He pondered deeply, executing a slow, contemplative rotation on the royal rug, a manoeuvre that, to the casual observer, might have resembled a sausage thoughtfully considering its own existential circularity. Then, an idea sparked: he would simply recount his own recent adventures – the boast, the Sky-Father, the Sun-Eagle, the officious Stoat, the rival sausage – with simple, unvarnished frankness, letting the inherent absurdity of a heroic sausage speak for itself. And so he began, in a surprisingly resonant voice for one of his composition, detailing the indignities of eagle-travel, the pedantry of celestial bureaucrats, and the sheer audacity of smug, shorter sausages, all with a matter-of-fact tone that highlighted the epic ridiculousness of it all. The Princess, She Whose Ears Were Unaccustomed to Such Sagas of Seasoning, listened with an attentiveness that slowly, almost imperceptibly, began to soften the severe lines around her mouth; a tiny quiver appeared at one corner. When he reached the part about the Stoat demanding forms in triplicate for a single feather from the Sun-Eagle itself, detailing the exact sub-clause regarding inter-species plumage transfer, the quiver became a definite twitch. And as he described his own earnest attempt to explain 'divine sanction' to the spectacles of the Stoat, the Princess, She Whose Joy Had Lain Dormant For Ages, let out a laugh that started in her toes, rumbled through her royal person, and shook her very crown with its unrestrained, heartfelt, and utterly delightful power. The King, He Who Was Now Thoroughly Un-Somber, wept with joy, the courtiers cheered, and the Royal Parrot, catching the mood, repeatedly squawked, 'The kumquat wears a bowler hat to the wedding!' So the Sausage, He Whose Laughter Healed a Kingdom, was married to the Princess, She Whose Chuckles Now Outnumbered Her Calculations, in a ceremony of great pomp and surprising amounts of mustard, and as the wedding feast commenced, a radiant light filled the hall, and the Sky-Father himself appeared, no longer disguised. 'Behold!' boomed the Sky-Father, Lord of All Beginnings and Endings, 'How an unlikely hero, through valor, a stout heart, and a profound understanding of the absurd, can restore balance and win the highest prize. Truly, length is commendable, but heart and humor conquer all!' And so the Sausage and the Princess lived happily, if somewhat unconventionally, ever after, ruling wisely and with much laughter, and their many and variedly shaped children were all, without exception, remarkably fond of mustard and epic tales of their father, the Sausage of Unsurpassed Length, Stout Heart, and Legendary Laughs.
