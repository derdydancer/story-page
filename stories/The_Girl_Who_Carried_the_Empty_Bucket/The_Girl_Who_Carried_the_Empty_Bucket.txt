The Girl Who Carried the Empty Bucket
There was once a village beside a dry river.
Water was scarce, and the people fetched it from a deep well far up the stony hill.
A certain poor woman had a daughter named Lina.
Lina was not clever, nor was she strong, but she was good-hearted and always did as she was bid.
One morning, her mother said, "Lina, the water jar is empty.
Go now to the well on the hill and bring water, for I must make the bread."
So Lina took the heavy clay jar and went forth.
The path was steep, and the sun was hot.
She walked slowly.
Halfway up the hill, she saw an old man sitting by the path.
He looked very thirsty.
His face was grey, and his lips were cracked.
"Child," he croaked, his voice like dry leaves, "have you any water?
Just a drop for an old man."
Lina looked at her empty jar.
"I have naught, good father," she said sadly.
"I go now to fetch water from the well."
The old man sighed.
"Ah, the well is far, and my legs are weak.
But perhaps," he said, looking sharply at her empty jar, "perhaps you carry something else I need."
Lina was puzzled.
"But the jar is empty," she replied.
"Is it truly empty?"
asked the man.
"Or does it carry the promise of water?"
Lina did not understand his words, but she felt pity for him.
She thought, "He is old and thirsty. Even if I have no water, I can give him comfort."
So she stopped and sat beside him.
She spoke kindly to him and told him about her village and her mother.
She wiped the dust from his brow with the edge of her apron.
She offered him the shady spot where she had been standing.
She did this not for gain, but because her heart was good.
After a time, the old man stood up.
He looked less grey.
"You have given me something better than water, child," he said.
"You gave kindness when you had naught else to give. Now, look inside your jar."
Lina peered into the jar.
It was filled to the brim with cool, clear water. She gasped.
"Go now," said the old man. "And remember, an empty hand given with kindness is sometimes fuller than a fist full of gold."
Then the old man vanished.
Lina did not know where he went.
She lifted the jar, which now felt light as a feather, and hurried back down the hill.
Her mother was amazed to see her return so soon with the jar full.
From that day on, whenever Lina went to fetch water, the jar never felt heavy, and there was always enough for whoever asked kindly along the way.
