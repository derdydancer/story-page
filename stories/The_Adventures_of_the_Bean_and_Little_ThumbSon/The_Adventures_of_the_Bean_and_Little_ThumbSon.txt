The Adventures of the Bean and Little Thumb-Son
There was once a single bean that lay forgotten on a dusty shelf. Then one day came a mouse, and it spied the bean, and seized it in its teeth. So the mouse scurried away to its hole in the wall, for it meant to feed the bean to its little ones. But as it passed the hearth, a great ginger cat pounced upon the mouse. The cat bit its head off in an instant, and the mouse was dead, and the bean rolled away under a loose floorboard. There it lay in the dark and damp, and for many days no creature came near it. Then a poor woman who dwelt in that cottage was sweeping her floor, and she swept the bean out with the dust. She looked at it, but saw it was only a common bean, and so she cast it out of the door into her little patch of garden. The bean fell upon the soft earth, and presently the rain came down and watered it. So the bean began to sprout, and it grew upwards until it was a tall stalk with many green leaves.
And on this stalk grew one single, great bean-pod, fat and green. Then the poor woman saw the great pod hanging on the stalk in her garden. She said to herself, that is a wondrous pod, I will pick it and see what is inside. So she cut it open, and inside there were no beans at all, but a little droll-looking man, no bigger than her thumb. The little man blinked his eyes and said, good woman, let me out of this pod, if you please. The poor woman was greatly amazed, but she did as he asked and opened the pod wider. The little man jumped out onto her hand, and said, because you have freed me, I shall make you rich, but first you must bring me a thimbleful of morning dew. The woman, thinking of riches, readily agreed and went at once to fetch a thimble. She went into her garden where the dew still lay upon the cabbage leaves, and carefully she gathered it, drop by drop. Then she returned and gave it to the little man, who was waiting on her kitchen table.
The little man drank the thimbleful of dew at one gulp, and then he spat out a shining gold coin upon the table. Do this every morning, said he, and every morning I shall give you a gold coin, but tell no one of my existence. So the poor woman did as he bade, and every day she gathered the dew, and every day she had a new gold coin. But she had a greedy neighbor, a stout woman with a wart on her nose, who saw that the poor woman was no longer poor, and wondered whence her good fortune came. So the neighbor came to the cottage one day, and spoke sweetly to the woman, asking how she had come by such good fortune. The woman remembered the little man's command and told her neighbor nothing of the thimble of dew or the gold coins. But the greedy neighbor was not to be put off, and the next morning she hid herself behind the woman's water-butt. From there, she saw the woman gather the dew, enter the cottage, and then she peered through a crack in the shutter and saw the little man, and saw him spit the coin. Aha! said the greedy neighbor to herself, now I know her secret, and tomorrow I shall have a gold coin too. So the next morning, when the first woman had gone to the well for water, the greedy neighbor crept into the cottage and seized the little man from the table.
Now, little imp, said she, holding him tight, you shall do for me what you did for her, so spit me a coin at once! But the little man said, I will not, for you are not the good woman who set me free and gave me dew. The greedy neighbor was enraged at this, and she dashed the little man against the stone hearth with all her might. The little man was gone, and in his place on the floor sat a great, warty toad. The toad gave a great croak, jumped upon her face, and when she tore it off, her nose and cheeks were covered with a hundred new warts. When the first woman returned, she found the little man gone, and she wept, for she knew her greedy neighbor must have taken him. However, she had by now enough gold coins stored away to live in comfort for the rest of her days. As for the greedy neighbor, her warts grew worse with each passing day, and soon no one would come near her house. And the beanstalk in the garden, having produced its single wondrous pod, withered and died. And so the first woman lived well, whilst her neighbor lived in warty misery, and that was the end of that.
Many years passed, and in a grand kingdom not far from that cottage, there lived a King and Queen who grieved, for they had no child. Oh, that I might have a child, the Queen often said, I would love it dearly, even if it were a toad from a muddy pond! One day, as she walked in the palace gardens, an old woman with a basket of herbs passed by and heard her lament. The old woman curtsied and said, Your Majesty, take a single dry bean, plant it in a silver pot by the light of the full moon, and your wish may be granted. The Queen, eager to try anything, thanked the old woman, procured a silver pot and a dry bean, and that very night she planted it by the full moon's light. By morning it had sprouted, and it grew wondrously fast, and by noon it bore a single perfect flower, like a white and crimson cup. As the Queen watched, the flower opened its petals, and within lay a tiny babe, no bigger than her husband's thumb, but perfectly formed and beautiful. The King and Queen rejoiced greatly, and they loved the thumb-sized child with all their hearts, and called him nothing but 'Little Thumb-Son'. Though he was so small, the Little Thumb-Son was clever and nimble, and quick in all his ways. When he was seven years old, he said to his parents, I love you dearly, but I wish to go out and see the wide world.
The King and Queen's hearts were heavy, for he was very small to face the dangers of the road, but they agreed to let him go. So they had a tiny sword made from a sewing needle and a little helmet from a silver thimble, and they kissed him goodbye. Little Thumb-Son set off, and soon he came upon a great black dung beetle trundling a ball of dung, and he said, good sir beetle, will you give me a ride? The beetle waggled its antennae and replied, I have no time for passengers, I am taking this important ball to my burrow, and continued on its way. So Little Thumb-Son walked on, and next he met a snail, and asked the same, and the snail agreed, for it was not in a hurry. He climbed upon the snail's pearly shell, and they travelled for a whole day and a whole night, and covered the distance of three cabbage patches. Then, as they were crossing a wide meadow, a great stork with long legs and a sharp beak landed nearby, looking for its breakfast. The stork spied the juicy snail, and before Little Thumb-Son could cry out, it plucked the snail from the ground and swallowed it whole, shell and all. So Little Thumb-Son found himself inside the stork's craw, which was dark and slimy and smelly. I may be small, thought Little Thumb-Son, but I have my needle-sword, and he began to poke and prick the inside of the stork's craw.
The stork felt a terrible tickling and pricking inside, and it began to feel mightily unwell. It flew high into the air, and then, seeking to rid itself of the discomfort, it landed on a barren mountain peak, beside a hermit's lonely stone cell, and coughed. With a great retch, the stork coughed up the snail's shell, and Little Thumb-Son tumbled out with it, right at the hermit's doorway. The hermit, who was a very old man with a beard as white as snow and eyes as grey as the storm clouds, emerged from his cell and looked down. Well now, little morsel, said the hermit in a voice like dry leaves rustling, whence comest thou, and why dost thou disturb my long contemplation of the First Bean? Little Thumb-Son, not understanding this strange question about a bean, told the hermit of his journey from the palace, and his adventure with the snail and the stork. Aha! said the hermit, then thou art thyself a child of the bean, a sprout from a forgotten lineage, just as I am a guardian of its memory. For I am the Guardian of the First Bean's Echo, and all who spring from its kind are known to me, from the moment they lie on a dusty shelf to the time they are swallowed by storks. Little Thumb-Son understood none of this, for he was only a very small boy, though a brave one. The hermit smiled faintly and said, No matter, little sprout; for now, be so good as to fetch me a cup of water from the spring that trickles behind my cell, for my old bones are weary.
So Little Thumb-Son, glad to be of service, took the hermit's tiny wooden cup and went to find the spring. He found the spring easily, but a large, fat bumblebee with a voice like a tiny trumpet was hovering over it, and it buzzed fiercely, This is my spring, go away! Little Thumb-Son replied politely, I mean no harm, I only need a little water for the good hermit who lives on this mountain. But the bumblebee cared not for hermits and charged at Little Thumb-Son, intending to sting him soundly on the nose. Little Thumb-Son, however, was quick; he ducked, and the bumblebee's sting struck the silver thimble-helmet with a great thwack, thwack, and the sting broke off. The bumblebee buzzed in pain and fury, for its good sting was ruined, and it flew away into the sky as fast as it could. Then Little Thumb-Son filled the tiny wooden cup with clear spring water and carried it carefully back to the hermit's cell. The hermit took the cup, but instead of drinking, he gazed into the water for a long time as if it were a seeing-glass. At last he looked up and said, Little Thumb-Son, your path is long yet, and I see a king's table, a lost slipper, and much gold before you are done. Now go your way, for the world awaits, and the echo of the Bean is restless in you.
So Little Thumb-Son thanked the hermit and climbed down the barren mountain, and after many days of travel, he came to a great castle where a king was holding a feast. He was so tiny that he slipped under the great door of the hall unnoticed by the guards. Inside, all was noise and merriment, and Little Thumb-Son, seeking a safe place to watch, climbed up a table leg and hid himself within an empty wine jug. From there he saw the King on his high throne, and beside him the Princess, who was fair to see but looked sad, for she had lost her little glass slipper that very morning. The King proclaimed to all the knights and nobles present, Whosoever finds my daughter's lost glass slipper shall have her hand in marriage and half my kingdom! Little Thumb-Son heard this from inside the wine jug and thought, Though I am small, perhaps I can find this slipper, for the hermit spoke of it. Just then, a clumsy servant came to the table, picked up the very jug Little Thumb-Son was in, and tried to pour wine from it, but found it empty. As the servant peered inside, Little Thumb-Son, fearing discovery, suddenly cried out, Cock-a-doodle-doo, like a rooster at dawn! The servant, who was very superstitious, yelped in terror, thinking the jug was bewitched, and dropped it with a crash upon the stone floor. The jug shattered into a thousand pieces, and in the ensuing surprise and confusion, Little Thumb-Son scampered away unseen beneath the tables and chairs.
Then he began his search, looking into every nook and cranny for the Princess's lost glass slipper. He crept under the King's great feasting table, and there he saw the King's own fat, lazy cat, which opened one sleepy eye and twitched its tail at the sight of such a tiny morsel. Quickly, Little Thumb-Son said, Good Puss, if you let me pass, I shall tell you where the cook has hidden a whole string of fresh sausages in the pantry! The cat's other eye opened wide at the thought of sausages, and it licked its lips and immediately padded off towards the kitchens, forgetting all about Little Thumb-Son. Little Thumb-Son hurried on, and at last, under a dusty side-bench, tucked inside a sleeping squire's muddy boot, he found the little glass slipper. It was as clear as crystal and as delicate as a dream, but it was also surprisingly heavy for one so small, and he could not lift it. Just then, a family of mice scurried past, and Little Thumb-Son called to them, Good mice, if you help me carry this slipper to the Princess, I shall reward you with all the cheese from the King's pantry you can eat! The mice, who were always hungry, squeaked with delight, and together, with much puffing and pulling, they dragged the glass slipper across the great hall to the foot of the King's throne. Little Thumb-Son bowed low and announced, Your Royal Highness, I believe this is your lost slipper! The Princess cried out with joy, and the King was struck with wonder. And so the King gave his daughter's hand to Little Thumb-Son, who became Prince Thumb, and they lived happily; and some say the old hermit on the mountain, Guardian of the First Bean's Echo, smiled that day, knowing another cycle was well complete.
