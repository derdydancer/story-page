Create an image of the following story in the style of a children's book illustration.

There was once a single bean that lay forgotten on a dusty shelf. Then one day came a mouse, and it spied the bean, and seized it in its teeth. So the mouse scurried away to its hole in the wall, for it meant to feed the bean to its little ones. But as it passed the hearth, a great ginger cat pounced upon the mouse. The cat bit its head off in an instant, and the mouse was dead, and the bean rolled away under a loose floorboard. There it lay in the dark and damp, and for many days no creature came near it. Then a poor woman who dwelt in that cottage was sweeping her floor, and she swept the bean out with the dust. She looked at it, but saw it was only a common bean, and so she cast it out of the door into her little patch of garden. The bean fell upon the soft earth, and presently the rain came down and watered it. So the bean began to sprout, and it grew upwards until it was a tall stalk with many green leaves.
