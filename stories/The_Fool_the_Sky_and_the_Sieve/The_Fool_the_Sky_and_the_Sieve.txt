The Fool, the Sky, and the Sieve
There was once a youth, who was a great fool, and when the sky was wont to fall, he always ran to catch it in a sieve. His father and mother shook their heads at such folly, and gave him naught but watery soup for his meals. Now it happened often that the sky would fall, and great blue pieces like broken plates would smash the cabbages in the garden and frighten the chickens in the yard. The King of that land, much troubled by this, sent forth a herald with a trumpet to all the towns and villages. The herald proclaimed that whosoever could find a way to stop the sky from falling should have the King's daughter to wife and half of the kingdom besides. Many a brave knight and clever scholar heard this, and they tried their best, but none could do it. When the fool youth heard the proclamation, he clapped his hands and said to himself, "That is a task for me!" So he took his sieve, put it on his head like a helmet, and set off towards the King's palace, whistling a merry tune. The people in the towns and villages saw him pass with his sieve-helmet and, when he told them his purpose, they laughed and pointed, saying, "Do you mean to catch the sky in that?" But the youth only nodded gravely and replied, "Indeed I do!" and walked on.
At last he came to the King's palace and banged upon the great gate with his sieve until the guards came out. The guards, who were sturdy fellows with fierce moustaches, opened the gate a crack and asked, "What means this clamour, fool?" "I am come to stop the sky from falling, as the King has proclaimed," said the youth, "and to win the princess and half the kingdom." The guards burst into loud laughter, and one said, "With that colander on your head, you mean?" and they laughed so hard that one of them dropped his spear with a clang. The King, who was walking in his rose garden nearby, heard the clang and the laughter, and sent a page to ask what was amiss, and then commanded, "Bring the fellow hither." So the youth was brought before the King, who looked him up and down with a stern eye but a twitch at his lips, and asked, "Is it true that you believe you can stop the sky from falling with naught but a sieve?" "That I do, your Majesty," replied the youth earnestly, "for the sky is full of holes, like my sieve, and one must fight like with like!" The King, for reasons of his own, did not laugh aloud but stroked his beard and said, "Perhaps you are right; yet first, to prove your cleverness, you must fetch me the three golden hairs from the chin of the slumbering giant who lives under the waterfall at the world's edge." For the King secretly thought that this giant, whose snores were said to shake the mountains, might well be the one causing the sky to tremble and fall with his great rumblings, or at least, that the fool would trouble him no more. "That I will do gladly!" cried the youth, and forgetting all about his sieve for the moment, he set off at once to find the world's edge.
He walked for many days and many nights, until he came to a barren land where no birds sang and the wind whispered strange secrets. There, by a twisted thorn-bush, he saw a great grey wolf with its paw caught fast in a cruel hunter's trap, and it was howling mournfully. Now, though the youth was a fool, he had a kind heart, and he knelt by the wolf and worked at the trap with his hands until he set the paw free. The wolf licked its paw and then spoke in a deep voice, saying, "You have saved me, kind youth, when others would have passed by or struck me. Tell me, whither do you journey, and I will serve you?" "I must journey to the world's edge," said the youth, "to fetch three golden hairs from the chin of a slumbering giant who dwells beneath a waterfall, a task given by my King." "That is a perilous road indeed," said the wolf, its eyes gleaming, "but I know the way. Climb upon my back, hold fast, and shut your eyes until I bid you open them." The youth did as he was bidden, and climbed upon the wolf's broad, grey back, clinging to its thick fur. Then the wolf ran, faster than any horse, so fast that the wind whistled in the youth's ears and the trees and mountains seemed to fly past like shadows. After a time that seemed both long and short, the wolf stopped and said, "Now you may open your eyes; we are here." The youth looked and saw they stood at the foot of great black cliffs, from which a mighty waterfall plunged into a churning pool with a roar like thunder, and the water itself was as dark as night.
"The giant slumbers deeply now, behind that curtain of water," whispered the wolf. "You must pass behind the fall, tread softly, and pluck three hairs from his chin, one by one; but if he wakes, all is lost." The youth nodded, his face pale but determined in the dim light, and then he took a deep breath and slipped behind the thundering water. There, in a vast, damp cave, lay the giant, vaster than any mountain the youth had ever seen, and his breath came and went like a storm wind, shaking the very rock. The youth tiptoed to the giant's great chin, which was like a mossy boulder, and gently plucked one shimmering golden hair; it shone faintly even in the gloom. The giant grumbled in his sleep, a sound like distant thunder, and one great eyelid fluttered, but he did not wake. The youth held his breath, his heart beating like a drum against his ribs, and when all was still again, he reached out and plucked the second golden hair. This time the giant snorted loudly, like a bellows, and turned his great head so that his chin was almost upon the youth, and loose pebbles clattered down from the cave roof; the youth froze like a stone. Knowing it was now or never, the youth, with a silent prayer on his lips, darted his hand out, plucked the third golden hair, just as the giant’s eyes began to open like fiery pits. He did not wait to see more but scrambled back behind the waterfall as swift as a weasel, the three hairs clutched tightly in his hand. He burst out into the dim light and found the great grey wolf waiting patiently for him, to whom he cried, "I have them!" and the wolf nodded its great head gravely.
"Well done, brave fool," said the wolf, a smile in its yellow eyes. "Climb upon my back once more, and again shut your eyes, for the return is often swifter, but no less strange." Again the youth obeyed, and the wolf sped through the barren lands and the forests beyond, so quickly this time that the wind itself seemed to sleep in their passage. Before the youth knew it, the wolf halted at the edge of the forest nearest the King's city and said, "I can take you no further. Go now, and deliver the hairs." The youth thanked the wolf with all his heart, and the wolf replied, "If ever you have sore need of me again, come to this spot and call my name thrice." Then it vanished into the trees like a grey shadow. The youth made his way to the King's palace, and when he was brought before the King, he held out his hand and said, "Your Majesty, here are the three golden hairs from the giant's chin." The King and all his court were greatly amazed, for they had thought the giant would surely devour him, or that he would perish on the way. "You have done well, youth," said the King, hiding his surprise. "As for the sky, it has not fallen much of late, so there is no great hurry. We shall see what use you can be put to in the meantime." So the youth was made an under-keeper of the King's geese, to help the old woman who usually tended them in the water-meadows beyond the palace walls. The youth did not complain but undertook his duties cheerfully, and it was said that never had the King's geese been so fat, nor their eggs so plentiful, as when he helped to watch them. Now, the King's daughter was wont to walk in the afternoons with her little white dog in these same water-meadows where the geese were kept.
One afternoon, as she walked, a great piece of the sky came down, but this piece was not blue and brittle like the others, but soft and white as a new fleece; it settled over her gently, like a great soft feather-bed, and then rose up high into the air, carrying the princess with it. The princess cried out in fear, and her little dog barked, and her attendants ran about below, wringing their hands and shouting advice, but the white sky-piece was too high for any ladder and too soft for any arrow. Word was brought swiftly to the King, who tore at his beard in grief and sent heralds out again to proclaim that whosoever brings his daughter safely down from the white sky-piece shall surely have her to wife, and the whole kingdom when I am gone! Again, many brave knights and clever men tried all manner of schemes, with ropes and nets and great fans to blow the sky-piece, but none could devise a way to reach her, for the cloud was without hold or purchase. The fool youth, watching the geese in the meadow, saw the princess weeping on her white perch among the clouds, and he saw the King’s sorrow, and he said to the old goose-woman, "Grandmother, I will try to bring her down." The old goose-woman, who was old and wrinkled but her eyes were sharp, looked at him and said, "Take this ordinary grey goose feather, child. Go to the highest hill, hold it up, and call to the wind as if it were your brother who plays too roughly." The youth took the feather, though he did not understand, and climbed the highest hill he could find nearby, which was green and round against the troubled sky. There he held up the grey goose feather and called out in his clear voice, "Oh, brother Wind, you play too roughly with the King’s daughter! Be gentler, I pray you!" Scarcely had he spoken when a sighing arose in the trees, and a gentle breeze touched his face, then a steady current of air flowed upwards towards the white sky-piece, which began to drift slowly downwards towards the earth. Lower and lower it came, until it settled as softly as a falling leaf in the meadow, and the princess stepped out from it, a little dizzy but unharmed, and the youth ran to her side.
"It is you, good goose-herd!" cried the princess, her eyes wide with wonder. "You have saved me when all others failed!" And she took his hand in hers. Just then, the King and all his court, who had seen the white sky-piece descending, came rushing to the spot and when they saw the princess safe, they rejoiced greatly, and the King declared, "A King keeps his word!" And so he announced to all that this youth, the King's goose-herd, who was once called a fool, shall have his daughter to wife, and the kingdom after me, for he has saved us all! A great feast was prepared, and the youth was dressed in silken robes, and his old father and mother were sent for, who wept with joy and could scarce believe their eyes that their fool son was to be a King. In the midst of the rejoicing, the great grey wolf walked into the hall, unafraid and noble to see, and all fell silent. "Brave youth, now King-to-be," said the wolf, its voice clear as a bell, "know that I too was under an enchantment, a prince of a far northern land, and your kindness in freeing me from the trap also broke the spell upon me." And as he spoke, the wolf shimmered and changed, and before them stood a handsome young prince in gleaming silver armour, who held out a smooth blue stone, saying, "This is my wedding gift. As long as this stone lies on the King's throne, the sky will remain whole above this land." All the court gasped at this marvel, and the King took the stone with reverence, and the new prince was welcomed as a brother. And so the youth who was once a fool, married the princess and in time became a wise King, and the sky troubled them no more, and they lived happily for many long years. And as for his old sieve, they say he kept it polished bright and sometimes wore it tilted just so, for a King may wear what crown he pleases, and his was a sieve that had, after all, set him on his way.
