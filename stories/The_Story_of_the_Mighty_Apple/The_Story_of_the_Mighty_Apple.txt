The Story of the Mighty Apple
There was once a poor man who had naught but a little cottage and a stony field behind it. One morning, as the sun rose, a mighty apple, as red as blood and bigger than the man’s own head, fell from the sky and landed right in the middle of his stony field. Where it landed the stones vanished, the earth turned rich and black, and corn grew instantly as tall as a man’s waist, though it was not the season for it. The poor man stood amazed for a time, then he took his sickle and cut the corn, which filled his little cottage to the rafters. But news of such a marvel travels fast, and soon the King of that land heard of the poor man’s field and the mighty apple, and he rode out with his court to see. The King saw the mighty apple gleaming in the field, and the field overflowing with grain where before there were stones, and he greatly desired the apple for himself. He said to the poor man, "Fellow, that apple is too great a thing for your humble field; it belongs in my royal garden. Give it to me." The poor man trembled, but his son, who was held to be simple, stepped forward and said, "Lord King, the apple fell here; perhaps it means to stay here." The King scowled, for he was not used to being gainsaid, yet he knew not what to answer the simple lad, so he rode back to his palace in a temper to take counsel. Now, the King took counsel from a crooked dwarf who lived under the castle stairs and was known to be full of wicked tricks more than wisdom.
The dwarf rubbed his hands and said, "Offer the poor man's son seeds that glitter like gold, and tell him they will grow into stalks of pure gold if planted where the apple lies, once the apple is removed." "But," the dwarf sniggered, "the seeds will truly grow naught but chattering weeds that make a racket day and night, and will drive the lad mad or make him give up the field!" This counsel pleased the King, who desired the apple greatly and cared little for the poor man or his son, so he gave the dwarf a pouch of glittering seeds and sent him to the field. The dwarf hobbled to the field where the simple son kept watch over the apple, and holding out the pouch, he said, "Lad, the King offers you these magic seeds that grow pure gold, in fair exchange for that overgrown fruit." The simple son looked closely at the seeds, then at the mighty apple, and then at the corn filling his father’s cottage, and said, "Gold stalks? Can one eat gold? This apple helps grow good corn. Your seeds seem useless." The dwarf stamped his foot in fury, for he had expected the lad to be greedy, and he angrily threw the seeds away onto the edge of the field, close by the border of the neighbouring kingdom. At once there sprang up hideous weeds with mouths like bells, and they chattered and clacked day and night, making a dreadful noise. The simple son and his father stuffed their ears with moss and were not overly troubled, but the noise was great across the border and chiefly troubled the folk in the neighbouring kingdom. The King of that neighbouring land soon heard the constant clatter from his border and was greatly vexed by this plague of noisy weeds. He proclaimed that whoever could rid his land of the chattering weeds would receive a great reward of silver and fine cloth.
The simple son heard of this proclamation and thought the silver and cloth would be useful, so he decided he might try to silence the weeds. He first went with a scythe and cut down all the weeds along the border, but they grew back instantly and chattered even louder than before. Next he tried digging them up by the roots, but the roots writhed like snakes, spat dirt at him, and jumped right back into the earth when he pulled them out. The simple son scratched his head, puzzled, then he looked at the mighty apple still gleaming in his field and thought, "Perhaps the apple knows what these weeds dislike." He took a handful of the rich black earth from right beside the apple, went to the border, and rubbed it onto the mouths of the chattering weeds. At once their mouths clamped shut as if locked, and they swiftly withered away to dust, leaving blessed silence. The neighbouring King soon learned the noise had stopped and who had done it, and he sent for the simple son to give him the promised reward. The King gave him a great pile of silver until he could carry no more, and ten bolts of fine blue cloth besides. The simple son returned home and shared the silver and cloth with his father, and they lived in comfort for the first time. But the King of the land soon heard how the simple son had gained a great reward from his neighbour for silencing the weeds his own dwarf had sown.
The crooked dwarf under the stairs heard this too, and he grew more furious than ever and determined to get the mighty apple for himself, no matter the cost. He crept out at midnight and stood far off, muttering a wicked spell, and the mighty apple in the field began to shrink smaller and smaller. The simple son, who now watched the field closely, saw the apple shrinking down and was alarmed, for he knew the field’s richness came from it. He ran to the well behind the cottage, fetched clear water in his cap, and carefully poured it over the shrinking apple. The apple instantly stopped shrinking and quickly grew back to its mighty size, red and gleaming as before. The dwarf, hiding behind a bush, saw this and hopped upon his crooked legs with rage that his spell was undone by mere water. He resolved on bolder mischief, thinking, "If I cannot get the apple while the lad guards it, I shall steal the lad himself!" So the next night, he crept up while the simple son slept beside the apple tree that had grown from the first fallen seed, blew a sleeping dust upon him, and when the lad fell fast asleep, the dwarf slung him over his shoulder and carried him off towards his gloomy mountain home. In the morning, the poor father found him gone, saw the dwarf's crooked footprints in the earth, and wept bitterly, for he knew mischief was done and his simple, clever son was lost. Meanwhile, the simple son awoke with a headache in the dwarf's dark cave high in the mountains, surrounded by piles of treasure but locked behind thick iron bars.
The crooked dwarf stood before the bars and snarled, "Now, simpleton, you will tell me the apple's secret! How do you make it work its magic?" The simple son replied truthfully, "I know no secret, master dwarf. The apple just is, and the earth near it helps things." "Liar!" shrieked the dwarf. "You guard it, so you know! Since you will not tell, you shall sort this pile of treasure – every gold coin from silver, every ruby from emerald, and every lost button from them all – before dawn, or you will suffer!" The dwarf locked the cave door, leaving the simple son alone with the glittering mountain of treasure; the lad knew he could never finish the task by dawn, but his first thought was, "I am hungry." He looked about for a crust of bread the dwarf might have left, and amongst the gold and jewels, his hand fell upon a small whistle made of plain wood, tucked away as if forgotten. Having naught else to do while waiting for his doom, he put the whistle to his lips and blew a clear, simple note. Instantly, hundreds of mountain mice with bright eyes peered from cracks in the cave walls, summoned by the whistle's sound, known only to them. The simple son pointed to the pile, and the mice seemed to understand, for they set to work with their nimble paws, sorting gold from silver, gem from gem, and button from button with marvellous speed. Long before dawn, the great pile was gone, replaced by neat piles of gold, silver, gems of each kind, and a comical little heap of buttons. When the dwarf came back at dawn, expecting to punish the lad, his eyes popped to see the task finished perfectly, down to the silly pile of buttons, and he gasped and screeched with fury.
Having no reason now to punish him yet too angry to let him go, the dwarf just slammed the door and locked it again, but in his rage he forgot all about the plain whistle the lad still held. The simple son wasted no time and blew the whistle once more, louder this time. This time it was not mice, but three strong mountain goats with horns like iron who bounded into the cave and broke down the iron door with one crash. The lad climbed on the largest goat, and it carried him swiftly down the dangerous mountain paths, away from the dwarf's clutches. He did not go straight home, but travelled instead towards the neighbouring King's city, thinking perhaps that King should know of the wicked dwarf in the mountains nearby. He reached the city gates and asked to see the King, saying he was the lad who had silenced the weeds and had news of danger in the mountains. The King heard this and called him in at once, and the beautiful princess, his daughter, sat beside him on her own small throne. The simple son told his tale of the dwarf, the capture, the impossible task, the whistle, the mice, the goats, and the escape, warning the King of the dwarf's wickedness and his great stolen treasure. The King was much impressed by the tale and grateful for the warning, and he said, "Brave lad, you shall stay here as my chief counsellor, and take this bag of gold for your trouble!" The princess too looked kindly upon the simple son, thinking him not so simple after all, but clever and brave.
The King then resolved to capture the wicked dwarf and claim his treasure, and he gathered his bravest knights to make an expedition to the mountain cave. The simple son offered to guide them, for only he knew the secret paths up the mountain and perhaps some of the dwarf's tricks. When they arrived near the cave, they found the entrance blocked by a field of bright red flowers whose scent was so heavy it drew them irresistibly towards sleep. The knights began to yawn mightily, but the simple son remembered the whistle and blew upon it sharply three times, wondering what help might come now. Instantly, three huge eagles swooped down from the peaks, beat their great wings fiercely, and the mighty wind they made blew away the heavy scent, clearing the knights' heads. The knights then rushed into the cave and seized the dwarf easily, before he could rub his eyes clear or cast another spell. The neighbouring King declared the dwarf's fate: he was to be taken back and planted headfirst in the poor man's field, right beside the mighty apple he had coveted, to see how well *he* grew. So they did, and the dwarf's legs turned to wood and took root, and his head grew leaves, and ever after he stood there as a stunted tree growing tiny, sour apples no one could eat. The King gave the simple son all the dwarf's reclaimed treasure as his third reward, saying he had earned it well by his cleverness and courage. Then the King, seeing his daughter looked upon the lad with favour, offered him the princess herself for his wife as the fourth and final reward, which the simple son gladly accepted, and the Princess was well pleased, for she knew a good heart and clever mind were better than any riches.
