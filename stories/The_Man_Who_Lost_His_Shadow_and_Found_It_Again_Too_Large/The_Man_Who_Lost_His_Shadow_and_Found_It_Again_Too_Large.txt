The Man Who Lost His Shadow and Found It Again Too Large
Chapter 1
Once there was a very small man who wished to be very tall. So he stood on a stool all day, but he was still small. Then he heard of an old woman in the woods who could grant wishes. He set off at once to find this old woman. The woods were dark and deep, and a little bird sang sweetly from a branch. The small man paid no heed to the bird and hurried on. At last he came to a crooked little hut, and smoke curled from its chimney. An old woman with a hooked nose and a wart on her chin stood in the doorway. "Good mother," cried he, "I wish to be very tall!" The old woman cackled and said, "That can be arranged, if you are willing to shrink your shadow to pay for it."
Chapter 2
"Anything!" said the small man, "So long as I become tall!" So the old woman took a long, rusty needle and pricked his shadow where it lay upon the ground. At once the shadow seemed to shrivel and grow faint, and the man began to grow taller. He grew taller and taller, until his head brushed the ceiling of the little hut. The man laughed with delight at his new stature. "You had best go outside now," said the old woman, "before you knock my roof off." So the tall man stepped out carefully into the sunlight and saw that his shadow was indeed tiny and pale. "But what matter a shadow," he thought, "when I am so grandly tall?" He walked back towards the village with long strides, often bumping his head on low branches. When he reached the edge of the village, the first people he met cried out in fear and ran away from him.
Chapter 3
The tall man did not understand why they fled. He called out to them, but his voice was now so deep and booming like thunder that they only shrieked louder. Soon, other villagers came running with pitchforks and scythes. The tall man, seeing they meant to harm him, turned and fled back towards the woods. His great strides were clumsy, and he trampled a farmer's fence and squashed a chicken coop as he ran. He hid himself in a thicket, but his legs stuck out because he was so very tall. "Alas," he thought, "this is not what I wanted at all." Just then, a lean wolf, drawn by the commotion or perhaps the scent of his fear, crept towards the thicket. The wolf saw the man's legs sticking out and thought, "A strange, long meal, but a meal nonetheless." The wolf sprang forward and bit deeply into one of the man's ankles.
Chapter 4
The tall man cried out in pain and struggled to stand on his injured leg. As he thrashed about, he knocked over a tall pine tree, which fell and crushed the wolf flat. The tall man stared in amazement at the dead wolf and then at his bleeding ankle. "Alas," he thought, "my height brings me nothing but trouble and bleeding feet." Limping badly, he made his way deeper into the woods, for he dared not return to the village. He lived on berries that were now hard to reach from so high up, and his sleeping was uncomfortable for he could find no place long enough. His only companions were the creatures of the forest, and even they kept a safe distance from his great, clumsy form. Many months passed in this way, and the tall man grew very weary of his life. One day, he remembered the old woman and the strange matter of his shrunken shadow. "Perhaps," he thought, "if my shadow is restored, I will shrink back to my old self."
Chapter 5
So the tall man set off once more through the dark and deep woods, limping still on his sore ankle. Again, the little bird sang from a branch, but this time the tall man stopped to listen. The bird chirped, "Shadow lost, true self crossed; seek the root, to bear new fruit." The tall man did not fully understand the words, but he pondered them as he walked on. After much toil, he stood once more before the crooked little hut. The old woman was there, sitting on a small stool and stirring a pot over the fire. "Good mother," he said, his voice no longer booming but cracked with weariness, "I have learned my lesson; take back this height and give me back my shadow!" The old woman looked at him with her sharp eyes and said, "To shrink is harder than to grow, for it means letting go. You must water the shriveled root of your old self with three drops of your own heart's blood." The tall man felt a chill, for this sounded far more dire than losing a faint shadow. But then he remembered his lonely days and aching ankle, and said, "I will do it."
Chapter 6
The old woman nodded and gave him a wicked-looking thorn, telling him to find the shriveled root of his old self beneath the oldest oak in the woods. The tall man searched for three days and three nights, his ankle throbbing with every step. At last, he found the oldest oak, gnarled and bare, and at its base was a pitiful, dry root barely clinging to the earth. With a trembling hand, the tall man took the thorn and pricked his chest over his heart, and one dark drop of blood fell onto the root. The root seemed to twitch, and the man felt a faint tug downwards, as if he had shrunk a tiny bit. He took a deep breath and pricked himself again, and a second dark drop of blood fell. This time the root pulsed faintly, and he shrank noticeably, and his pale shadow on the ground flickered and seemed to writhe where it lay. His hand wavered before delivering the third prick, for the shadow's strange dance unsettled him. But the thought of his tall misery drove him on, and he pricked his chest a third time, and the third dark drop fell. The shriveled root instantly swelled and turned green, he shrank rapidly back to his original small size, but his shadow on the ground leapt up, no longer pale but black as pitch, and twice as tall as he himself had ever been even at his tallest.
Chapter 7
"You sought to diminish me, little man," the monstrous Shadow rasped, its voice like dry leaves skittering, "Now I shall teach you what it means to be truly small." The small man stood rooted to the spot with terror, his earlier miseries forgotten. The great black Shadow reached down with a hand that was more like a claw and picked him up by the scruff of his neck as one might pick up a kitten. "For too long I have followed at your heels, a pale imitation," the Shadow hissed, "Now you shall follow where I lead, and be the echo." With that, the Shadow began to stride away from the oldest oak, the small man dangling helplessly from its grasp. The Shadow moved with an eerie swiftness, making no sound as it passed through the trees, and it headed back towards the village. "I have no substance of my own to cast a proper shadow, little man," it whispered, its voice cold as the grave, "But you do, your body, your life. And through you, I shall have mine, and more." The small man then understood the true horror of his bargain: he was to be a vessel for this dark thing born of his folly. As they reached the village, the great Shadow was invisible to others, yet wherever the small man was carried, a cold dread fell upon the villagers. Milk curdled in its pails as they passed, tools broke in craftsmen's hands, and children wept without knowing why.
Chapter 8
The Shadow carried the man to the house of the richest farmer in the village. The stout farmer, who feared no man, felt a sudden chill grip his heart as the small man was brought to his door, though he saw only the small man himself. "Farmer," said the small man, his voice now thin and reedy but carrying an unnatural authority, "you will give me all your stored grain and your fattest pig." The farmer, filled with a dread he could not name, knew not why he obeyed such a small man, but he ordered his servants to do as was asked. "And then," added the small man, a cruel smile playing on his lips that was not his own, "you will cut off the pig's ears and tail yourself, and nail them above your door for all to see my tribute." The farmer, white with terror, did this vile thing, his hands shaking as he hammered the bloody parts to his own house. The Shadow seemed pleased by this, and dragged the small man away towards the mill. The miller was a dusty fellow, strong of arm and not easily frightened by tales or shadows. But when the small man, carried by the unseen Shadow, demanded three sacks of his finest flour, the miller who had first scoffed felt a wave of icy despair wash over him and he too complied. "And for my amusement," croaked the voice that seemed to come from the small man, "you will take your own mill cat, sew its eyes shut with mill-thread, and make it turn the grindstone for a day in place of the ass."
Chapter 9
The miller, with tears streaming down his floury cheeks, did this terrible thing too, and the cat’s yowls were dreadful to hear. The small man, though he said and did these things at the Shadow’s bidding, felt his own heart was like a stone of ice within him. Now, the old woman from the woods had come to the village, none knew how or when, and she was watching all that transpired with her sharp eyes. She walked right up to where the great Shadow held the small man. "A fine figure you cut in the world, Shadow," said the old woman, her voice surprisingly strong, "but it is a borrowed coat you wear, and a borrowed voice you use." The great Shadow whirled around with a sound like tearing silk, and its unseen face seemed to fix upon the old woman. "The rusty needle that pricked your first form can also unmake this one," the old woman stated, "but only if the man whose life you stole has the will to reclaim what was his from the start." Hearing this, a tiny spark ignited in the small man's cold heart, and he looked towards the old woman with a desperate plea in his eyes. The Shadow let out a furious howl that was no human sound and lunged, not at the old woman, but to crush the small man in its grasp completely. But quick as a striking adder, the old woman thrust her sooty cooking pot into the path of the lunging Shadow-hand.
Chapter 10
The Shadow-hand passed right through the pot as if it were air, yet where it touched the soot and grime, that part of the Shadow momentarily grew thick and blacker still, and it recoiled with a hiss. "Now, little man!" cried the old woman, thrusting the wicked-looking thorn (which was indeed the rusty needle) back into his hand, "While it remembers substance! Prick your own thumb, and with your blood upon the point, strike where its heart should be!" The small man, his terror now a cold fire of resolve, pricked his thumb hard with the needle, and a bright red drop welled up. He touched the needle-point to his bloodied thumb and then, with all his might, lunged upwards and stabbed the great black Shadow in the chest, where a heart might beat in a true man. A silent scream seemed to tear through the air, though no sound was heard, and the monstrous Shadow began to unravel like smoke in a high wind, or like ink dropped in water, thrashing wildly as it came apart. As it thinned and vanished, the cold dread lifted from the village; milk in pails grew sweet again, broken tools were suddenly whole, and children stopped weeping and began to laugh. The small man stood there, himself again, and saw his own shadow stretch out before him, just the right size and color for a man of his stature. The old woman nodded once more. "A man's shadow is part of him, neither too small nor too large," she said. "To deny it or twist it is to make a monster of oneself, or for oneself." "Indeed," said the small man, looking at his proper shadow with deep relief, "I wish for nothing more than to be myself, just as I am." And so the small man returned to the village, where the people no longer feared him but greeted him as a neighbour, and the old woman was gone as if she had never been.
