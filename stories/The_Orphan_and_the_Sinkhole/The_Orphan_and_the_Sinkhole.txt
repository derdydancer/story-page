The Orphan and the Sinkhole
There was once an orphan who dwelt in a poor hut, and one morning he found a sinkhole had opened beneath his straw bed whilst he slept. Alas, the hole had swallowed his only pair of shoes, which he kept under the bed for fear of thieves. The orphan fetched dirt from outside and poured it into the sinkhole all day, but it remained just as deep as before. By the morrow, the hole had grown wider, so that the orphan could scarce stand in his hut without fear of falling in. So he left the hut, for the floor was naught but hole, and went into the world to seek his fortune, though he still had no shoes.
He walked until he came to a mill beside a river, where a stout miller was grinding corn. "Have you any work for a poor orphan?" asked the boy, but the miller squinted at his bare feet and said, "What work can shoeless feet do but track mud? Be off with ye!" Yet, no sooner had the miller spoken than the ground beneath his own feet gave a lurch, just like the floor of the hut, and he tumbled backwards into a sack of flour. The miller sat up, covered head to foot in white flour, looking like a doughy ghost, and the orphan stared. "Hold," sputtered the miller, brushing flour from his eyes, "perhaps there is work after all; sweep the mill floor clean, and you shall have a crust of bread."
So the orphan took the broom and swept diligently from dawn till dusk, clearing away the chaff and spilled flour. But as he gathered the sweepings into a pile, a small hole appeared in the floorboards beneath it, just like the one in his hut, and swallowed the dust down. The orphan quickly swept more flour over the spot, hoping the miller would not notice the new hole amongst the old boards. That night, however, the hole grew wider still, and in the morning the miller’s prize pig, which slept near the back door, had vanished into it entirely. When the miller found the great hole and his pig gone, he roared, "This is witchcraft! Trouble follows you, boy! Be gone from my mill before the river itself is swallowed!"
So the orphan left the mill, with only the crust of bread in his hand, and knew not whither to go. As he sat weeping by the roadside, a tall man with a neat pointed beard, who smelled faintly of sulphur, stopped before him and said, "You seem troubled, boy; perhaps I can help?" The orphan, seeing no other hope, told him of the hole that followed him, and the lost shoes, and the miller's swallowed pig. The tall man chuckled, "Ah, that hole! A little bit of mischief, dug it myself one night when I was bored and somewhat annoyed by your snoring through the thin hut walls." "But," he added, stroking his beard, "I can close it up for you neat and tidy, in exchange for just one small service you shall do for me when you are grown."
The orphan, shoeless and hungry, saw no other way forward and agreed at once, for what else could he do? The Devil smiled, stamped his foot thrice upon the ground, and the earth sealed up solid as rock where the orphan sat, leaving no trace of any hole. And what is more, at his feet appeared his old shoes, now wondrously mended and sturdy. Then, with a wink and a quiet little pop, the tall man vanished. Now that he had shoes and no hole followed him, the orphan found work easily with a farmer in the next valley, where he tended the sheep and mended fences.
Years passed, and the orphan grew into a youth, and because he worked hard and honestly, the farmer favoured him above all his other servants. But the strangest thing was happening back at the spot where his hut once stood; the ground, sealed by the Devil, grew vegetables of prodigious size, with pumpkins as big as wine-casks and beanstalks that seemed to reach the clouds. Word of these marvels reached the King of that land, who loved novelty, and he commanded that the largest pumpkin be brought to his court. It took twenty men with ropes and levers to roll the pumpkin onto a cart, and even then they moved it only with the greatest difficulty. The King was delighted with the giant pumpkin, but then he gazed thoughtfully towards the distant beanstalks and declared, "What of the beans? Fetch me a pod from the very top!"
But the beanstalk was so tall it was lost in the clouds, and no man in the kingdom could climb it. Just then, as the youth was mending a fence near the edge of the farmer’s land, the tall man with the pointed beard appeared beside him once more, saying, "Well met, youth; you are grown now, and I have need of that service you promised." "The King desires a bean pod from yonder stalk," the Devil continued, pointing to the enormous plant shimmering in the distance, "You shall climb it and fetch one for me." "But how?" cried the youth, "It reaches the clouds; no man can climb it!" "For you, it will be easy," sneered the Devil, producing a pair of greasy black gloves and boots, "Put these on; they stick like fly-paper to any surface."
The youth put on the sticky gloves and boots, and found he could walk straight up the beanstalk as easily as walking on level ground, and so he climbed swiftly until he was above the clouds. He stepped off onto a wide land made of clouds, where nothing grew save for the very top of the beanstalk itself, which bore one single bean pod the size of a small boat. With great effort, the youth plucked the pod from the stalk; it was heavy as stone and bumped awkwardly against his legs. As he turned to climb down, a voice like gentle thunder murmured from the endless blue above, "Hmm, beans don't usually grow up here; bit untidy." The youth paid the voice no mind and climbed down the stalk just as easily as he had climbed up, dragging the enormous pod behind him.
He reached the bottom and gave the pod to the Devil, who rubbed his hands together and said, "Excellent, excellent! Just what I wanted." "It makes a wonderful back-scratcher for those hard-to-reach spots," the Devil explained with a grin, and disappeared again in his usual quiet pop. The youth, feeling somewhat foolish but also relieved, decided he might as well take the giant pumpkin, which still sat upon its cart, to the King himself. He arrived at court, dragging the cart with surprising ease (perhaps the Devil's magic lingered), and the King was impressed, asking, "How did you manage this alone when twenty of my men could barely budge it?" The youth bowed low and said, "Your Majesty, I found it is mostly hollow inside; I simply pushed out the seeds and rolled it quite easily then."
The King laughed, delighted by such simple ingenuity, and gave the youth a purse full of gold and a place among his lesser advisors. Now, the King had a daughter who was very beautiful, and she watched all this from her window and was much intrigued by the clever youth. But soon a new trouble arose, for the giant vegetables left in the field began to rot, and gave off such a terrible stink that it spread through the whole land. "Rid me of this stench!" commanded the King, pinching his nose, but no one knew how to clear away mountains of rotting pumpkin and beans. The youth, who was now a royal advisor, heard this and thought the matter over carefully for a day and a night.
Then he went to the crossroads outside the city at midnight and called out for the tall man with the pointed beard. The Devil materialized before him with a faint smell of sulphur and decay, asking, "What now, clever boy? Did you miss my help?" The youth described the great stink from the rotting growth that the Devil's magic had caused, and asked, "Can you not remove this foulness?" The Devil stroked his beard thoughtfully, "Perhaps I can, but cleaning up is tedious work; I shall require half of whatever reward the King gives you for this service." The youth, eager to solve the problem and win more favour, agreed to this new bargain.
Thereupon the Devil waved his hand, muttered a word that sounded like 'Begone!', and in an instant all the rotting plants vanished from the fields, and the terrible stink disappeared from the air. The youth returned to the King, bowed, and announced that the air was fresh again as he had commanded. The King was overjoyed and granted the youth great lands and the title of Lord Advisor to the Crown. True to his word, the youth took half the value of the lands in gold, went to the crossroads that night, and left the heavy bag there unseen, feeling a shiver despite his new lordship. The beautiful princess watched him receive his new honours, and grew fonder of the clever Lord Advisor each day.
But one feast day, as the court celebrated, the ground trembled violently, and a great sinkhole, just like the first one only far larger, opened directly beneath the King's palace, threatening to swallow it whole. Panic seized the court, and the King, in terror, proclaimed that whoever could close this abyss would have his daughter's hand in marriage and half the kingdom besides. The youth knew only one power that might close such a hole, but he feared the price; yet, seeing the princess's pale face, he resolved what must be done and went once more to the crossroads at midnight. When the Devil appeared, the youth did not plead but declared boldly, "Your hole-digging has become unstable! This giant abyss beneath the palace is clearly your shoddy work, and frankly, it makes you look quite foolish."
The Devil spluttered, greatly insulted, "Shoddy work? Foolish? I'll show you shoddy!" and he stamped his foot so hard the earth shook, thundered a word that cracked the very air, and the great sinkhole sealed itself shut forever. The youth returned to the safe palace, reminded the King of his promise, and the King, true to his word, announced the wedding. And so the youth, who was once a poor orphan with no shoes, married the beautiful princess. But it is said that where the Devil stamped his foot so fiercely at the crossroads, a tiny spring bubbled up, and to this day it splashes muddy water on his neat boots whenever he passes by, which annoys him exceedingly. The youth ruled his half of the kingdom wisely for many years, always ensuring the palace foundations were sound. And he and the princess lived happily together to the end of their days.
