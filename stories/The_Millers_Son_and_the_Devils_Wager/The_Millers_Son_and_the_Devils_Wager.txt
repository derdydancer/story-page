The Miller's Son and the Devil's Wager
There was once a miller who had a son, but this son was not like other youths. His father, a good-natured but rather dim-witted miller, mostly sighed and gave him another piece of bread. Before that, the youth had spent his days lounging by the millpond, trying to teach the frogs to sing in chorus. His stepmother, a woman so sour she could curdle milk with a glance, had finally declared there was not enough bread in the house for a lazy lout like him. So he had taken his small bundle and set off into the wide world to seek his fortune, or at least a good meal. He had arrived at the king's city, a poor wanderer with naught but the clothes on his back. His first task, to count all the bees in the royal hive without being stung once, he had accomplished by asking the queen bee politely. The second task given by the king was to fetch three golden apples from the enchanted orchard beyond the wailing mountains. He had made the surly, three-headed dog that guarded the golden apples laugh so hard that all its heads fell off, quite harmlessly. For his bravery and cleverness in the enchanted orchard, the king had promised him a chance to win the princess's hand.
The king had sent him on this perilous final task, saying, 'If God wills it, you shall return victorious.' The youth had just returned from the crossroads where he had bested the Devil in a game of wits, though he knew not the full stakes. The youth stood before the king and the princess, his trials nearly complete. Suddenly, with a clap of thunder and a stench of brimstone, a terrible fiend appeared in the throne room. The fiend had seized the princess and was about to devour her, when the youth charged forth. With a final, mighty blow, the youth clove the monstrous fiend from crown to crotch. Before them lay the sundered remains of the great beast, its black blood smoking on the castle stones. The Devil himself appeared then, chuckling, and said, 'Hark ye, the king and I had a wager on that fiend, which was but one of my lesser spirits, sent to test your mettle, and I confess, your butchery was most amusing!' Then the king embraced the youth, and said, 'You are a true hero, and worthy of my daughter's hand!' And so the youth married the princess, and they lived in great joy and splendor ever after.
