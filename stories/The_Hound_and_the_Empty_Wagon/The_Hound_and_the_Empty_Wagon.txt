The Hound and the Empty Wagon
There was once a king, old and gaunt, who ruled a small kingdom. At his heels always followed his faithful hound. The king did not feast nor hunt, but sat each day by his high window, looking down upon the road. The hound lay patiently on the cool stones nearby. Then it happened one day, and every day after at noon, that a great black wagon, quite empty, rolled up the road to the castle gate. No driver held the reins, and no horses pulled it, yet it stopped silently before the gate. It waited there for one hour by the sun, and then rolled away again down the road. The old king watched this from his window and said nothing. The hound beside him growled low in his throat each time the wagon came. This went on for many weeks.
At last, the king called his court together and said, 'You see the wagon that comes each day. What can it mean?' But the men of the court looked at each other and shook their heads, for no man could say, and they were afraid. 'Then go forth,' said the king, 'you bravest knights among you, and follow this wagon. Find out whence it comes and why.' Three knights, the bravest in the land, rode out the next day on their strongest horses, with their sharpest swords at their sides. They waited by the gate when the black wagon rolled away after its hour was done. Then they spurred their horses after it, but though they rode like the wind, they could not keep it in sight for long. Soon the wagon vanished where the road turned into a dark wood, and they found themselves alone and did not know the way. They came back at evening to the king with empty hands and heavy hearts. The king heard their tale and said naught, but only stroked his hound's head. And the black wagon came each day as before, empty and silent.
Then one morning, the king looked at his hound and said low, 'Good dog, you must follow the wagon today.' The hound wagged his tail once, and licked his master's hand, as if he understood. So when the wagon rolled away that noon, the faithful hound trotted silently after it, keeping it ever in sight. Unlike the knights' horses, the hound's silent paws made good speed, and being low to the ground, perhaps it did not lose the track so easily. It followed it still when the road turned into the dark wood where the knights had lost their way. The hound went on and on, deep into the wood, until the sun began to lower in the sky. At last the wagon stopped beside a small hut with a thin chimney from which grey smoke was rising. And as the hound watched, the great black wagon vanished into thin air. The hound sat down under a tree and watched the hut. Presently, an old woman came to the door of the hut.
She saw the hound and said, 'Well now, watchful one, have you come at last?' The hound wagged his tail, for her voice was kind, and he did not growl. 'Come inside,' the woman said, 'and rest your paws. Your journey was long.' The hound followed her into the small, clean hut. Inside was only a table, a chair, and a hearth where a small fire burned, but she gave him fresh water in a bowl and a crust of dark bread. The hound ate the bread and drank the water. 'The wagon you followed,' said the old woman, stirring the fire, 'comes each day to fetch me.' 'My time is almost come,' she sighed, not sadly, 'and soon I must ride in it.' 'But first,' she said, looking at the hound kindly, 'you must return to your master and tell him what you have learned.' The hound rose to his feet and licked her hand again, ready to obey.
He turned and trotted back out of the hut and into the woods, the way he had come. It was a long way, and night fell while he was still deep in the forest, but the stars came out. He came upon three foolish goblins dancing in a ring around a toadstool. 'Ho there, dog!' they cried. 'Lost are you? Far from home tonight!' The hound paid them no mind, but only cocked his leg briefly against their toadstool and trotted on. The goblins sputtered and shook their fists, but they did not follow. He travelled all night, and at dawn, he came to the edge of the woods and saw the castle lights ahead. Weary, the hound trotted up to the castle gate just as the morning sun touched the highest tower; his feet were sore. The old king was already at his window, watching, and he came down and opened the gate himself. The hound whined softly and licked his hand, and looked up at the king as if telling his tale.
'I see,' said the old king after a moment. 'You found her, the keeper of the wagon. And her time comes.' 'So the wagon is but a chariot for the end of a journey,' the king murmured. 'Perhaps one day it will come thus for me also.' The hound pressed close against his legs and laid his head upon the king's knee, as if understanding his master's thought. Life in the castle went on, and the wagon came each noon, but now there was no longer fear, but a quiet waiting in the air. The old king began to walk more among his people, to listen to their troubles and give what comfort he could. He kept the hound ever closer, and often shared his own meals with him upon the floor. Now, the king's cook grew jealous of the favor shown to a mere dog. One day, this cook stole the king's softest slipper from beside the bed and hid it well. But the hound sniffed about the room, and soon found the slipper under a loose floorboard, bringing it proudly to the king. The King laughed, sent the foolish cook away, and gave the hound a velvet cushion to lie upon beside his own chair.
So the seasons turned, many times, and the king grew older still, and his steps became slow. The faithful hound grew old also; his muzzle turned grey, and he slept more. Then one noon, the black wagon came as always, but it seemed different; the dark wood shone faintly white. And this time, it was not empty, for the old woman from the forest hut sat within it, wrapped in a grey shawl. She looked up at the king's high window and nodded once, gravely. The king rose slowly from his chair by the window and bowed his head. Then the wagon rolled away down the road, with the old woman inside, and did not vanish this time but went on out of sight. 'My own time draws near, old friend,' the king said softly to his hound. 'The wagon will come again soon for me, I think.' The old hound laid his grey muzzle on his master's lap and did not leave his side, day or night. Three days later, the wagon came again at noon, shining white like bone in the sun.
The old king sighed once, looking towards the window, then closed his eyes and lay still upon his great chair. The old hound beside him let out a long, low howl. But the white wagon did not come for the king; instead, a tall figure, cloaked and hooded so no face could be seen, stepped down from it. The figure paid no heed to the still king upon the chair, but walked to where the old hound lay. 'Faithful one,' said the figure, its voice like dry leaves rustling, 'It is you I have come for; the empty wagon was to carry the weight of your loyalty, offered day by day.' The old hound looked up at the tall figure, and did not snarl, but wagged his tail faintly, once. 'You understand the journey then,' the figure said, and gestured towards the waiting white wagon. The hound rose stiffly on his old legs, walked into the white wagon, and lay down. The cloaked figure stepped back, the wagon door closed silently, and it rolled away from the castle for the last time. And the white wagon, and the figure, and the faithful hound, were never seen in that kingdom again.
But the hound opened his eyes in a place of soft light, where there was no sun nor moon. He felt no stiffness in his old legs, and his muzzle was no longer grey. Before him stood a Man with exceedingly kind eyes and a voice like gentle thunder. 'Welcome, faithful one,' said the Man. 'Your loyalty shone brighter than many a man's deeds.' 'It is not the way of things for your kind to enter here,' the Man continued, 'but your great heart and unwavering loyalty have earned you this place.' 'You shall rest here at my feet for eternity,' declared the Man. The hound lay down upon the soft light, content, with a happy sigh. And he rests there still, the faithful hound, at his new Master's feet. Back in the kingdom, the people mourned the old king, and wondered greatly what became of his faithful hound. But they never truly knew the secret of the empty wagon, nor the high reward granted to loyalty.
The old woman from the forest hut, it is said, reached her own rest peacefully. The jealous cook, sent away by the king, eventually opened a small, greasy inn by the roadside, though customers were few. The three brave knights returned to their duties, and never knew how close they came to the wagon's secret. A new king ruled in the land, and there were more feasts and hunts than before. But the faithful hound rests still in the place of soft light. Loyalty, it seems, is a precious thing indeed. He sleeps soundly now, after his long watch. And if he has not ceased resting, he rests there still. So the tale ends. Thus it was.
