var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "Establishes the King's character as weary and perhaps ill, setting a somber tone and introducing the theme of mortality early on.

Describes his state simply using age ('old') and physical condition ('gaunt'). Simple sentence structure. Adheres to guide.", "Moral Implication": "Introduces the theme that even kings are subject to time and decay. Sets a contemplative mood.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The King represents the ruling conscious principle (Ego), but here it is depicted as aged and weary, suggesting a psyche confronting its limitations, perhaps facing the end of a life cycle or burdened by experience (inspired by Antonius Block).", "Sentence": "There was once a king, old and gaunt, who ruled a small kingdom.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces the main character, the hound, establishing its key trait: loyalty, and its constant proximity to the King.", "Grimm Style": "Introduces an animal character, common in Grimm. Focuses on its defining action/trait (followed his master) and location (at his heels). Simple description ('faithful hound').", "Moral Implication": "Highlights the virtue of loyalty, embodied by the hound. Establishes the bond between king and animal.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Hound represents instinct, loyalty, perhaps the intuitive self or the 'animal soul' closely connected to the weary Ego (King). Its faithfulness suggests that instinct remains true even when the conscious mind weakens.", "Sentence": "At his heels always followed his faithful hound.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the King's routine, emphasizing his detachment from typical royal duties (feasts, hunts) and reinforcing his contemplative or weary nature. He seeks observation over action.", "Grimm Style": "Simple description of repeated action ('each day'). Contrasts expected royal behavior (feasts, hunts) with his chosen passivity (sitting by the window). Focuses on external action.", "Moral Implication": "Suggests a departure from worldly engagement. What does the King seek by watching the road?", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (King) withdraws from active engagement with the outer world (feasts, hunts) and turns towards passive observation, perhaps introspection or waiting for something. The window is a threshold between inner and outer worlds; the road represents the path of life or fate.", "Sentence": "The king did not feast nor hunt, but sat each day by his high window, looking down upon the road.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "The hound mirrors the King's inactivity, emphasizing their connection and shared state. It waits with him.", "Grimm Style": "Simple sentence describing the hound's action (or inaction). Reinforces its loyalty and connection to the King's state. 'Lay patiently' describes its posture simply.", "Moral Implication": "Patience and shared endurance. The hound reflects its master's mood.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Instinct (Hound) mirrors the state of the Ego (King), lying dormant or patiently waiting while the conscious mind observes or contemplates. It remains present and connected, even in stillness.", "Sentence": "The hound lay patiently on the cool stones nearby.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 4}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces the central mystery: the arrival of the empty wagon. Establishes its regularity ('every day at noon') and key features ('great,' 'black,' 'empty').", "Grimm Style": "Introduces the core conflict/mystery matter-of-factly. Simple description using functional adjectives ('great,' 'black,' 'empty'). Precise timing ('at noon') adds to the ritualistic feel. Follows the 'Do' list for setting/events.", "Moral Implication": "A strange, unexplained event disrupts the ordinary. Emptiness suggests mystery, lack, or perhaps potential.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The arrival of the wagon represents a recurring, mysterious intrusion into the conscious realm (kingdom). Its timing ('noon' - height of consciousness) makes it unavoidable. Black suggests the unknown, shadow, or death. Emptiness is key: it could symbolize lack, a vessel waiting to be filled, or the void. It's the central symbol the weary Ego (King) must confront.", "Sentence": "Then it happened one day, and every day after at noon, that a great black wagon, quite empty, rolled up the road to the castle gate.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the wagon's driverless nature, adding to its mystery and supernatural quality. Its silent stop emphasizes its uncanny presence.", "Grimm Style": "Adds specific detail reinforcing the mystery ('no driver,' 'no horses'). Describes its action simply ('stopped silently'). Enhances the uncanny atmosphere without complex language.", "Moral Implication": "The event defies natural explanation. Silence and lack of visible agency increase the sense of unease.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The wagon operates autonomously, without visible conscious control (no driver/horses). This suggests it originates from a deeper, perhaps archetypal or impersonal, level beyond the Ego's understanding. Its silence represents the non-verbal, potentially numinous or threatening, nature of this manifestation.", "Sentence": "No driver held the reins, and no horses pulled it, yet it stopped silently before the gate.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 6}, {"Plot Function": "The wagon waits for a specific duration, then departs as mysteriously as it arrived. Establishes its consistent, ritualistic behavior.", "Grimm Style": "Describes the duration ('for one hour') and departure simply ('rolled away again'). Reinforces the repetitive, unexplained nature of the event.", "Moral Implication": "The event has a set pattern, a ritualistic quality. Its purpose remains obscure.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The manifestation persists for a set time ('one hour') within the conscious threshold (gate) before receding. This regular, timed appearance suggests a persistent psychological process or a recurring summons from the unconscious that demands attention but doesn't force interaction.", "Sentence": "It waited there for one hour by the sun, and then rolled away again down the road.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 7}, {"Plot Function": "Shows the King's reaction: silent observation. He doesn't act or speak initially, merely watches the phenomenon.", "Grimm Style": "Focuses on the King's external action ('watched') and lack of action ('said nothing'). Conveys his contemplative or perhaps perplexed state without describing internal feelings.", "Moral Implication": "Initial reaction is passive observation, not immediate action. Perhaps caution, fear, or deep thought.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The weary Ego (King) observes the recurring mystery passively, without immediate interpretation or action. This reflects a state of contemplation, or perhaps the Ego feeling powerless or unsure how to respond to this persistent unknown.", "Sentence": "The old king watched this from his window and said nothing.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 8}, {"Plot Function": "Shows the hound's reaction: a low growl, indicating alertness and suspicion or dislike of the uncanny wagon. This contrasts with the King's silence.", "Grimm Style": "Describes the animal's reaction simply ('growled low'). Provides a sensory detail ('in his throat'). Contrasts with the King's passivity. Gives the hound agency/reaction.", "Moral Implication": "Instinct reacts with suspicion to the unnatural event. The animal senses something wrong or threatening.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Instinct (Hound) reacts viscerally to the uncanny manifestation (wagon) with a warning sign (growl). This contrasts with the Ego's passive observation, suggesting that the instinctual level perceives the phenomenon as potentially dangerous or disruptive.", "Sentence": "The hound beside him growled low in his throat each time the wagon came.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 9}, {"Plot Function": "Establishes that this pattern continued for a significant time, becoming a strange fixture of life at the castle, setting the stage for rising tension or action.", "Grimm Style": "Uses a simple time phrase ('This went on for many weeks'). Summarizes the continuation of the mysterious event. Builds the sense of an enduring, unresolved situation.", "Moral Implication": "Life continues even around unexplained mysteries. How long can this go on before something changes?", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The mysterious phenomenon becomes a chronic feature of the psychic landscape ('went on for many weeks'). The Ego (King) and Instinct (Hound) continue their pattern of observation and reaction, but the underlying issue remains unresolved, suggesting a growing pressure for confrontation or understanding.", "Sentence": "This went on for many weeks.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 10}, {"Plot Function": "The King finally breaks his silence and addresses his court, acknowledging the mystery and seeking counsel or action. This moves the plot forward.", "Grimm Style": "Shows the King taking action ('called his court'). Uses simple direct speech to state the problem ('You see the wagon'). Poses a question seeking explanation ('What can it mean?').", "Moral Implication": "Observation leads to questioning. Rulers must eventually address persistent anomalies. Seeking wisdom from others.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (King) finally moves from passive observation to active inquiry, engaging the broader conscious functions (court). It acknowledges the mystery ('You see the wagon') and seeks understanding ('What can it mean?'), initiating a conscious attempt to grapple with the unknown.", "Sentence": "At last, the king called his court together and said, 'You see the wagon that comes each day. What can it mean?'", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 11}, {"Plot Function": "Shows the court's reaction: fear and ignorance. They have no answers, only apprehension, highlighting the unique and unsettling nature of the wagon.", "Grimm Style": "Describes the collective reaction simply ('looked at each other,' 'shook their heads'). States their lack of knowledge ('no man could say') and emotional state directly ('they were afraid').", "Moral Implication": "Collective wisdom fails before the truly unknown. Fear is a common reaction to the inexplicable.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The collective conscious functions (court) are unable to provide an explanation for the mysterious manifestation (wagon). Their fear and ignorance highlight the limits of conventional understanding when faced with something emerging from beyond the known (potentially the unconscious or supernatural).", "Sentence": "But the men of the court looked at each other and shook their heads, for no man could say, and they were afraid.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 12}, {"Plot Function": "The King issues a command for investigation, tasking his bravest knights with discovering the wagon's origin or purpose. This represents the first active attempt to solve the mystery.", "Grimm Style": "King gives a direct order ('Go forth,' 'find out'). Specifies the agents ('bravest knights') and the task. Simple, action-oriented command structure.", "Moral Implication": "Action is required to dispel mystery. Bravery is called upon to face the unknown.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (King) dispatches its most courageous conscious resources ('bravest knights' - perhaps aspects of willpower, defense mechanisms, or focused inquiry) to actively investigate the mysterious manifestation (wagon). This is the Ego trying to exert control and understanding through its strongest agents.", "Sentence": "'Then go forth,' said the king, 'you bravest knights among you, and follow this wagon. Find out whence it comes and why.'", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 13}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the knights' attempt to follow the wagon. They are determined and well-equipped.", "Grimm Style": "Simple description of action ('rode out'). Specifies their number ('Three knights'). Emphasizes their readiness ('strongest horses,' 'sharpest swords'). Follows Rule of Three.", "Moral Implication": "A serious attempt is made, using the best available resources.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Three represents a complete effort. The conscious resources ('knights') are mobilized with their best energy ('horses') and tools of discernment/defense ('swords') to pursue the mystery.", "Sentence": "Three knights, the bravest in the land, rode out the next day on their strongest horses, with their sharpest swords at their sides.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 14}, {"Plot Function": "The knights wait for the wagon's departure, ready to begin their pursuit.", "Grimm Style": "Simple action ('waited by the gate'). Sets the scene for the pursuit. Builds slight tension.", "Moral Implication": "Patience required before action. Readiness for the task.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The conscious forces wait at the threshold (gate) for the manifestation (wagon) to begin its return journey, preparing to follow it back to its source.", "Sentence": "They waited by the gate when the black wagon rolled away after its hour was done.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 15}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the failure of the pursuit. Despite their speed, the knights cannot keep up; the wagon mysteriously outpaces them.", "Grimm Style": "Direct statement of failure. Emphasizes the wagon's unnatural speed ('though they rode like the wind,' 'could not keep it in sight'). Highlights the supernatural element.", "Moral Implication": "Conventional strength and speed are insufficient against this mystery. The wagon operates by different rules.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Conscious effort ('knights riding like the wind'), even at its peak, cannot follow the mysterious manifestation (wagon) back to its source. It retreats too quickly or operates on a different plane, suggesting the limits of conscious pursuit into the depths or origins of such phenomena.", "Sentence": "Then they spurred their horses after it, but though they rode like the wind, they could not keep it in sight for long.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 16}, {"Plot Function": "The wagon vanishes completely, leaving the knights lost and unsuccessful.", "Grimm Style": "Simple description of the outcome ('wagon vanished'). States the knights' condition ('found themselves alone,' 'did not know the way'). Clear failure.", "Moral Implication": "The mystery deepens; it actively eludes pursuit. Those who try may become lost.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The mysterious phenomenon disappears from conscious tracking ('vanished'). The pursuing conscious functions ('knights') are left disoriented ('alone,' 'did not know the way') when they lose sight of it, indicating that such pursuits can lead to psychic disorientation if unsuccessful.", "Sentence": "Soon the wagon vanished where the road turned into a dark wood, and they found themselves alone and did not know the way.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 17}, {"Plot Function": "The knights return defeated, reporting their failure to the King.", "Grimm Style": "Simple statement of return ('came back at evening') and outcome ('with empty hands and heavy hearts' - slightly more descriptive than usual, but uses stock pairing). Reports failure directly.", "Moral Implication": "Even the bravest can fail against the inexplicable. Disappointment and failure acknowledged.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The conscious forces return unsuccessful ('empty hands') and disheartened ('heavy hearts').
