The Farmer and the Traveler's Rest
There was once a wealthy farmer in a certain land who worked his fields, but not as others did. For where others sowed wheat or barley, he spent many hours piling up great mounds of earth. His neighbours shook their heads when they passed by, but said naught. In his house dwelt only a sly cat and an owl that could neither see nor hear. The cat would sit on the fence posts and watch the farmer work, blinking slowly, as if it understood. The owl sat in the rafters and mostly slept, though sometimes it fell down. One evening, as the sun began to set, the farmer stopped his digging. Then a traveler came down the road and stopped by the gate. He was weary, and had no horse nor any bag upon his back. The traveler looked at the farmer and asked for a place to rest his bones for the night.
The farmer nodded, his face showing neither surprise nor suspicion, and said, 'You are welcome.' So the traveler followed the farmer into the house. They sat by the hearth, and the farmer shared his plain meal of bread and cheese and water. Neither the farmer nor the traveler spoke any words during the meal. Only the sly cat watched from the shadows, and its green eyes never left the traveler. Then the owl fell from its rafter perch with a soft thud, knocking over an empty clay pot. The traveler did not flinch, and the farmer paid it no mind, as if it happened often. When the meal was done, the farmer showed the traveler a pile of clean straw in the corner. The traveler lay down upon the straw and said nothing. Soon the farmer went to his own bed, and the house was still.
When morning came, the farmer rose early as was his way. He found the traveler already sitting up on the straw, watching the door. The farmer went out without a word and began again to pile earth upon his mounds. After some time, the traveler rose from the straw, went out into the field, and stood watching the farmer. At last the traveler spoke, his voice rough like stones grinding. 'Why do you build these mounds instead of tilling your fertile fields?' The farmer stopped his work and looked at the traveler, saying only, 'A man must build what he must build.' The traveler nodded slowly. 'Then I will help you build,' he said. 'But first we must find the stones that sleep in the western wood.' 'Very well,' said the farmer, laying down his shovel. Behind a bush nearby, a fox with a lame foreleg watched them both. And so the farmer and the traveler set off together towards the western wood.
They walked for some time along a winding path into the wood. The sly cat followed far behind, keeping to the shadows of the trees. Meanwhile, back at the farmhouse, the blind owl tried to perch on the window ledge, missed, and knocked the latch off the chicken coop door. The coop door swung open, and all the farmer's chickens fluttered out into the yard. The lame fox, who had lingered near the farm, saw the chickens scattering. It limped swiftly across the yard and caught one plump hen. At last the farmer and the traveler reached a quiet part of the wood where sunlight barely touched the ground. 'Now,' said the traveler, 'close your eyes and listen for the stones that wish to wake.' The farmer closed his eyes tight and listened hard. He heard nothing for a long time but the sighing of the wind in the high branches.
Then at last, he heard a faint humming sound seemingly coming from the earth under his feet. 'I hear one,' the farmer whispered, pointing to a spot covered in moss. 'Dig there,' the traveler commanded. The farmer dug with his bare hands and soon uncovered a smooth, dark stone, strangely warm to the touch. 'That is one,' the traveler said. 'We need three such stones before the moon rises.' So the farmer listened again, and dug again, and found two more warm, dark stones nearby. The stones were heavy; each one the farmer could barely lift. As the farmer struggled with the third stone, the sly cat darted out from the trees, rubbed against his legs, and purred loudly. The farmer, startled, loosened his grip, and the third stone fell back to the earth with a thud. The traveler did not frown but said, 'Leave it. Two will be enough for tonight.'
So the farmer and the traveler turned back towards the farm, each carrying one of the heavy stones. It was slow work, and the stones seemed heavier with every step. The sly cat watched them for a while, then slipped away silently into the undergrowth. Back at the farm, as dusk fell, the scattered chickens went back into their coop one by one. The blind owl fluttered down again and bumped the coop door, and it swung shut with a click. The lame fox returned later for another meal, but found the door shut fast. Late that night, weary and sore, the farmer and the traveler reached the farmhouse with their heavy burden. They placed the two dark stones carefully upon the largest mound of earth. 'That is enough for now,' the traveler said. And that night, both the farmer and the traveler slept deeply until the sun was high.
For many days after that, the farmer worked his mounds, and the traveler rested or watched. The farmer saw that the two dark stones sank slowly into the earth of the mound, until only the tops could be seen. 'It is time,' the traveler said one morning. 'Now you must fetch water from the well where the moon sleeps.' 'And where might that well be?' asked the farmer. 'Follow the blind owl when it next takes flight at noon,' the traveler replied. 'It flies true without eyes.' Though this seemed a strange path indeed, the farmer agreed. At noon the next day, the farmer stood waiting in the yard with an empty bucket. Presently, the blind owl stirred in the rafters and then flew out of the barn, straight towards the sunrise. The farmer shielded his eyes and followed the bird's flight as best he could. From the roof of the house, the sly cat watched him go until he was out of sight.
All day the farmer walked, for the owl flew slowly and sometimes zigzagged for no reason. As night began to fall, the owl at last settled on the branch of a dead tree. The farmer came up, weary from his walk, and found an old stone well at the foot of the tree. The water within was dark and still, but in its centre the reflection of a full moon shone brightly, though no moon was in the sky. The farmer lowered his bucket carefully into the water. As he drew it up, he felt a strange weight resisting him. He pulled harder, and the bucket came up, but inside was not water, but the traveler himself, dripping and pale. 'You have drawn me out,' the traveler gasped, clutching the side of the well. The farmer stared, then reached down and helped him climb out onto the grass. 'It was not the water you were meant to fetch,' the traveler said, shivering, 'but me.'
He seemed smaller now, and less mysterious than before. 'Then what is the third task?' the farmer asked after a moment. 'You must take me home,' the traveler replied. 'You must place me inside the oldest mound you have built.' 'There I can finally rest, and my journey will be ended.' The farmer understood this was a task unlike the others, but he agreed. He lifted the traveler, who was now surprisingly light as a bundle of dried leaves, and began the long walk home. This time, the blind owl flew silently overhead all the way. When they reached the farm, the sly cat sat waiting on the oldest mound. The farmer dug an opening in the side of the oldest mound and gently placed the traveler inside. The traveler sighed once, a sound like wind through dry grass, and then seemed to melt into the dark earth of the mound.
The farmer closed the opening with earth. He felt a faint warmth coming from the mound, and noticed the grass around it grew greener. He sat down upon another mound and looked at his work, then at his own hands. Then he stood up and went to fetch his shovel, not to build, but perhaps to till a small patch of ground nearby. The sly cat curled up on the warm mound where the traveler rested, and purred. The lame fox stayed near the farm after that, but did not trouble the chickens again. The blind owl slept in the rafters. And the farmer lived for many years, and worked his mounds, and no one troubled him further. Wildflowers of many colours grew upon the mounds each spring. And perhaps the farmer works there still.
