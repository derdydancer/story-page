The Sideways Kingdom and the Mirrored Helmet
There was once a queen in a certain kingdom, who being left a widow, made a decree that none of her subjects should look straight ahead or upwards, but must keep their gaze ever down, or backwards, or to the side. Now, in this kingdom dwelt a miller who had three sons, and the youngest was held by all to be rather simple. And so that this decree might be strictly obeyed, the queen commanded that every man, woman, and child should wear blinkers upon their heads, making them walk sideways like crabs, or backwards like fools, and many bumped into walls. Furthermore, the queen declared that any found looking ahead or upwards should, on pain of her displeasure, have their nose cut off. One day, the miller's youngest son dropped his only copper coin, and search as he might, turning his head this way and that, he could not look down properly past his blinkers to find it in the dust. As he scrabbled blindly, a very old woman sitting by the roadside watched him with eyes that seemed to look everywhere at once. She chuckled, a sound like dry leaves skittering, and said, "Foolish boy, sometimes you must look hard at what's behind your own heels to see what lies before your own nose." The miller's son thought this strange, yet seeing a muddy puddle nearby, he turned his back to where the coin might be, bent low, and saw its reflection clear in the water, grabbing it swiftly. He pocketed the coin, pleased with himself, but unbeknownst to him, from a high castle window, another pair of eyes had noted his strange backward-bending discovery. These eyes belonged to the king's daughter, who seldom looked down as decreed, but often sideways from her window, and she watched the miller's son depart.
The next day, the princess contrived to walk in the castle courtyard, and let fall her silken kerchief near where the miller's son was sweeping, calling out, "Good youth, pray retrieve my kerchief, but mind the queen's law!" The miller's son, remembering the puddle, quickly kicked the kerchief sideways with his foot until it bounced off a wall and landed near his hand, all while keeping his gaze averted downwards, and he presented it to her with a sideways bow. The princess smiled at his trick, and later spoke idly to her maids of the old tale of a magic helmet, set all over with mirrors, that allowed the wearer to see every which way, and how such a thing might solve the kingdom's troubles. That very week, the queen, whose prize falcon had flown off and nested atop the highest palace spire, decreed that whosoever could tell her the color of its eggs without looking up, should have a sack of gold. Hearing this, the miller's son thought of the princess's tale, and resolved that he must seek this mirrored helmet, for only thus could the falcon's eggs be seen lawfully. He knew not where such a thing might be found, so he went back to the roadside where the old woman sometimes sat, turning his head this way and that until he spied her. In his haste, looking sideways for her, he tripped over a sleeping pig, landed nose-first in its trough, and came up sputtering, much to the amusement of the creature. Shaking the slop from his blinkers, he finally reached the old woman, who was indeed looking directly at the pig and laughing heartily. When he asked about the helmet, she wiped her eyes and said, "Such things are not found by looking down at dust nor sideways at pigs, but are sometimes reflected in the eye of the Devil himself, if you dare look backwards into his deals." She told him the Devil kept court in a cave beyond the Whispering Marshes, a place few returned from, especially those wearing blinkers.
So the miller's son thanked her, hitched up his blinkers firmly, and set out towards the Whispering Marshes, travelling for three days through dismal lands. At last he found the cave, dark and smoky, and within sat a figure in fine clothes, idly polishing a boot buckle, who looked sideways at him and chuckled, "Well, well, a blinkered fly stumbles into my parlor!" "They call me the Master of this domain," the figure said, his voice smooth as oil, "and I hear tell you seek a certain mirrored trifle I possess; perhaps we can make an arrangement, blinkers." The miller's son, keeping his gaze fixed firmly on the polished boot buckle to avoid looking up or ahead, replied, "Good Master, I seek only what is lost, and would earn it fairly if a task be set." The Devil laughed. "Fairly? Very well. See this heap of mixed seeds – poppy, mustard, and rye? Sort them into three perfect piles by sunrise, using only your feet and keeping your blinkered gaze strictly sideways or down." The miller's son, despairing at first, then remembered his reflection trick; he found a small pool of spilled wine on the cave floor, turned his back to where the coin might be, bent low, and by looking down into the wine's dark surface, guided his feet sideways to nudge the tiny seeds into three distinct heaps based on their reflected shapes. When the Devil returned at dawn, he scowled mightily at the three neat piles, kicked one slightly, and muttered, "Reflections! Bah! A promise is a promise, even for the blinkered." He tossed a dusty, strangely shaped helmet towards the youth, saying, "Take your mirrored bauble then, but know this: seeing all ways at once can show you things you'd rather not see, sideways-boy." The miller's son snatched up the helmet; it was made of a dull grey metal, but cunningly set all around its brim and crown were dozens of tiny, polished mirrors angled outwards. He carefully put it on his head, adjusting his blinkers over it, and marvelled as the tiny mirrors showed him the cave roof above, the path ahead, the Devil scowling behind him, and his own feet below, all at the same instant.
With a sideways nod to the scowling Devil, the miller's son left the cave and began his journey back towards the queen's city, the helmet feeling heavy but useful upon his head. Along the way, he saw two bakers bump squarely into each other, sending loaves flying, and a farmer trying to lead his cow backwards out of a ditch, all because they dared not look ahead. Seeing a child's doll about to be trodden on in the road ahead, the youth used the helmet's reflection to accurately kick a stone sideways, which startled the approaching carter just enough that he swerved, saving the toy. The child's mother, looking back, thanked the heavens for their luck, never guessing the sideways-glancing miller's son nearby had intervened. He reached the palace gates just as the town crier was again announcing the queen's challenge regarding the falcon eggs atop the spire. The miller's son went straight to the guard captain, his blinkers firmly in place and the mirrored helmet hidden beneath his tunic, and declared he would answer the queen's query. Brought before the queen upon her throne, she looked down her nose at him and commanded sharply, "Speak then, miller's son, tell us the color of the falcon's eggs high above, but mark well my law concerning your gaze!" The youth bowed low, his head near the polished marble floor; adjusting his tunic slightly, he gazed intently downwards, reading the reflection of the spire high above in the tiny mirrors near his collar, and declared clearly, "Your Majesty, the three eggs are speckled blue." A great gasp went through the court, for this was indeed the truth, and the queen stared hard at the youth, her eyes narrowed in thought though she could not fault his downward gaze. "The gold is yours as promised," the queen announced, gesturing for a heavy sack to be brought, "but tread carefully, miller's son, for those who seem too clever often trip over laws sideways."
The miller's son took his sack of gold, which made his father and brothers cease calling him simple, yet still the people of the kingdom stumbled about in their blinkers, complaining of bruised shins and lost directions. Then a great shadow fell over the land, for a hungry Griffin began to circle the skies, swooping down unpredictably to snatch sheep and sometimes even children, though none could track its flight by looking only down or sideways. The queen grew pale with fear and proclaimed that whosoever could drive away the Griffin without once looking upwards would receive the Royal Oxen Farm and all its herds. Many knights and heroes tried, shooting arrows backwards over their shoulders or sideways into the clouds, mostly hitting pigeons or their own feet, much to the Griffin's amusement. The miller's son saw this folly and knew only the mirrored helmet offered a chance, so he fetched it from beneath his pallet where it lay hidden. He went to the highest hill, and by watching the Griffin's flight reflected in his helmet's mirrors, he timed his sideways throws perfectly, launching sharp rocks that struck the beast under its wing, where it was vulnerable. With a screech of pain and surprise, the Griffin flew off crookedly towards the horizon, and was never seen in that kingdom again. Though most rejoiced blindly, the princess, watching sideways from her tower, had seen the strange glinting from the miller's son's head as he threw, and saw how his throws matched the unseen beast's path. He was cheered as the kingdom's savior, but the queen summoned him immediately, her face a mixture of gratitude and sharp suspicion. "The Royal Oxen Farm is yours," she declared, "but tell me truly, youth, how does one fight a sky-beast while studying one's own boots? Speak, or my next decree may concern more than noses!"
The miller's son, now a wealthy farmer, tried to manage his herds sideways, which led to many cows wandering off, while the queen praised his downward gaze yet pondered his impossible victories. But the Devil, still vexed at being outwitted for the helmet, decided it was time the sideways-glancing kingdom came a cropper, and schemed a fine mischief. He caused a great chasm to open silently in the main road during the night, knowing the blinkered royal procession, due to pass sideways that morning, would surely blunder straight into it. Just as the queen's carriage was about to tumble sideways into the pit, the miller's son, seeing the danger ahead in his helmet, instinctively shouted "Stop! Look ahead!", and was immediately seized by the guards for treasonously uttering forbidden words and gazing forward. As the queen prepared to pronounce sentence – the loss of his nose and perhaps his head – the princess stepped forward, crying, "Mother, wait! This youth saved us! I saw strange mirror-flashes from his head before, and his shout, though unlawful, prevented disaster!" Encouraged by the princess, the miller's son knew his hiding was over; he pulled the helmet from his tunic and lifted it high for all to see. "Your Majesty," he declared, holding the helmet so its mirrors reflected the court, the chasm, and the sky all at once, "this allows sight without forbidden looking! It helped me see the eggs, fight the Griffin, and spy this pit! Your decree blinds us to danger!" At that moment, a single beam of sunlight broke through the clouds, striking the mirrored helmet so it blazed with light, and a gentle voice seemed to echo from the sky, "Indeed, true sight is no sin." The queen, momentarily blinded by the light and hearing the voice, looked truly ahead for the first time in years, saw the waiting chasm, and shuddered at her folly. "Enough!" she cried, "Let the decree be unmade, and these cursed blinkers burnt! And for showing us the truth, brave youth, you shall have the Royal Treasury's third coffer!"
A great cheer went up as people tore off their blinkers, blinking in the full light of day, looking up and ahead with delight, and the miller's son was hailed as the cleverest hero in the land, owner of gold, farms, and treasure. As for the Devil, who had watched the reversal from afar, he found himself suddenly afflicted with a pair of blinkers he could not remove, doomed forever to only see the ground crumbling beneath his own heels. The queen, now seeing clearly, smiled upon the miller's son, deeming him not only clever and brave but wise beyond measure. "One reward remains," she announced to the happy court, "for the man who saved my daughter, saved my kingdom, and saved me from my own foolishness: the hand of the princess herself!" The miller's son, who had looked sideways at the princess with admiration many times, bowed (looking ahead now) and accepted with great joy. The princess laughed gladly and declared, "I knew from his clever sideways kick he was no ordinary sweeper; I accept him with all my heart!" So great preparations were made throughout the land for a wedding feast the likes of which had not been seen in years. The wedding feast lasted seven days, and all the guests looked wherever they pleased, remarking how much brighter the tapestries seemed when viewed straight on. The miller's son, now a prince, helped the queen rule wisely, his mirrored helmet kept polished on a stand as a reminder of past follies and strange sights. And they all lived long and happily in the kingdom where everyone could finally look up at the sun, down at their toes, or straight ahead at whatever lay before them.
