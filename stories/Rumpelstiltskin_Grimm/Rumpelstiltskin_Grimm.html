var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "Attribution and Genre Setting. This sentence identifies the story's origin and sets the expectation for a fairy tale collected by the Brothers Grimm, implying a certain style, structure, and thematic content.", "Grimm Style": "External to the narrative itself, this is a factual statement. If analyzed as if it were part of a Grimm-style text, it is simple, declarative, and provides essential identifying information concisely.", "Moral Implication": "Indirectly signals the moral landscape typical of Grimm's tales: often stark distinctions between good and evil, with clear consequences for actions, and underlying folk wisdom.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Establishes the story as part of a collection rooted in folklore, suggesting it taps into archetypal themes and narratives from the collective unconscious. The 'Brothers Grimm' themselves become symbolic of the preservation and transmission of these deep-seated cultural stories.", "Sentence": "A fairy tale by the Brothers Grimm", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "Introduction of initial characters and setting. Establishes the miller's poverty and the daughter's key attribute (beauty), common starting points in fairy tales that often lead to extraordinary events. Poverty provides motivation for the miller's later boast.", "Grimm Style": "Classic fairy tale opening reminiscent of 'Once upon a time.' Simple vocabulary ('miller,' 'poor,' 'beautiful daughter'). Compound sentence structure linked by 'but.' Direct and unadorned, focusing on essential information. The adjective 'beautiful' is a common, functional descriptor.", "Moral Implication": "Sets a backdrop of humility and lack. The daughter's beauty, an unearned attribute, will become a focal point, highlighting how external qualities can lead to both opportunity and peril. The father's poverty might implicitly justify his later desperation or ambition.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'poor miller' signifies humble origins, a connection to the common folk, or an initial state of lack/undevelopment. The 'beautiful daughter' can represent innate but unrecognized potential, the Anima figure, or purity that is about to be tested. Her journey will involve confronting existential threats triggered by her father's actions and her perceived value.", "Sentence": "There was once a miller who was poor, but he had one beautiful daughter.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Inciting Incident. The miller's boast to the king sets the entire plot in motion. His desire for 'consequence' (status, importance) leads him to make an extraordinary and false claim about his daughter's abilities.", "Grimm Style": "Simple narrative progression ('It happened one day'). The miller's motivation ('to give himself consequence') is stated directly. The magical claim ('spin gold out of straw') is introduced matter-of-factly, a typical feature of how extraordinary elements are presented. Compound sentence structure.", "Moral Implication": "Illustrates the dangers of pride and deceit. The miller's lie, born from insecurity and a desire for status, places his daughter in mortal danger. This highlights a moral that falsehoods have serious repercussions. It also shows how ambition can override parental responsibility.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The miller's boast represents an inflation of the Ego, a desire to appear more significant than one is. 'Spinning gold out of straw' is a metaphor for creating immense value from nothing, a magical act of transformation. The king represents a powerful authority figure (Superego or societal demand) to whom the miller projects this inflated claim. The daughter becomes the unwilling vessel for this impossible expectation.", "Sentence": "It happened one day that he came to speak with the king, and, to give himself consequence, he told him that he had a daughter who could spin gold out of straw.", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "The King's Reaction and Challenge. The king takes the miller's boast at face value and immediately sets a trial for the daughter, introducing the element of threat and the stakes (testing the claim).", "Grimm Style": "Direct speech from the king ('That is an art that pleases me well...'). Use of archaic 'thy'. The king's dialogue is authoritative and sets a clear command and condition. Simple sentence structure within the dialogue. The phrase 'put her to the proof' is a common stock expression.", "Moral Implication": "Demonstrates the king's eagerness (later revealed as avarice) and his power to command. It reinforces the consequence of the miller's lie, as the claim is immediately tested. It also shows a ruler who values an 'art' for its material benefit rather than any intrinsic quality.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The king, as an authority figure, embodies a challenge or a demand for proof of asserted value. His pleasure in the 'art' of gold-spinning points to a materialistic worldview. The 'castle' is a place of power and testing. The daughter is summoned to validate a projected fantasy, a common fairy tale motif where the protagonist must live up to an impossible external expectation.", "Sentence": "The king said to the miller: \"That is an art that pleases me well; if thy daughter is as clever as you say, bring her to my castle to-morrow, that I may put her to the proof.\"", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 4}, {"Plot Function": "Setting the Impossible Task and Threat. The daughter is imprisoned with straw and given the ultimatum: spin it into gold or die. This establishes the central conflict for the first part of the story and the extreme peril she faces.", "Grimm Style": "Direct action and dialogue. The description of the room ('quite full of straw') is simple and functional. The king's command is blunt ('Now set to work...') and the threat is stark ('thou shalt die'). The use of 'wheel and spindle' grounds the magical task in ordinary tools. Active voice dominates.", "Moral Implication": "Highlights the cruelty and absolute power of the king, and the terrifying consequences of the miller's lie for his daughter. It underscores the vulnerability of the innocent protagonist when faced with overwhelming authority and impossible demands. The life-or-death stake emphasizes the desperation of her situation.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The room full of straw represents a seemingly insurmountable task, an overwhelming amount of raw, unrefined material (psychologically, undifferentiated unconscious content or overwhelming problems). The 'wheel and spindle' are tools of transformation, but she lacks the 'magic' (skill, knowledge, inner resource) to use them for this purpose. The death threat signifies existential crisis. She is forced into a situation where ordinary means are insufficient.", "Sentence": "When the girl was brought to him, he led her into a room that was quite full of straw, and gave her a wheel and spindle, and said: \"Now set to work, and if by the early morning thou hast not spun this straw to gold thou shalt die.\"", "Chapter Number": 5, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "Isolation of the Protagonist. The king personally ensures her confinement, emphasizing her helplessness and the lack of any immediate escape or external aid.", "Grimm Style": "Simple, declarative sentence. Focuses on a direct action ('shut the door himself') and its consequence ('left her there alone'). The detail 'himself' subtly underscores the king's direct involvement and control.", "Moral Implication": "Emphasizes the protagonist's complete isolation and vulnerability. There is no appeal or mercy from the king. This highlights the harshness of the world she has been thrust into.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Being 'shut in' and 'left alone' symbolizes an inward turn, a confrontation with the self and its limitations when faced with an overwhelming challenge. This isolation is often a necessary precursor to the appearance of help from the unconscious (the little man) or the activation of hidden potentials.", "Sentence": "And he shut the door himself, and left her there alone.", "Chapter Number": 6, "Sentence Number": 6}, {"Plot Function": "Protagonist's Despair.

This line, as part of the couplet/quatrain structure, is typical of magical pronouncements or significant cries in Grimm tales.", "Moral Implication": "Part of the little man's undoing through his own carelessness and hubris. He reveals his actions and, eventually, his name out of sheer glee.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The domestic actions ('bake', 'brew') can symbolize creative or transformative processes occurring in the unconscious. His gleeful anticipation of acquiring the child is expressed through these everyday activities, making his supernatural nature seem momentarily grounded, yet also highlighting his otherworldly confidence.", "Sentence": "\"Today do I bake,", "Chapter Number": 31, "Sentence Number": 33}, {"Plot Function": "Rumpelstiltskin's Song (Line 2). Continues his chant, pairing 'brew' with 'bake,' further domesticating his image while building anticipation for his prize.", "Grimm Style": "Continues the AABB rhyme scheme typical of such verses. 'Brew' complements 'bake,' suggesting preparation and transformation (of ingredients).", "Moral Implication": "Reinforces his fatal self-exposure through boastful song. He is so caught up in his anticipated triumph that he becomes careless.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Baking and brewing are alchemical metaphors for transformation. He is preparing for the acquisition of the 'queen's child,' a highly valued 'product' of his bargain. This highlights the creative/destructive duality of this unconscious figure.", "Sentence": "tomorrow I brew,", "Chapter Number": 32, "Sentence Number": 34}, {"Plot Function": "Rumpelstiltskin's Song (Line 3). States his anticipation of receiving the queen's child, the object of his bargain.", "Grimm Style": "Direct statement of his goal within the song. The timing 'The day after that' completes his short-term plan. This line is crucial for confirming his identity to the listening messenger as the one involved with the queen.", "Moral Implication": "His open declaration of intent underscores his confidence and lack of awareness that he is being overheard, contributing to his downfall.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'queen's child comes in' signifies the claiming of the vital psychic energy or potential that was bargained away. His anticipation shows the drive of this unconscious complex to achieve its aim.", "Sentence": "The day after that the queen's child comes in;", "Chapter Number": 33, "Sentence Number": 35}, {"Plot Function": "Rumpelstiltskin's Song (Line 4). Expresses his gladness that his identity is secret, ironically just as it is being discovered.", "Grimm Style": "This line is highly ironic given the context of the messenger overhearing him. It builds dramatic tension as the audience (and messenger) now know his secret is out.", "Moral Implication": "The height of his hubris and carelessness. His belief in his anonymity is precisely what is being shattered. This is a classic example of pride coming before a fall.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The joy in anonymity ('nobody knew') reflects the power that unconscious complexes derive from remaining hidden or unrecognized by the conscious Ego. Once named (brought to light), their power is often diminished.", "Sentence": "And oh! I am glad that nobody knew", "Chapter Number": 34, "Sentence Number": 36}, {"Plot Function": "Rumpelstiltskin's Song (Line 5 - Climax of Song).

This is the critical piece of information the queen needs. The exclamation mark emphasizes his glee.", "Moral Implication": "The ultimate act of self-betrayal through arrogance. His own words provide the weapon against him. This is a strong moral about the dangers of excessive pride and loose tongues, even for magical beings.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The speaking of the 'true name' is a potent act. Here, the unconscious complex names itself, providing the conscious Ego (via the messenger to the queen) with the very key to neutralizing its power. 'Rumpelstiltskin' itself is a strange, unique name, befitting a peculiar, powerful, and hidden entity.", "Sentence": "That the name I am called is Rumpelstiltskin!\"", "Chapter Number": 35, "Sentence Number": 37}, {"Plot Function": "Queen's Reaction and Final Confrontation Setup. The queen's pleasure at learning the name is immense. She then strategically delays revealing it when the little man arrives, heightening the suspense.", "Grimm Style": "The narrator's direct address ('You cannot think how pleased...') emphasizes the queen's relief. Her playful, delaying tactics with common names ('Jack,' 'Harry') build suspense before the final reveal. This is a common storytelling device. The dash separates the little man's final incorrect guess from his answer.", "Moral Implication": "The queen now has the power but uses it strategically. Her initial feigned ignorance contrasts with her inner knowledge, showing her newfound confidence and control over the situation. It's a moment of reversal where she, not the little man, dictates the pace.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The queen's pleasure signifies the Ego's empowerment through acquiring hidden knowledge. Her toying with the 'little man' by guessing wrong names first can be seen as the Ego testing its newfound power or savoring the moment of triumph over a previously overwhelming unconscious force. She is no longer a passive victim but an active player.", "Sentence": "You cannot think how pleased the queen was to hear that name, and soon afterwards, when the little man walked in and said: \"Now, Mrs. Queen, what is my name?\" she said at first \"Are you called Jack?\"", "Chapter Number": 36, "Sentence Number": 38}, {"Plot Function": "Rumpelstiltskin's denial of the common name 'Jack'.", "Grimm Style": "Simple, direct denial in dialogue. This continues the queen's strategic delay and builds suspense.", "Moral Implication": "Reinforces that the name is unique and not easily guessed. Each denial from him unknowingly leads him closer to his defeat.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The incorrect guesses are dismissed, emphasizing that the true 'name' (essence) of the unconscious complex is specific and cannot be equated with generic labels. The power lies in the exact identification.", "Sentence": "- \"No,\" answered he.", "Chapter Number": 36, "Sentence Number": 39}, {"Plot Function": "Queen's Second Incorrect Guess. She offers another common name, 'Harry,' continuing her suspenseful delay.", "Grimm Style": "Simple dialogue. The repetition of the guessing pattern maintains the tension before the climax.", "Moral Implication": "Further demonstrates the queen's control of the situation, drawing out the confrontation before revealing her knowledge.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Another common label is tried and will be found wanting. The queen is ensuring the moment is right, or perhaps confirming that only the true name has power.", "Sentence": "\"Are you called Harry?\" she asked again.", "Chapter Number": 37, "Sentence Number": 40}, {"Plot Function": "Rumpelstiltskin's second denial.", "Grimm Style": "Brief, direct dialogue. His consistent denial of common names underscores the uniqueness of his true name.", "Moral Implication": "His continued ignorance of the queen's knowledge builds the dramatic irony leading to his downfall.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The dismissal of another generic name reiterates that the specific, hidden identity of the complex is key. Each 'no' brings him closer to the revelation that will undo him.", "Sentence": "\"No,\" answered he.", "Chapter Number": 38, "Sentence Number": 41}, {"Plot Function": "The Climactic Reveal. The queen finally utters the correct name, 'Rumpelstiltskin,' solving the riddle and winning the challenge.", "Grimm Style": "The queen's phrasing ('Then perhaps your name is Rumpelstiltskin?') is slightly tentative, which can be seen as a final touch of suspense or feigned uncertainty. This is the moment of triumph.", "Moral Implication": "Knowledge is power. By discovering and speaking his true name, the queen breaks his power over her and saves her child. This highlights the importance of uncovering hidden truths.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The speaking of the true name 'Rumpelstiltskin' signifies the conscious Ego successfully identifying and integrating (or gaining power over) a potent unconscious complex. This act of naming brings the hidden into the light, thereby transforming its influence.

Upon hearing his name, he reacts with fury, attributes the revelation to demonic intervention, and destroys himself in a fit of rage. This resolves the conflict and eliminates the threat permanently.", "Grimm Style": "Highly dramatic and violent ending for the antagonist. His exclamation ('The devil told you that!') is a common folk expression of utter shock and disbelief at an impossible revelation. His self-destruction is described graphically but briefly ('stamped... went into the ground... seized his left foot... split in two'). The concluding phrase 'and there was an end of him' is a typical Grimm formula for a definitive end.", "Moral Implication": "The ultimate consequence of his hubris and the power of the revealed truth. His rage consumes him. It's a stark depiction of evil destroying itself when its true nature is exposed. It also suggests that some forces, once understood or named, lose their coherence or power.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The little man's furious reaction and self-destruction upon being named symbolizes how a psychic complex or shadow element can lose its power\ufffdor even 'destroy' itself as an autonomous force\ufffdonce it is fully brought into consciousness and its true nature is understood. His blaming 'the devil' is an attempt to externalize the source of his undoing, failing to recognize his own carelessness. His bizarre self-destruction (stamping his foot so deep, then tearing himself apart) is a concretization of an entity shattering under the force of revelation.", "Sentence": "\"The devil told you that! the devil told you that!\" cried the little man, and in his anger he stamped with his right foot so hard that it went into the ground above his knee; then he seized his left foot with both his hands in such a fury that he split in two, and there was an end of him.", "Chapter Number": 40, "Sentence Number": 43}];
