The Silent Monk and the Tear of God (Full)
There was once a monk who dwelt in a quiet monastery, and though he could speak quite well when alone, he uttered no word when any other soul was near.
In his small cell, his only companion was a talking donkey, which had been schooled by Jesuits and spoke with great learning.
Each day the monk performed his duties in silence, while the donkey often quoted learned fathers of the Church or commented on the quality of the hay.
One morning, alas, a sacred relic known as the Tear of God, a single drop of crystal kept within the monastery chapel, was found to be missing.
The Abbot tore at his hair and wept, and he commanded all monks to search every corner of the holy grounds, but the Tear was nowhere to be found.
Then the Abbot, looking upon the silent monk, pointed to him and then towards the wide world outside the monastery gates, making it clear that he, despite his affliction, must seek the lost Tear.
The Jesuit donkey then brayed loudly, "And I shall go with him, for who else will speak for you and read the maps, good father Abbot?" and thus it was settled.
So, with the Abbot's blessing, but with little food and no money, the monk upon the donkey's back rode out from the monastery into the wide world.
After some days, they came to the edge of a dark forest, where the trees grew so thick that the sun dared not to penetrate its gloom.
“Hark ye, brother monk,” said the donkey, “the old texts speak of such forests as places where lost souls wander and where the very air is sorrowful; let us be wary.”
The monk, without a word, merely nudged the donkey’s flanks with his heels, and so they entered the shadowed wood.
Dry twigs snapped under the donkey’s hooves, and the only other sounds were the cries of unseen birds and a distant rustling in the undergrowth.
“Brother,” began the donkey, clearing its throat, “have you ever considered the precise nature of an angel’s locomotion? Is it by volition, or by a continuous act of divine sustentation?”
The monk only patted the donkey’s neck and pointed further down the barely visible path, his gaze fixed ahead.
Soon they came upon a small, withered wreath of flowers lying on a mossy stone, as if left there long ago and forgotten.
“Ah,” sighed the donkey, “like the garland of forsaken Dido, perchance, a testament to love’s sharp ache; a heavy subject, indeed.”
The monk dismounted, picked up the wreath, touched it to his brow, and then gently laid it back upon the stone.
As they continued, a low moaning sound reached their ears, a sound not of beast nor man, yet full of a deep and abiding pain.
The donkey’s ears flattened against its skull and its sturdy legs trembled, but the monk simply made the sign of the cross and pressed onward.
They found the source of the sound in a small clearing: a great, magnificent stag with antlers like the branches of an old oak, its leg caught fast in a cruel iron trap.
“By the sainted bones of Ignatius!” cried the donkey, “What manner of godless man would set such an engine of torment for God’s own creatures? This is a grievous sin!”
The monk slid from the donkey’s back and, after a moment’s examination of the trap’s mechanism, began to work with his strong hands to pry open its iron jaws.
The metal was stubborn and the monk strained, the iron creaking in protest, while the great stag rolled its eyes in fear and snorted plumes of white breath.
At last, with a sharp crack, the trap sprang open, and the stag, after looking at the monk for a long moment with its great, dark eyes, bounded away into the trees and was gone.
“Well,” observed the donkey, twitching an ear, “one does not often receive a bow or a ‘thank ye kindly’ from such forest nobility, but the deed itself was good.”
The monk looked down at his hands, and saw they were scraped and bleeding slightly from his struggle with the iron.
Wiping his hands on some moss, the monk remounted the donkey, and they journeyed on as the light began to fail.
When darkness fell completely, they sought shelter at the foot of a broad-branched ancient oak, the largest tree they had yet seen.
“Our oats are scant, brother,” remarked the donkey as the monk shared the last of their bread, “and this forest offers little hospitality for a discerning palate.”
As they settled down, the monk suddenly pointed: through the distant trees, a faint and flickering light, like a single star fallen to earth, could just be seen.
“A hermitage, perhaps?” mused the donkey. “Or some errant will-o’-the-wisp? My studies suggest caution with nocturnal illuminations, yet– curiosity is a powerful spur to scholarship.”
The monk nodded, and together they rose and began to make their way cautiously towards the distant gleam.
The way was difficult, with thorny bushes that tore at the monk’s robe and tangled roots that tripped the donkey, but the light grew steadily brighter.
At last they came to a small clearing, and in its center stood a little hut built of rough logs, with a mossy roof, and the light shone from its single window.
Before the monk could reach the door, it creaked open, and an old woman, bent with age but with eyes as keen as a hawk’s, stepped out holding a flickering candle.
“Hark, travelers,” she said, her voice like the rustling of dry leaves, “what seek ye so late in this benighted wood, where only shadows and sorrows hold court?”
The donkey, bowing its head as much as a donkey can, replied, “Good mother, we are on a holy quest to find the lost Tear of God, stolen from our monastery, and the path has led us hither.”
The old woman looked at the silent monk, and then at the talking donkey, for a long time, her keen eyes seeming to pierce through them to their very souls.
“The Tear of God, ye say?” she finally rasped. “Well, the night is cold and the wood is full of peril; enter my humble dwelling, but you must ask me three questions, and answer one of mine, ere morning light.”
The monk looked at the donkey, who nodded gravely, and so they followed the old woman into the dim, herb-scented interior of the hut.
Inside, bunches of dried herbs hung from the low rafters, strange symbols were painted on the wooden walls, and a single black raven perched on a skull regarded them with one bright eye.
The old woman bid them sit on low stools, and she broke a loaf of dark bread for them and poured a bitter, steaming tea from an earthen pot.
“Revered mother,” said the donkey, after a sip of the brew that made its whiskers twitch, “concerning these questions: are there any particular subjects forbidden, or any preferred mode of inquiry?”
“Ask what you will, so long as your questions are truthful and come from the heart,” the old woman replied, her gaze unsettlingly steady, “for the wind carries away empty words.”
The donkey pondered for a moment, then asked, “Good mother, do you know aught of the Tear of God, the sacred relic we seek, or of who might have taken it?”
The old woman smiled, a slow, knowing smile. “The Tear of God,” she said, “is born from the sorrow of the world, and can only be held by a heart that has forgotten how to weep for others.”
“A weighty thought, indeed,” the donkey conceded, then pressed on, “Our second question, then: is there a path through this accursed forest that does not lead to despair or the dens of ravenous wolves?”
“All paths in any forest are the same, little brother,” she replied, stirring her pot, “fear finds wolves at every shadow, but faith finds hidden springs even amongst barren rocks.”
Then the monk, who had been silent as the stone floor, slowly raised a hand, pointed to his own mouth, then to his heart, and looked at the old woman with an expression of profound inquiry and sorrow.
The old woman’s eyes softened for the first time. “The silent tongue,” she whispered, “is often payment for a broken vow, or for a word that once unleashed innocent blood upon the earth.”
Hearing this, the monk grew so pale that his skin seemed like parchment, and the hand he had raised trembled violently before he slowly lowered it to his lap.
“Heavy truths for a heavy heart,” the old woman murmured, then her keen eyes sharpened again. “Now, your three questions are answered; it is time for mine.”
She leaned forward, her voice dropping low, “Tell me, travelers: if God is all good and all powerful, from whence comes the shadow that dogs every joy, and why does the innocent lamb shiver in the wolf’s gaze?”
The donkey stroked its chin with a hoof, a habit it had, and began a lengthy discourse on free will, the nature of privation as the absence of good, and the possibility of a greater, albeit inscrutable, divine plan.
The old woman listened patiently, but when the donkey paused for breath, she simply shook her head and said, “Words, words, like dry leaves in a winter wind.”
Then she fixed her piercing gaze upon the monk. “And you, silent one? What say you to the wolf, and the lamb, and the shadow that ever follows light?”
The monk looked at her, and then two large tears welled in his eyes and traced paths down his dust-stained cheeks, before he bowed his head low.
A flicker of something unreadable passed through the old woman’s eyes. “Aye,” she said softly, “that is an answer the wolf itself might understand. Ye have answered well.”
“As for your Tear of God,” she continued, “know that it was not stolen by common thief, but taken by one who serves a master of great shadow and ice, who dwells in a fortress atop the highest, most frozen mountain of the North.”
“The master of that fortress is the Devil himself. Go if you must, but know that no mortal blade can touch him, and only a heart already broken can hope to bargain there. Pray to your God, little monk, for you will need more than silence on that peak. Now, dawn breaks; be gone.”
With a swirl of morning mist, the hut was gone, and the raven, and the old woman; the monk and the donkey stood alone in the silent, dew-drenched forest, the rising sun painting the leaves with gold.
“By the Ninety-Five Theses of Wittenberg!” exclaimed the donkey, shaking its head until its ears flopped. “Did we dream it all, brother? The Devil’s fortress? Your broken vow and– and innocent blood? These are matters for an Ecumenical Council, not a simple questing ass!”
The monk looked to the North, where the trees seemed darker and the air colder, then gently urged the donkey forward onto a barely discernible game trail leading that way.
For many days they traveled north, over sharp stones that bruised the donkey’s hooves and through icy streams that chilled the monk to the bone, while a biting wind howled constantly through the barren branches.
The donkey, to pass the time, recited the various torments reserved for each category of sinner as described by Dante, occasionally pausing to ask the monk if he thought a particular punishment was truly fitting for the crime.
The monk never replied to these theological queries, but only stared ahead, his face like a mask carved from old, weathered stone.
One bleak afternoon, they came upon a sight that made even the donkey fall silent: a great grey wolf, crucified upon a rough-hewn cross by the path, its dead eyes staring at the uncaring sky.
“Merciful heavens,” whispered the donkey after a long pause, “is this the justice of these lands, or a warning? A wolf is a wolf, acting by its nature; to punish it so seems– a perversion of order itself.”
The monk, however, dismounted, and with considerable effort, pulled the heavy nails from the creature’s paws and body, laying the dead wolf gently upon the frozen earth.
No sooner had he done so than the air grew colder still, a shadow fell over them though the sun was hidden, and before them stood a tall figure cloaked in black, with eyes like burning coals and a voice like the grinding of glaciers, who said, “Who dares meddle with my judgments and offer pity to the condemned in my domain?”
The Jesuit donkey, for the first time in its articulate life, could only manage a choked, terrified bray, its legs collapsing beneath it as it sank to the ground.
The monk alone remained standing, his gaze steady upon the dark figure, though he offered no word nor sign, save for the slight tightening of his grip upon the simple wooden cross he wore about his neck.
“I know you, little son of the monastery,” the Devil sneered, a plume of sulphurous smoke escaping his lips. “You serve Him who claims all that is bright, and you seek a bauble He supposedly wept.”
“But I am not without a sense of– sport,” the Devil continued, tapping a long, black fingernail against a fang. “You shall have three tasks from me, here in this land of mine. Succeed, and perhaps I shall tell you where your Tear lies. Fail, and your soul, and that of your chattering beast, shall be mine to flay for eternity.”
“For your first task,” the Devil proclaimed, pointing to a barren, craggy mountainside scarred by ancient fires, “you must make that dead mountain weep tears of pure water before the next moonrise – not with magic, but with a sorrow so profound it moves the very stones to pity the innocent blood you yourself once caused to flow.”
The monk looked at the dead mountain, then at the Devil, and then, slowly and deliberately, he bowed his head once, a silent assent to the dreadful terms.
“Excellent,” hissed the Devil, his form beginning to waver like heat above a pyre. “The moon is my witness. Begin when you will.” And then he was gone, leaving only the scent of ash and the profound silence of the frozen land.
The donkey, finally scrambling to its feet, looked from the monk to the dead mountain and back again, its voice a mere croak, “Make a mountain weep? With sorrow? Brother, we are undone! This is a task for God Himself, not a mute monk and a terrified ass!”
But the monk walked slowly to the foot of the dead mountain, knelt upon the cold stones, closed his eyes, and clasped his hands together, his lips moving silently as if in prayer or deep remembrance.
All that day and into the cold night he knelt there, as still as the mountain itself, while the donkey watched from afar, shivering more from dread than from the icy wind that swept down from the peaks.
The stars wheeled overhead in their silent dance, and the first pale light of dawn was beginning to touch the eastern peaks, yet still the monk knelt, unmoving, a figure of stone in the desolate landscape.
Then, as the sun’s first true ray struck the mountain’s highest crag, a sound came from the monk – a single, low sob, like the breaking of a heart that had held its grief for a lifetime.
And then, his voice raspy from disuse but clear in the still air, he spoke to the mountain, “Oh, little sister, lost in the snows of my betrayal, for your innocent life taken by my youthful pride and broken word, for this I have silenced my joy and my tongue these many years!”
Then the monk wept, not with single tears as he had before the old woman, but with great, racking sobs that shook his whole frame, his face buried in his scraped and bleeding hands.
And as he wept for the innocent blood he had caused to flow, a small trickle of water, then another, and another, began to seep from a crevice in the dead rock face high above him on the barren mountain.
The trickles became rivulets, the rivulets became streams, and soon the entire scarred face of the dead mountain was awash with flowing water, as if its stony heart had broken in sympathy with the monk’s anguished soul.
The Jesuit donkey, forgetting all its fear of the previous night, stared with wide eyes and whispered, “Laus Deo! Praise be to God! It is a miracle akin to Moses striking the rock, or the earth trembling at the Crucifixion! Such sorrow, such penitence!”
But the monk seemed not to hear, still lost in his profound grief, the waters from the weeping mountain now mingling with his own tears upon the cold earth.
Just as the pale rim of the moon appeared over the distant, jagged horizon, the Devil materialized once more beside them, his form dark against the newly flowing streams.
He surveyed the weeping mountain, then the still-sobbing monk, and a frown like a thundercloud creased his brow. “So,” he rumbled, the sound like stones grinding together, “the dead rock weeps for your dead sister. You have fulfilled the first task, little monk.”
“But do not think your path is eased,” the Devil spat. “For your second task, you must take these pure waters, now sanctified by a penitent’s tears, and use them to wash the grime from the most notorious den of thieves and murderers in my northern lands, making it clean enough for angels to tread by the next sundown.”
The monk slowly raised his head, his eyes red-rimmed but clear, and again he gave that single, solemn bow of acceptance.
“So be it,” the Devil said, and with a snap of his fingers, two leathern waterskins appeared, along with a hunched, wizened imp with skin like grey parchment and eyes that glowed faintly red. “Fill these, and my servant shall guide you to the Stygian Rookery. Do not fail.”
The monk took the waterskins and, using a cupped hand, began to fill them with the clear, cold water that now gushed from the once-dead mountain, each drop seeming to hold a sliver of captured moonlight.
The donkey, who had watched all this with a mixture of residual terror and burgeoning awe, trotted to the monk’s side. “Brother,” it said softly, “though my learning avails little against such– such an adversary, my back is strong, and I shall carry these waters of your sorrow for you.”
The monk nodded his thanks to the donkey, secured the filled waterskins to its back, and then turned to face the little, leering imp, who beckoned them with a bony finger towards a path that seemed to lead into the very bowels of the earth.
The imp led them swiftly along treacherous, narrow ledges that overlooked chasms filled with oily smoke, and through tunnels where unseen things slithered and gibbered in the oppressive darkness.
“Faugh!” coughed the donkey, its usually erudite pronouncements devolving into splutters. “The very air here is an affront to theology! It smells of burnt arguments and the despair of excommunicated logicians!”
At length, the imp pointed to a sprawling, ramshackle collection of black-timbered buildings huddled beneath a blood-red cliff, from which arose a cacophony of drunken shouts, screams of pain, and the clashing of ill-used steel – the Stygian Rookery.
“Here you are, holy ones,” the imp cackled, its red eyes gleaming with malice. “Make it shine like your master’s heaven, or your hides will make new bellows for my lord’s forge!” And with a puff of greasy smoke, it too was gone.
Steeling themselves, the monk and the donkey passed under a crude archway of blackened bones into the Rookery proper, where burly men with scarred faces diced for stolen jewels, gaunt women with hollow eyes peddled watered-down poisons, and mangy dogs fought over scraps in the filth-strewn alleys.
None paid the slightest heed to the silent monk or his trembling ass, so engrossed were they in their squabbles, their cheating, and their casual cruelties.
The monk found a broken bucket, filled it from one of the waterskins, and began to scrub at a patch of blood-and-wine-stained cobblestones near a reeking gutter, his movements calm and deliberate.
“Brother, with all due reverence for penitential tears,” the donkey muttered, keeping a wary eye on a one-eyed man sharpening a rusty cleaver, “we’ll need an ocean of such water and a legion of celestial scrub-maidens to make this sty fit for a cherub’s passing glance, let alone for angels to tread!”
Soon, a few of the denizens, a drunken bravo and his slatternly companion, noticed the monk’s quiet labour and began to jeer, calling out, “Ho, look at the mad priest! Does he think to wash away our sins with ditchwater?”
One of them kicked over the monk’s bucket, spilling the precious water, while another threw a rotten fish head that struck the monk’s cowl, but he merely refilled his bucket and continued his work.
Then a hush fell over the nearby ruffians as a large, heavily armed man with a beard like a tangled black briar and a jagged scar across his nose pushed his way through the crowd, a murderous-looking axe resting on his shoulder.
“Well now, what have we here?” the brigand chief growled, his voice like gravel. “A mute sermon in soap and water? Do you mean to insult our honest trade of thievery and murder with your misplaced piety, little father?”
The monk looked up at the towering brigand, then calmly dipped a rag into his bucket of now somewhat murky holy water, knelt, and began to gently wipe the caked mud and blood from the chief’s heavy leather boots.
A stunned silence fell upon the Stygian Rookery; even the dice-players paused, their hands frozen above their jewels, as all eyes fixed upon the silent monk diligently cleaning the boots of their most feared and bloodthirsty leader.
The brigand chief stared down at the monk for a full minute, his scarred face unreadable, then grunted, “Well, carry on then, if you’ve a taste for filth. But make them shine, priest, or you’ll lick them clean with your tongue.”
And so the monk cleaned the chief’s boots until they shone, and then, to the astonishment of the donkey, one or two of the watching women, perhaps shamed by the monk’s diligence or the chief’s grudging permission, picked up rags and began to listlessly wipe at a nearby table or doorway.
More followed, men and women, at first furtively, then with a strange, almost forgotten diligence, until a small circle of comparative cleanliness began to spread outwards from where the monk patiently worked with his sacred water.
“Perchance this is the ‘ministerium lavacri’ in its most literal form!” the donkey whispered to a nearby rat (which merely blinked). “An ablutionary contagion! Or perhaps the very stones cry out for sanctity when so blessed by a true penitent’s efforts!”
The brigand chief stood with his arms crossed, his scarred face a mask of bewilderment and something akin to a deep, unfamiliar discomfort as he watched his den of iniquity slowly being tidied.
By the time the blood-red sun began to dip below the jagged peaks surrounding the Rookery, the main square and several of the larger hovels, though still wretched, were now free of the worst of their filth and grime, the air noticeably less foul.
With the last ray of sunlight, the Devil reappeared in the center of the now strangely subdued square, the faint scent of brimstone momentarily overwhelming the damp smell of scrubbed stone and wet earth.
He looked around slowly, at the damply clean cobblestones, at the thieves and murderers awkwardly holding scrubbing rags, at the brigand chief who now stood uncertainly by a newly washed horse-trough, and his eyes like burning coals narrowed to slits.
“Clean enough for angels to pass without soiling their little white feet, I suppose,” the Devil conceded, his voice a low snarl. “You have a– peculiar talent for inspiring the dregs, little monk. Two tasks fulfilled.”
“But the third task,” and here a terrible smile stretched his lips, revealing rows of needle-sharp teeth, “ah, the third task will make your weeping mountain and your scrubbed sty seem like a child’s summer game. For the third task, little monk, you must make God Himself curse your name.”
At these words, the Jesuit donkey, which had regained some of its composure, simply fainted dead away, its legs stiffening in the air for a moment before it crashed to the stones; and the monk himself staggered back, his face a mask of such utter desolation as no mortal tongue could describe.
“Yes,” the Devil purred, observing their distress with satisfaction, “you must find the spirit of that innocent sister whose blood you caused to flow, the one for whom your mountain wept, and you must, by your own will and action, deliver her soul unto me for eternal torment. Only such a betrayal of innocence, offered freely by you, would surely earn God’s explicit curse upon your head.”
“You have until the next new moon, when no light shines in the sky, to bring her to the Desolate Altar that stands in the Valley of Lost Prayers, where even echoes die of loneliness. Fail, or refuse, and the previous terms regarding your souls still apply.”
And with a final, chilling laugh that promised eternal winter, the Devil vanished, leaving the monk kneeling beside his senseless companion in the now terrifyingly clean square of the Stygian Rookery, the silence broken only by the distant howl of a damned soul.
For a day and a night, the monk did not move from that spot, his eyes fixed on the place where the Devil had stood, his body as cold and rigid as the gargoyles that leered from the Rookery’s crooked gables.
At last, the donkey stirred, groaned, and shakily got to its feet. “Brother,” it quavered, nudging the monk’s unresponsive arm, “this is– this is an abomination. But even the Doctors of the Church admit that God’s mercy is wider than the Devil’s malice. We must– we must think. Or at least, flee.”
Slowly, very slowly, the monk raised his head, and from his eyes, which had been dry since the mountain wept, two fresh tears welled and fell upon the ground, making small, dark circles in the dust of the purified square.
Then, in a voice so low the donkey barely heard it, a voice cracked with an agony that seemed to encompass all the sorrow of the world, the monk spoke his first public words: “My God, my God– why hast Thou forsaken me?”
And no sooner had the words left his lips than a light, brighter than a thousand suns, blazed down from the heavens, momentarily blinding both monk and donkey, and a Voice, like the sound of many waters yet gentle as a mother’s sigh, spoke from the heart of the radiance.
“My son, whom I have not forsaken,” the Voice thundered and whispered, “the path of shadows is trod by all, but the curse of betrayal is not yours to choose. Seek the heart of your first sorrow, not to offer it to darkness, but to find there the key to an unbinding. I shall be with you.”
Then the light faded, the Voice was gone, and the only sound was the donkey’s ragged breathing; but the monk now stood tall, his eyes no longer filled with desolation, but with a strange, calm light of their own.
“Did– did you– was that–?” the donkey stammered, its voice trembling. “By all the blessed martyrs and the Council of Nicaea! That was no mere auditory hallucination brought on by brimstone fumes! That was– the Logos itself, I fancy!”
The monk laid a calming hand on the donkey’s quivering neck and then, with a gesture, indicated they should leave the Stygian Rookery, but not towards the Desolate Altar the Devil had named.
“But brother,” protested the donkey, “the Desolate Altar lies yonder, by the Devil’s own map, if such a fiend can be said to possess cartographical integrity! Are we not bound by his infernal schedule?”
The monk simply looked at his companion with those calm, strangely lit eyes, and there was such newfound peace and resolve in his gaze that the donkey fell silent and followed without further question.
He led them away from the grim north, back towards the region of the weeping mountain, though he took a different, even more overgrown path that seemed to lead into a valley he had not seen before, a place of deep stillness and ancient trees.
This valley was filled with old, gnarled fruit trees that bore no fruit, and the air was thick with the scent of fallen leaves and damp earth, yet strangely, small, pale flowers bloomed in patches as if watered by unseen tears.
The monk dismounted and walked slowly through this quiet, melancholic place, his eyes scanning the ground, his hands held loosely at his sides, as if expecting to find something precious and long lost.
At the foot of the oldest, most twisted apple tree, half-hidden by ferns and creeping ivy, he stopped before a small, weathered stone, no bigger than a loaf of bread, that seemed to be an ancient, unmarked grave.
The monk knelt before this humble stone, and for a long time he remained there, not weeping now, but with his head bowed, his silent lips moving as if in a conversation only he and the occupant of that lonely grave could hear.
Then, he reached into the small pouch at his belt, the one in which he had carried the monastery’s bread, and took out not food, but a tiny, intricately carved wooden bird, no bigger than his thumb.
This little bird was worn smooth with age, and the monk cradled it in his palm as if it were the most precious thing in all the world, a toy he himself had carved for his little sister in those long-ago days before the snows and the silence.
He placed the wooden bird gently upon the mossy gravestone, and then, taking a sharp thorn from a nearby wild rose bush, he pricked his own forefinger and let three drops of his own blood fall upon the tiny carving.
As the third drop of blood touched the wood, the little bird shivered, its carved wings fluttered, and then it rose into the air, no longer wood but a living creature of purest white, circled the monk’s head once, and sang a single, impossibly sweet note.
Then the white bird flew purposefully, not towards the Devil’s domain in the North, nor back towards the monastery, but eastward, towards a range of mist-shrouded mountains the monk had not noticed before, and its song beckoned him to follow.
The monk rose, a profound understanding dawning in his eyes; this was the ‘key to an unbinding’ of which the Voice had spoken. He would not go to the Desolate Altar to betray his sister, but follow her spirit to wherever it might lead.
“Well, brother,” said the donkey, who had watched all this with utter stupefaction, its theological frameworks quite shattered, “that was not in any of my books. But where a singing white bird of sorrow leads a silent monk, a Jesuit ass can only follow. Lead on.”
And so, with the little white bird circling and singing just ahead of them, visible only to the monk, they left the valley of old sorrows and began their ascent into the mist-wreathed eastern peaks, their hearts uncertain, but no longer broken.
Far behind them, in the grim northern lands, a terrible black storm rose above the Devil’s fortress, and the sound of his rageful howls echoed even to the foothills of the eastern mountains, shaking the very earth, but the little white bird sang on, undeterred.
The monk looked back once at the distant storm of darkness, then turned his gaze to the singing bird, a tiny speck of unwavering light against the vast, misty canvas of the unknown mountains they now climbed.
The little white bird led them eastward, away from the weeping mountain and the valley of old sorrows, towards a range of peaks that shimmered in the morning light as if carved from pearl and amethyst.
Its song was no longer a single sweet note, but a continuous, clear melody that seemed to quiet the wind and ease the ache in their weary bones.
"'Tis a remarkable departure from the sulphurous emanations and cacophonous despair to which we have lately been accustomed, brother,'" the donkey observed, its ears pricked with renewed interest. "'This air possesses an almost Olympian serenity, though thankfully without the attendant risk of capricious deities transforming one into a spider.'"
The monk, though his face remained grave, felt a lightness in his chest he had not known since before the first snows of his long silence fell upon his youth.
The bird led them higher, until they came to a deep and narrow chasm, its bottom lost in shadow, spanned only by a single, moss-covered log as round as a man’s torso.
The little white bird landed on the log, hopped three times, and as it did, the log seemed to settle, revealing a narrow, flattened strip along its top, barely wide enough for the donkey’s hooves, but stable and secure.
"'Now that,'" the donkey declared with admiration, "'is true artistry! Not like that vulgar fiend with his fire and brimstone and poorly constructed syllogisms of damnation. This is elegance, brother, pure theological engineering!'"
The monk watched the bird with a gentle wonder, pondering its calm surety and the way it turned peril into passage without any sound of thunder or display of force.
Beyond the chasm, they found a small, hidden dell where a spring of water, clearer than any crystal, bubbled up from beneath a rock adorned with tiny, star-like flowers.
The white bird dipped its beak into the spring, and the water where it touched shimmered with a soft, silvery light for a moment before the bird took to the air again, urging them upwards.
Higher still they climbed, into mountains so wreathed in swirling mists that at times the little white bird was but a fleeting speck, or vanished altogether for long, heart-stopping moments.
"'Tis like trying to follow a thought in a madman's dream, brother!'" the donkey fretted, its voice tight with anxiety. "'If we lose our feathered Virgil in this empyrean soup, we are like to wander until the Last Trumpet itself!'"
But the monk pressed on, his head often cocked as if listening for a sound only he could hear, his gaze fixed on the subtle currents within the roiling vapours.
The mist parted suddenly to reveal their next trial: a bridge of ropes and weathered planks, swaying perilously over a chasm so deep that no sound arose from its shadowed depths, many of its ropes snapped and trailing like forgotten sighs.
"'Absolutely not!' declared the donkey, planting its hooves firmly. 'My esteemed authors, from Augustine to Aquinas, are universally silent on the spiritual benefits of self-chumming in misty abysses! Some other way, brother, I implore you!'
The monk dismounted, and after a moment of looking into the donkey's wide, terrified eyes, he simply took its bridle and, with a soft murmur, stepped onto the first swaying plank himself, his own weight a careful test upon the ancient ropes.
Halfway across, as a rogue wind howled up from the chasm, making the bridge dance like a puppet, the white bird reappeared, landing lightly on the most frayed rope, and with each note of its song, the strands visibly tightened and grew strong.
Thus they reached the other side, where the donkey promptly lay down, its whole body one great tremble, and licked the monk's hand with a fervor usually reserved for unexpected salt-licks.
The monk, looking back at the now-steady bridge, saw a single, pure white feather lying where the bird had momentarily rested on the mended rope, and he picked it up, tucking it carefully into his robe.
The bird, now waiting patiently on an outcrop above them, chirped once and then flew towards a dark fissure in the cliff face, a cave mouth hung with icicles like a dragon’s fangs.
With some trepidation, the donkey followed the monk into the narrow cave, the white bird now glowing with a soft, internal luminescence, casting just enough light to show the damp, glistening walls.
The passage soon opened into a circular chamber, its walls formed of a dark, polished stone that seemed to absorb the bird’s light, yet gave back faint, distorted reflections of the monk and the donkey.
Every shuffle of a hoof, every rustle of the monk’s robe, was caught by the strange acoustics and returned as a chorus of faint whispers, as if the cave itself were listening and murmuring back.
The donkey attempted to offer a learned remark on troglodytic architecture, but its first syllable exploded into a thousand chattering replies, and it clamped its jaw shut with a disgruntled snort.
The monk, gazing at his own shadowy form upon the wall, thought he saw his lips move, as if he were speaking with great animation, but when he blinked, the reflection was as still and silent as himself.
The white bird, however, seemed untroubled by the echoes and led them to the far side of the chamber, where a perfectly round pool of water lay, its surface as smooth and dark as a dragon’s scale.
As the monk gazed into its depths, he saw no reflection of the cave or himself, but instead, clear as day, the image of a little girl with hair like spun moonlight, laughing as she chased a painted butterfly in a sunlit meadow.
The laughing girl vanished, and his own face stared back at him from the dark water, still etched with sorrow, yet the utter desolation he had seen there before seemed to have lessened, replaced by a profound, quiet ache.
The donkey, peering over the monk’s shoulder, snorted, 'My own reflection is rather more flattering, I must confess. Though your fur is a bit more kempt than mine, I must confess.'
The white bird, which had perched silently on a stalagmite during these reflections, now fluttered towards a dark, narrow opening at the chamber’s farthest end, its light a beacon in the oppressive gloom.
The narrow passage twisted and turned, descending ever deeper, until it suddenly opened into a vast cavern, whose walls, floor, and ceiling were entirely lined with colossal, softly glowing crystals of every conceivable hue, bathing the space in a gentle, ethereal light.
And in the very center of this breathtaking cavern, upon a low, flat slab of milky quartz that served as a natural altar, there lay not the Tear of God they sought, but a single, perfect white rose, its petals still tightly closed like a sleeping secret.
The little white bird flew to the quartz altar and tenderly touched the tip of the closed rosebud with its beak, once, twice, thrice.
At the third touch, the tight green sepals of the rosebud shivered and slowly began to unfurl, revealing the pearly white edges of the petals within, and from its core, a tiny, warm golden light began to shine.
Watching the rose unfurl, the monk felt an almost unbearable pressure in his chest, not of grief this time, but of an urgent, compelling need to speak the unvarnished truth of his broken vow and the price his sister had paid.
He did not fight the urge, but formed the words in his mind, a silent recitation of his youthful folly, the boastful word that had broken his sacred vow of protection, the subsequent ambush in the winter pass, and his sister’s sacrifice to save him.
As these silent thoughts unspooled, the white bird gave a soft trill, transformed into a dazzling mote of pure white light, and flew directly into the golden glow at the heart of the steadily opening rose, vanishing within it.
And then the monk spoke, his voice, though raspy, now clear and strong in the crystalline silence of the cavern, “For my pride, for my broken word, she gave her innocent life. The fault, the sorrow, the silence – all mine.”
As his last word of truth echoed and faded, the white rose, now blazing with an almost unbearable golden light from within, opened its final petal, pulsed once like a living heart, and then dissolved into a million shimmering particles of light that smelled of snowmelt and the first day of spring, leaving the altar bare.
A great sigh shuddered through the monk, as if a mountain of ice that had crushed his heart for decades had suddenly melted away, and he knew, with a certainty that resonated in his very bones, that the vow of silence born of that ancient sorrow was now, and forever, unbound.
The Jesuit donkey, which had been cautiously observing the proceedings from behind a large amethyst crystal, nearly swallowed its own tongue, its eyes wider than any cathedral rose window.
"'Fear not, old friend,'" the monk said, his voice a little rough, like stones in a stream, but warm and true, "'it seems the winter of my heart has finally broken.'"
At this, the donkey let out a bray that was less a bray and more a combination of a triumphant trumpet call, a theologian’s Eureka, and a very happy hiccup, its whole body wiggling with delight.
And there, upon the bare quartz altar where the rose had bloomed and vanished, now lay a single, perfect drop of light, like a solidified moonbeam – the Tear of God.
A deep understanding illuminated the monk’s face: the Tear of God was not a thing to be stolen by fiends, but a gift that could only be received by a heart that had relearned how to weep for the sorrows of the world, and for its own.
He reached out and gently took the Tear of God; it felt warm in his palm, like a living jewel, and pulsed with a soft, compassionate light that mirrored the newfound peace in his own soul.
"'A most edifying revelation, brother,'" the donkey said, its voice now calm and thoughtful. "'But what of the Devil's third task? The Desolate Altar? The unspeakable betrayal he demanded? The new moon, I recall, is not far off.'"
"'God does not seek forced curses, nor damnation through a tormented soul's betrayal,'" the monk replied, his voice gentle but firm. "'The Devil offered a path of despair; God offered a way of unbinding. We shall face him, but not on his terms, nor at his Desolate Altar.'"
As he spoke, the light from the Tear of God in his hand intensified, and the glowing crystals of the cavern resonated with it, illuminating the passage out with a clear, inviting radiance.
And so, with the Tear of God safely in the monk's pouch, his voice returned, and his heart unbound from its ancient sorrow, he and his faithful Jesuit donkey turned from the empty altar and walked towards the welcoming light, ready for the world once more.
They emerged from the crystal cave into the sharp, clean air of the high mountains, the passage sealing itself with a soft rumble behind them as if it had never been.
"We must find him, friend donkey," the monk said, his voice gaining strength with each word. "Not to do his bidding, but to answer his challenge with the truth God has shown me."
"Seek him? Brother, are you certain?" the donkey asked, its ears swiveling nervously. "His displeasure was... notable. But your eyes now hold a light that was not there before; I shall follow, though my knees feel like unset pudding."
They descended the eastern slopes, the mists thinning below them, and soon they stood upon a wide, windswept plateau, the dark smudge of the Devil's northern lands a brooding shadow on the far horizon.
But before they could take a step towards that darkness, the air before them shimmered with black fire, and the Devil stood there, his eyes burning with an icy rage, his shadow stretching long and terrible in the clear light.
"So, the little monk has found his tongue, and thinks to choose his own terms?" the Devil sneered, his voice cracking like a breaking glacier. "Did you imagine I would not know you had forsaken the path to the Desolate Altar, you pious fraud?"
"I have not forsaken the path of truth, only the path of despair you laid for me," the monk replied, his voice clear and carrying over the wind. "I have come to answer your challenge concerning my God and my sister's spirit."
The Devil threw back his head and laughed, a sound like rocks tumbling into a void. "Answer? You think to answer me, you whose soul is already forfeit by your past? Very well, let this desolate place be your altar. Show me how God does not curse such as you!"
The monk did not flinch, but drew forth the Tear of God, its gentle light a stark contrast to the Devil's consuming darkness, and he held it before him as a shield and a lantern, his lips moving in a silent prayer for strength.
Then the Devil raised his hand, and a palpable wave of freezing despair and utter hopelessness washed over the plateau, seeking to extinguish the monk's spirit and the light of the Tear.
The monk gasped and staggered under the spiritual onslaught, but the Tear of God pulsed with a fierce, warm light, and the wave of despair broke against it like water upon a rock, leaving him shaken but unharmed.
"You resist the void?" the Devil roared, his eyes blazing with hotter fire. "Then witness the true fruits of your life!" And swirling illusions of the monk's youthful arrogance, the broken vow, and his sister's dying moments in the snow began to form around them.
The monk flinched as the phantom snow chilled him and his sister's imagined cry pierced his heart, yet he held the Tear of God aloft, and its light seemed to pass through the illusions, revealing them as empty shadows, not living realities.
"Your sacrifice, beloved sister," the monk said, his voice trembling but strong, addressing the illusion, "was not an end, but the seed of an unbinding. Your innocent blood called not for my damnation, but for the tears that would water a dead mountain and a broken heart."
As he spoke these words, the Tear of God in his hand pulsed with an incandescent light, and the phantoms of snow and sorrow shivered and began to dissolve like mist in a sudden sunbeam.
"Lies! Sentimental babble!" the Devil shrieked, shielding his eyes from the Tear's brilliance as his carefully crafted torments turned to dust and blew away on the wind.
"You asked me to make God curse my name by an act of ultimate betrayal," the monk stated, his voice now resonating with a quiet power. "But the God I have come to know through sorrow and unbinding seeks not the curse, but the turning of the heart."
And as he finished speaking, the Tear of God shone with a light so pure, so filled with an unutterable compassion for all things, even for the Prince of Lies himself, that it seemed to pierce the Devil to his very core.
The Devil howled, a sound of utter agony and disbelief, as if the light were both a fire and an ice that seared his ancient pride, and his dark form began to smoke and shrink, losing its terrible majesty.
"This is not over, priest!" he shrieked, his voice fading into a distant echo, "But this round... this round is yours!" And then he was utterly gone, and the clean wind swept across the plateau, carrying away the last scent of his corruption.
The monk sank to his knees, not in despair this time, but in sheer, bone-deep weariness, the Tear of God in his palm now a gentle, lambent pearl of light.
The Jesuit donkey, cautiously raising its head, blinked several times. "Brother," it finally managed, its voice hushed with an uncharacteristic lack of polysyllabic obfuscation, "I believe we have just witnessed something that would render Thomas Aquinas himself momentarily speechless. An apotheosis, perhaps? Or at least a very convincing refutation of Manichaean dualism."
The monk looked at his faithful companion and smiled, a slow, weary, but profoundly peaceful smile. "It was God's mercy, old friend," he said, his voice now carrying a quiet warmth, "and the enduring love of a little sister."
He felt a profound certainty that his sister's spirit was not a pawn for the Devil to claim, but a guiding star that had led him through his darkest night, now free and luminous as the Tear itself.
Looking towards the grim northern lands, it seemed to the monk that the oppressive shadow hovering there had thinned, as if a suffocating blanket had been partially lifted from that blighted realm.
"Come, friend donkey," the monk said, rising slowly to his feet. "Our task from the Abbot is not yet complete. We must return the Tear of God to its rightful place."
The donkey, with a solemnity that would have impressed a conclave of cardinals, knelt to allow the monk to mount. "Indeed, brother. And perhaps," it added with a hopeful flick of its ears, "they will have replenished the library with some fresher commentaries by then."
As the monk settled on the donkey's back, he felt a faint warmth from his robe and, drawing out the white feather, saw that it now shone with a tiny, pearlescent light, as if blessed by the Tear's passage.
With a last look at the now peaceful, sunlit plateau where so much terror had unfolded, the monk gently urged the donkey southwards, towards the distant promise of home.
And the wind that blew now seemed to whisper not of despair, but of ancient blessings and the turning of a long, sorrowful tide.
Their journey back through the dark forest was swifter and less fraught with peril than their outward passage; the trees seemed to part for them, and the unseen creatures of the wood remained quiet and hidden.
Once, the great stag they had freed from the iron trap stepped from the trees, watched them pass with its wise, dark eyes, then dipped its magnificent antlers in a clear salute before melting back into the green shadows.
"A creature of noble bearing and, it would appear, commendable memory," the donkey remarked with satisfaction. "Civility in the sylvan realm is a welcome novelty, I must say."
The monk, for his part, found himself humming a quiet, wordless melody, a tune he had not realized he remembered from the days before his vow of silence, a simple air that spoke of sunlight on a monastery wall.
And it seemed to the donkey that where the monk’s quiet tune fell, or where the light from the hidden Tear touched the path, tiny, forgotten wildflowers of blue and gold would briefly unfurl before closing again as they passed.
When they came again to the clearing of the ancient oak, there was no sign of the old woman's hut, only the rustle of leaves and the scent of damp earth, as if it had only ever existed in a dream of the deep woods.
"A most perplexing ontology," the donkey mused, looking at the empty space. "Was she a figment, a sylvan spirit, or merely a very efficient housekeeper with a penchant for dramatic exits? Yet her words, brother, her words remain etched upon my soul."
The monk merely smiled. "The truth she spoke was real enough, old friend, and that is all that matters to our path."
At long last, they saw the edge of the great forest, and with a shared sigh of relief, they stepped out from beneath its ancient canopy into the bright sunlight of open fields, the air smelling of cut hay and distant villages.
With the Tear of God resting like a warm ember in his pouch, and its light a quiet hope in his heart, the monk and his faithful donkey set their faces towards home, the grim northern lands now but a dark memory behind them.
They passed through villages where children stopped their play to stare at the tall, grave monk who now sometimes spoke in a low, gentle voice, and at the donkey that occasionally offered surprisingly cogent advice on crop rotation.
To those who were troubled, the monk offered quiet words of comfort drawn from his long silence and recent trials, and his gaze was filled with a deep, unjudging compassion.
And it was said in those villages afterwards that for a short while after the pair had passed, old grudges were forgotten, and a strange, sweet peace would settle upon the marketplace or the fields.
The donkey, meanwhile, occasionally found itself drawn into quite complex debates with local reeves or learned elders on matters of canon law or the proper interpretation of obscure prophets, often leaving them blinking in bemused admiration.
Sometimes, a cold wind would blow from the distant north, carrying a faint scent of ash, and the donkey would shiver, but the monk would only touch the pouch where the Tear lay, and the chill would pass.
The monk often took out the Tear in the quiet of the evenings, and its light was a small, steady flame in the twilight, a reminder of the love that had called it forth and the peace it promised.
One afternoon, as they crested a familiar hill, the donkey let out a joyful bray, for there below them, nestled in its quiet valley, lay the grey stone walls and familiar bell tower of their own dear monastery.
"Ah, the hallowed scriptorium! The scent of old parchment and beeswax!" the donkey exclaimed. "And perhaps, just perhaps, a truly fresh bale of hay, untainted by the philosophical miasmas of the road!"
The monk, too, felt a deep gladness, yet also a tremor of something unnameable, for he was returning not as the silent, afflicted brother who had left, but as one who had journeyed through hell and touched heaven.
Together, the monk with the Tear of God and the donkey with its trove of new anecdotes, began their final descent into the valley, towards the familiar, welcoming gates of their spiritual home.
But as they neared the monastery gates, a strange stillness fell upon the land; the birdsong ceased, the vibrant colours of the late summer flowers seemed dulled, and a patch of usually fertile ground by the road was inexplicably blighted and grey.
Peering through the half-open gates, they saw that the monks within moved slowly, their shoulders slumped, and a pall of inexplicable sorrow seemed to hang over the usually bustling courtyard; even the Abbot’s prize roses drooped, their petals tinged with an unhealthy brown.
"By the lamentations of Jeremiah!" the donkey whispered, its earlier joviality gone. "This has the melancholic stink of accidie about it, brother, a spiritual lethargy most foul! The fiend's shadow lingers, or the absence of the Tear has starved their souls too long!"
The monk looked upon the afflicted monastery, his heart aching with a compassion that was now his very essence, and he knew this was the Devil's last, sly arrow, or perhaps God's final test of the Tear's true purpose.
He walked into the courtyard, the donkey at his side, and raising the Tear of God so its gentle light shone upon his brothers, he began to speak, his voice no longer low, but resonant with the peace he had found.
"My brothers," he said, his voice carrying to every shadowed corner, "though the path may lead through valleys of sorrow and the Devil's own ice, God's mercy is a hidden spring, and His compassion a tear that can make even dead mountains weep with life."
And as he spoke, the Tear in his hand pulsed in harmony with his words, and its light spread like warm honey, touching the drooping roses, the grey stones, and the downcast faces of the monks.
Slowly, one by one, the monks lifted their heads; a little color returned to their cheeks, a spark of interest to their eyes, as if a forgotten window had been opened in a long-closed room.
The Abbot's prize roses seemed to sigh and stretch, a faint blush of pink returning to their petals, and outside the gates, the blighted patch of earth looked a little less grey, a little more hopeful.
And the monk continued to speak, his voice now like a clear bell, telling not of despair but of the unshakeable solace he had found, and as he did, the very stones of the monastery seemed to drink in the light and grow warm.
By noon, the strange oppressive sorrow had entirely lifted from the monastery; monks were bustling about their duties with renewed vigor, their voices raised in cheerful plainsong, and the Abbot himself was seen pruning his roses with a joyful, if slightly bewildered, expression.
The monk, with the Tear of God still glowing softly, approached the Abbot, who rushed forward, his earlier bewilderment replaced by tears of profound joy and gratitude, and received the sacred relic as if it were the salvation of the world.
Placed back upon its silken cushion in the chapel, the Tear of God shone with a steady, unwavering light that filled the sacred space with an almost palpable peace, a light that seemed to seep into the very stones and timbers of the ancient building.
And the monk, who had once been known only for his silence, was now sought out by his brothers for his quiet counsel, for his voice, when he chose to use it, spoke with the gentle wisdom of one who had faced the deepest darkness and returned with light.
As for the Jesuit donkey, he was given a specially built stall near the scriptorium, a lifetime supply of the finest oats and apples, and the unprecedented title of 'Brother Prelector Asinorum', whose learned opinions on obscure texts were now quoted with surprising frequency by the Abbot himself.
The monk, in his newfound voice, often told stories to the younger novices, not of damnation, but of the stubborn hope that can bloom even in frozen lands, and of the unlooked-for grace that can mend a heart, a mountain, or even a misbegotten vow.
Under the Tear's steady light and the monk's quiet guidance, the monastery flourished as never before, becoming known throughout the land as a place of profound peace, deep learning, and an almost tangible compassion that touched all who visited.
And though tales sometimes drifted down from the far northern lands of a lessened shadow and a tyrant's diminished rage, the Devil never again troubled the valley of the monastery nor the monk who had answered his challenge with a weeping heart.
The monk lived to a great age, his voice a comfort and his silence a deep well of peace, and the white feather he carried always retained its soft, pearlescent glow.
And the Tear of God, it is said, still shines in that little chapel, a beacon against all despair, a testament to the sorrow that unbinds, and the enduring light that can be found in the most broken of hearts.
Word of the monk who spoke with the wisdom of angels and the compassion of saints spread throughout the land, and many troubled souls journeyed to the monastery seeking his counsel.
He taught them not with intricate dogma, but by listening with his whole being, and by sharing the simple truth that even in the deepest shadow, a single Tear of God, a single act of true repentance, could bring forth an unexpected spring.
The Jesuit donkey, too, often held informal lectures in the guesthouse, his disquisitions on the nature of divine intervention versus diabolical trickery becoming legendary for their wit, if not always for their conciseness.
And the story of the monk's long silence, of the weeping mountain and the Stygian Rookery, and of the sister whose love became a guiding bird, was carefully written down by the Abbot himself, becoming a treasured part of the monastery's lore.
Pilgrims who came to pray before the Tear of God reported no thunderous visions, but rather a profound stillness that settled in their hearts, an easing of old burdens, and a quiet understanding of their own deepest sorrows.
For many, the greatest blessing was simply to sit in the presence of the old monk, whose eyes held the wisdom of the abyss and the serenity of the dawn, and whose rare smile felt like a benediction.
And it was said that many who came to him burdened by unspeakable griefs or vows of their own making found, in his quiet presence, the courage to face their own weeping mountains and find their own 'key to an unbinding'.
The shadow in the distant northern lands did not vanish entirely, for evil is a stubborn weed, but it grew thinner, less bold, as if the very existence of the Tear and the story of its finding acted as a constant, gentle rebuke to its ancient despair.
The tale of the silent monk who spoke to God, the Jesuit donkey who debated with devils, and the Tear that healed a broken world became a song sung by minstrels and a lesson taught by sages.
And so, the monastery of the Silent Monk (as he was still affectionately, if inaccurately, called) remained a sanctuary of true light, where every soul, it was said, could find a path through its own dark forest and discover the Tear of God within its own repentant heart.
Years passed, and the valley where the monastery stood became known as the Vale of Consolation, for no traveler passed through it without feeling their burdens eased and their spirit lifted by an unseen grace.
The monk, now with hair as white as the bird that had once guided him, wrote down his story and his understanding of the Tear, not as a relic of stone, but as the living compassion that mends the world.
His old friend, the donkey, now of a truly patriarchal dignity, would often add learned footnotes to these teachings, sometimes to the monk's gentle amusement, citing obscure Church Fathers who had, in its opinion, almost grasped these truths.
And the little white feather, found on the perilous bridge, was placed in a silver locket beside the Tear of God, a testament to the small, pure guide that had shown the way when all seemed lost.
It was said the monk never again felt the crushing weight of his youthful sin, for the Tear had washed it clean, not by forgetting, but by transforming it into a boundless empathy for all who suffered.
Travelers from the north sometimes reported that the glaciers in the Devil's domain seemed to weep a little more each spring, and tiny, stubborn flowers were seen pushing through the permafrost in places where only ice had reigned.
The Tear of God itself never diminished, and any soul who knelt before it with a truly contrite heart was said to feel its warm, forgiving light touch their own deepest wound.
The monk and his erudite donkey were often seen walking together in the monastery gardens at twilight, the former speaking softly of mysteries, the latter occasionally offering a surprisingly insightful Latin quotation in reply.
And the tale of their journey became the Abbot's favorite sermon, a lesson on how even a silent monk burdened by a terrible past, accompanied by a pedantic but faithful ass, could, through penitence and divine guidance, bring back a Tear of God to a wounded world.
Thus, the Vale of Consolation remained a haven, and the memory of the monk's ordeal and reward a quiet song of hope that echoed through its peaceful hills and fertile fields for all time to come.
The monk lived out his many remaining years in that peaceful valley, his voice ever gentle, his counsel ever wise, his heart forever unbound.
The Jesuit donkey, it is said, completed a truly monumental twelve-volume commentary on the Psalms, which, though dense, was widely considered a triumph of both piety and meticulous footnoting.
The Tear of God continued to shine in the monastery chapel, a soft, unwavering light that spoke to all who saw it of a compassion that could embrace all sorrow and a love that never failed.
And pilgrims would still come from afar, not only to see the Tear, but to hear the old monk speak of the path through shadow, and to ask the learned donkey about the proper use of the ablative absolute in times of spiritual crisis.
The story of the little sister, whose love had manifested as the guiding white bird, was often told to novices as a lesson that the purest love can shine even from beyond the veil of death, and that innocence itself holds a power against which even the Devil cannot stand.
And though the Devil still roamed the world, seeking whom he might devour, it was known that his shadow never again dared to fall upon the Vale of Consolation, for the light of the Tear and the memory of the monk's unbinding were too strong a shield.
The single white feather, kept in the silver locket, never lost its pearlescent glow, and it was said that if one held it to one's ear, one could still hear the faint, sweet echo of an unearthly song.
From a monk silenced by a childhood tragedy to a sage whose words brought healing to thousands, his life became a testament that no sorrow was too great to be unmade by love, and no silence too deep to be broken by the truth of a repentant heart.
And so, in that valley, the Tear of God continued to offer its gentle solace, the donkey continued to offer its learned (if lengthy) consolations, and the spirit of the monk who had once been silent continued to speak of hope to all who would listen.
And if they have not gone on to their greater reward, they are living there still, in peace and gentle wisdom, to this very day.
