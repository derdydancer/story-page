ACT I
Scene 1: A Flourishing Realm
(Setting: The sunlit gardens of the Royal Palace. KING PETER smiles, watching his sons. PRINCE PHILIP, a youth, reads a large book. PRINCE WILLIAM, younger, observes a butterfly. QUEEN ANNA stands nearby, beautiful but with a subtle weariness.)
KING PETER:
My dearest Anna, see our kingdom bright,
Bathed in a gentle, peace-bestowing light.
Your wisdom guides, your kindness warms each heart,
And life itself seems like a gentle art.
QUEEN ANNA:
(A faint smile, her eyes betraying strain)
Your words are kind, my lord, and much rings true,
Yet a strange shadow chills my spirit through.
I beg you, grant me leave to cross the sea,
To find what cure may set my spirit free.
KING PETER:
(His smile erased, concern upon his face)
Your wish, my Queen, inflicts a bitter wound,
But if it brings you solace, whole and sound,
Then with a heavy heart, I bid you go.
May healing currents in your spirit flow.
(QUEEN ANNA inclines her head, a complex look of relief and sorrow. She exits. PHILIP watches her, his brow knit with youthful worry. WILLIAM observes a falling leaf, a mirror to the moment's melancholy. KING PETER sighs, a shadow crossing his own features.)
Scene 2: The Sorcerer's Tower
(Setting: A desolate shore beneath a sky of bruised twilight. A stark, black tower pierces the gloom. QUEEN ANNA, weary but resolute, approaches. An unseen force groans the tower door ajar.)
(Inside, THE SORCERER, tall and robed in shades of night, regards her from a throne-like chair. His eyes are chips of ice.)
SORCERER:
(His voice, a rustle of dry leaves, or wind through winter bone)
I know your purpose, Queen, why you have come,
To still a heart by shadows overcome,
But every balm my ancient craft can deed,
Demands a tribute for the spirit's need.
What will you offer, from your life's bright store,
To feel that shadow on your soul no more?
QUEEN ANNA:
(Voice trembling, raw with hope and deep despair)
If your strange wisdom can this torment end,
And this bruised, weary spirit truly mend,
Then ask for anything, I'll give my all,
If from my soul this crushing weight will fall!
SORCERER:
(A smile like winter frost on barren ground)
Not fleeting treasures, nor what men may hold
In high esteem, like glittering gems or gold.
When next you cherish, save your kith and kin,
A thing of beauty, joy that burns within,
A sliver of its brightest, purest gleam
Shall be my fee, to banish your dark dream.
Agree to this, and find your spirit's ease,
From haunting shadows, gain a sweet release.
QUEEN ANNA:
(A moment's pause, then, breathlessly, she nods)
A sliver of its joy? That is the price?
A meagre cost for such a sacrifice
Of all this gloom! Then let my heart be still,
I do agree. Your terms I shall fulfill!
(THE SORCERER lifts a slender hand. A chill, like frozen starlight, touches ANNA's brow. She shudders, then a visible wave of peace smoothes her features. Her eyes, for a moment, regain their former light.)
(She turns, a lightness in her step not seen for years. As she departs, an almost invisible filament of shadow, dark as the SORCERER's robe, unspools from her, tethering her back to the tower.)
SORCERER:
(To himself, as the Queen's form recedes)
The thread is cast, the subtle magic spun.
What joy she touches now, will be undone.
Scene 3: The Crown and the Cost
(Setting: The Great Hall, vibrant with celebration. QUEEN ANNA, radiant, is welcomed by KING PETER and the COURT.)
KING PETER:
My love, returned! Your vibrant self restored!
The kingdom sings, by all you are adored!
(A COURTIER steps forth, bearing a magnificent CROWN on a velvet cushion. Seven flawless gems adorn it, blazing with an inner light.)
COURTIER 1:
A gift, Your Majesties, from Theron's King,
This crown of unity and joy we bring!
KING PETER:
A treasure worthy! Anna, dear, behold,
Its flawless gems, its artistry in gold!
(He places it in ANNA's hands. She gasps, her eyes alight with genuine love for the object's sheer beauty. She holds it aloft.)
QUEEN ANNA:
Oh, wondrous craftsmanship! So pure, so bright!
It fills my very soul with sheer delight!
(At that instant, a faint, cold tremor runs through the hall. The CROWN's gems visibly lose a fraction of their lustre. ANNA gasps, a hand to her heart, fear dawning. KING PETER frowns, a flicker of unease in his eyes, though others seem oblivious.)
QUEEN ANNA:
(Whispering, aghast)
The light - Did no one else that tremor feel?
As if a breath of joy it meant to steal?
KING PETER:
(Masking his disquiet with a reassuring smile)
The crown is splendid, love, beyond compare.
A trick of light, a shimmer in the air.
(Cheers resume, but ANNA clutches the dimmed crown, a chilling dread enveloping her. KING PETER watches her, his thoughtful gaze now holding a nascent seed of troubled doubt. The unseen thread from the Sorcerer's tower seems to pulse faintly.)
NARRATOR (V.O.):
From that day forward, shadows start to creep,
While Anna's secret slumbered, dark and deep.
The kingdom's vibrant hues began to wane,
A silent harbinger of coming pain.
Scene 4: The King's Despair and the Mirror's Revelation
(Setting: King Peter's private study, some years later. Dust motes dance in sparse moonlight. PETER, visibly aged and deeply troubled, paces. His gaze falls upon a tall object draped in heavy velvet, long untouched in a shadowed corner.)
KING PETER:
(To himself, his voice laden with sorrow)
The years wear on, the kingdom's colours fade,
And Anna walks as if within a shade.
Some hidden canker, something deeply wrong,
Has plagued our joy and peace for far too long.
Old tales recount a Mirror, kept of lore,
That shows what is, and what has passed before.
(He strides to the veiled object, his jaw set with grim resolve. He pulls back the velvet cloth, revealing a tall, ancient Mirror, its surface dark and swirling.)
Mirror of Ages, if old legends speak
The honest truth I now so gravely seek,
Unveil the cause, the sorrow that we keep!
(The mists within the Mirror churn. Slowly, an image forms: QUEEN ANNA before the SORCERER'S TOWER. PETER sees the bargain struck  - 'a sliver of its brightest joy' for her 'heart's ease'. He watches, aghast, as the scene shifts to ANNA holding the new CROWN, its light dimming as she cherishes it. The SORCERER'S triumphant, shadowy form flickers behind her.)
KING PETER:
(Staggering back, a hand clapped to his mouth, his voice a choked whisper)
No - Anna - for your ease - you tore apart
The very kingdom? And my trusting heart?
(The image fades. PETER sinks into a chair, broken. A long silence, filled only with his ragged breathing. Then, a new, steely resolve forms in his grief-stricken eyes. He rises, covers the Mirror again, his movements heavy.)
KING PETER:
(Quietly, to the covered Mirror, and to himself)
This truth - this wound - must never be made known.
For now, this crushing weight I bear alone.
The Queen - her illness deepens. She'll be confined
To distant chambers, for her troubled mind.
Scene 5: The Sundered Land and a Queen in Shadow
(Setting: Years have passed. A vast, impenetrable DARK FOREST OF THORNS now cleaves the kingdom. KING PETER, greyer and his sorrow a constant cloak, oversees a desolate court. QUEEN ANNA is now a recluse in a remote castle wing, rarely seen. PRINCES PHILIP and WILLIAM are young men, shaped by this era of gloom.)
NARRATOR (V.O.):
The dark wood grew, a barrier of thorn,
And from the land all vibrant joy was torn.
The Queen in shadows, by decree, did dwell,
The King, his secret anguish, none could tell.
KING PETER:
(Looking out towards the symbolic forest)
This hateful forest, how it still does stand,
A cleaving wound upon our broken land.
PRINCE PHILIP:
(Now a young man, solemn and observant)
A chilling silence fills each castle room,
As if we live beneath a pall of doom.
PRINCE WILLIAM:
(Quietly, gazing towards the forest's edge)
The ancient trees themselves appear to sigh,
And in its shadow, even songbirds die.
ACT II
Scene 1: A New Queen, A Forbidden Place
(Setting: The Royal Court, some years later. The mood is still subdued, but QUEEN PETRA, gentle and fair, tries to bring warmth. Her young children, SEBASTIAN and JOSEFINE, play with quiet cheer. KING PETER watches them with a sad fondness. QUEEN ANNA, a spectral figure, sometimes observes from deep shadows.)
KING PETER:
(To Petra, with a weary but tender smile)
Your gentle presence, Petra, brings new grace
To this long-shadowed, sorrow-stricken place.
QUEEN PETRA:
My lord, I only wish all hearts to soothe,
And guide your sons towards a gentler truth.
That said, the Royal Preserve, where rare beasts wild
Roam free, should stay pristine and undefiled.
Let none disturb its peace, in your great name,
A sanctuary sacred, we'll proclaim.
KING PETER:
(Nodding absently)
So be it. Let the Preserve sacred stay,
No common foot shall in its borders sway.
(PHILIP overhears this, his gaze sharpens with a sudden, keen interest. From her shadowed alcove, QUEEN ANNA watches PHILIP's reaction, a calculating glint in her eyes.)
Scene 2: Whispers and Resolve
(Setting: QUEEN ANNA's dimly lit, remote chambers. ANNA, frail but with an intense, febrile energy, greets PRINCE PHILIP.)
QUEEN ANNA:
My Philip, come. My brave, my thoughtful son,
You see how shadows have this house outrun.
The new Queen's smiles, your father's weakened reign,
Are but the outward signs of deeper pain.
But in the Royal Preserve, forbidden now,
A secret sleeps, could lift this darkened brow,
Restore my light, my rightful, honored place,
And banish falsehood with truth's healing grace.
PRINCE PHILIP:
(His young face, already etched with care, is easily swayed.)
Mother, your words a heavy truth conveyed,
Our kingdom's heart, by shadows, is betrayed!
If in the Preserve this hidden secret lies,
I'll seek it out, despite the new Queen's spies!
(QUEEN ANNA's eyes gleam with a fevered triumph. As PHILIP turns to leave, resolute, PRINCE WILLIAM emerges silently from a nearby alcove, his expression troubled by the exchange he has partly overheard. He looks from his departing brother to his mother's triumphant face, then towards the unseen Forest, a deep sigh escaping him.)
ACT III
Scene 1: The Royal Preserve and the Wise Woman
(Setting: A moonless night. PRINCE PHILIP, cloaked, slips past sleeping GUARDS and enters the Royal Preserve through an overgrown, hidden gate. The air within is ancient and deeply peaceful. Moonlight filters, creating an ethereal glow.)
PRINCE PHILIP:
(Whispering in awe)
No evil scent, no darkness at its core,
Unlike the palace and its whispered lore.
(He ventures deeper, arriving at a glade where an ancient, silver-barked tree stands beside a spring that bubbles with crystalline water. An OLD WOMAN, clad in simple grey, her face a map of wrinkles, cups water in her hands.)
OLD WOMAN:
(Her voice is like the rustling of autumn leaves, yet clear as the spring)
What troubles stir you, Prince, that you should seek
These shadowed glades, when weary spirits speak?
PRINCE PHILIP:
(Bowing respectfully)
Good mother, I seek reason for the blight
That casts its sorrow on our endless night.
OLD WOMAN:
This is a haven, Prince, a healing place,
Infused with nature's old and quiet grace.
The only shadows here are those one brings,
Or listens to when bitter sorrow sings.
Seek the reflection that denies all lies,
It may show more than what you now surmise.
(She turns and seems to dissolve into the moon-dappled shadows of the ancient trees, leaving PHILIP alone by the spring, her words echoing in his thoughtful mind.)
Scene 2: The Mirror of Past Truths
(Setting: The dusty, cobweb-laden attics of the castle. Days later. PRINCE PHILIP, guided by the Old Woman's riddle and a half-forgotten nurse's tale, searches tirelessly.)
PRINCE PHILIP:
(Muttering to himself, sifting through forgotten relics)
 -Reflection that denies all lies - - What could she mean?
A truth that pierces through the surface scene?
My nurse once spoke - a Mirror, old and vast,
That showed not what is, but what truly passed.
(He pushes aside a heavy tapestry and finds it: a tall glass, its frame darkened with age, covered by a velvet cloth the deep blue of his mother's former ceremonial robes.)
PRINCE PHILIP:
(With trembling hands, he draws the cloth away. The glass beneath is strangely deep, not reflecting his own face, but holding a swirling mist.)
Mirror of Truth, your secrets now reveal,
The story lost, what shadows still conceal!
(The mists swirl and clear. An image forms: his mother, QUEEN ANNA, younger and brighter, before the SORCERER'S TOWER. He sees the bargain struck  - her own  -heart's ease - for  -a sliver of the kingdom's brightest joy -. Then the scene shifts: ANNA holding the new CROWN, her love for it palpable, and the light in its gems dimming as the unseen thread pulls tight. The DARK FOREST springs up, a scar upon the land.)
PRINCE PHILIP:
(Recoiling as if struck, his face paling. The truth is a shard of ice in his heart.)
The truth - it shines so terribly clear -
My mother's choice - for what she held most dear -
Not kingdom's sake, but her own spirit's gain.
The web of blame she wove, the endless pain!
(The image in the Mirror fades. PHILIP covers it slowly, his hands no longer trembling with anticipation, but with a terrible, cold certainty. He descends from the attic a changed man, the innocence of his grief gone, replaced by a heavier knowledge.)
Scene 3: The Queen's Confession, The Kingdom's Hope
(Setting: QUEEN ANNA's remote chambers. PHILIP enters, his steps measured, his face grim with sorrowful resolve. ANNA looks up; seeing his expression, a flicker of fear, or weary resignation, crosses her features.)
PRINCE PHILIP:
(His voice low but firm, devoid of accusation, only deep sadness)
Mother, the hidden truth at last I've seen,
And know the path where your dark steps have been.
The Sorcerer's tower, and the price you paid,
How for your ease, a kingdom was betrayed.
(QUEEN ANNA bows her head, all artifice falling away. A single tear traces a path down her pale cheek. Her voice is a mere whisper.)
QUEEN ANNA:
My son - my son - your words are sadly true.
My selfish blindness wounded all of you.
The shadow on my heart, I fed its need,
And from that darkness, sowed a bitter seed.
(PHILIP feels no triumph, only a vast, shared grief. They speak for hours, the Queen confessing the hidden fears and vanities that drove her. Understanding, like a fragile dawn, enters the chamber.)
NARRATOR (V.O.):
The Prince then brought this truth into the light,
To share its burden, ending darkest night.
With father, brother, and the new Queen shared,
The fractured trust was carefully repaired.
The Forest vast might never quite recede,
Nor stolen light return by royal creed.
But in their hearts, where shadows used to loom,
A quiet hope found purchase, and found room.
(The light on stage, though still subdued, holds a warmer, more hopeful hue as the play ends.)
(End of Play)
