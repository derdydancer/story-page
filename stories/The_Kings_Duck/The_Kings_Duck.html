var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "Establishes the protagonist, a common archetype (Widow's Son), and his defining characteristic (foolishness), setting up potential for humour and mistakes. Introduces a state of lack (poverty).", "Grimm Style": "Uses a formulaic opening (\"There once lived\"). Simple character description (\"widow's son\"). Functional adjective (\"foolish\"). Establishes social status (\"poor widow\"). Simple sentence structure. Adheres to guide.", "Moral Implication": "Sets the stage for a potential \"Simpleton Succeeds\" narrative, or a cautionary tale about foolishness. Highlights the virtue of enduring poverty.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Widow's Son often represents an underdeveloped **Ego**, lacking strong paternal guidance (King/Father archetype absent). Foolishness signifies na\u00efvet\u00e9 or lack of connection to worldly wisdom/logic, potentially open to instinct or folly. Poverty represents a lack of psychic resources or integration with the world.", "Sentence": "There once lived a poor widow who had a son, and he was known in the village for being quite foolish.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "Provides a specific, humorous example of the son's foolishness, illustrating his nature rather than just stating it. Introduces a mundane task (fetching water) leading to an absurd action.", "Grimm Style": "Simple cause and effect (sent to fetch water -> carries sieve). Uses concrete objects (well, sieve). Focuses on external action. Humour arises from the absurdity of the action, fitting the requested element.", "Moral Implication": "Illustrates the practical consequences of foolishness. Wasted effort. Lack of basic understanding.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The attempt to carry water (life essence, emotion, psychic energy) in a sieve (inadequate container, porous logic/understanding) represents the **Ego's** inability to grasp or manage essential life tasks or psychic content due to its underdeveloped state or flawed thinking. It's inherently futile.", "Sentence": "One day his mother sent him to the well to fetch water, but he took a sieve instead of a bucket.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the inevitable outcome of the foolish action, reinforcing the son's lack of understanding and creating visual humour. Shows interaction with the environment (water flowing away).", "Grimm Style": "Focuses on the action and its immediate result (\"water ran out,\" \"sieve was empty\"). Simple, declarative sentences linked by \"and.\" Matter-of-fact tone describing the failure.", "Moral Implication": "Some tools are simply wrong for the job. Highlights the importance of understanding cause and effect. Reinforces the foolishness.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Demonstrates the **Ego's** continued failure. The life essence (water) cannot be held by the inadequate psychic structure (sieve). The energy dissipates, and the attempt yields nothing (\"sieve was empty\").", "Sentence": "He dipped the sieve into the well again and again, and each time the water ran out before he reached the cottage door, so the sieve was empty.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces an animal element and a potential helper/observer.

Dialogue is simple and points out the obvious flaw. Follows guide on animal helpers/characters.

Sometimes the simplest observation is the most important.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "An instinctual figure (frog, associated with water/transformation/unconscious) observes the **Ego's** futile efforts.

Dialogue expresses his unreasonable anger (\"Hold your tongue, croaker!\"). Simple cause (annoyance) and effect (throwing stone).", "Moral Implication": "Rejecting good advice out of pride or foolishness. Responding to criticism with aggression. Potential harm to those who offer help.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The foolish **Ego**, instead of integrating the wisdom from the instinctual realm (frog), reacts defensively (\"grew vexed\"). It tries to silence or attack the source of the unwelcome truth (throwing a stone). This represents the Ego rejecting unconscious insights or criticisms it finds irritating.", "Sentence": "The widow's son grew vexed at this, and picked up a stone, and threw it at the frog, saying, \"Hold your tongue, croaker!\"", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces consequences for the aggressive action. The stone misses the frog but causes unintended harm, killing a nearby sleeping duck belonging to the King.

He reacts with amusement to the unintended outcome, further highlighting his foolishness and lack of empathy. Sets up his capture.", "Grimm Style": "Describes his reaction directly (\"laughed aloud\"). Dialogue shows his inappropriate amusement (\"Ho ho, I missed the frog but hit the duck!\").

Foolishness bordering on callousness.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The **Ego** reacts to the accidental destruction with inappropriate affect (laughter), showing a profound disconnect from the reality and consequences of its actions.

The capture is swift.", "Grimm Style": "Direct action (\"leapt out,\" \"seized the boy\"). Dialogue states the accusation clearly (\"You wicked boy... killed the king's finest duck!\"). Simple, efficient action leading to capture.", "Moral Implication": "Swift justice or apprehension follows the crime, especially against the King's property. The boy's foolishness leads directly to loss of freedom.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The forces of the conscious order (**Superego**/gamekeeper) apprehend the errant **Ego**.

Establishes the King's character through action, fitting the guide. Simple sentence structure.", "Moral Implication": "Kings have characteristic flaws or preoccupations. This king is focused on wealth. Sets up potential for judgment to be influenced by this trait.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The ruling conscious principle (King/**Ego**) is occupied with managing material or psychic wealth/energy (counting gold). This focus on accumulation might make it rigid or less receptive to other concerns, like the nuance of the boy's foolishness versus malice.", "Sentence": "The king was sitting in his counting house, counting great piles of gold coins.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 11}, {"Plot Function": "The gamekeeper presents the boy and formally accuses him before the King, stating the crime clearly.", "Grimm Style": "Gamekeeper performs his duty (\"brought the boy forward\"). Dialogue is formal address (\"Your Majesty\") and clear accusation (\"This foolish lad has killed your white duck by the well\"). Conveys necessary information efficiently.", "Moral Implication": "Formal accusation process. The crime is clearly stated to the highest authority.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The agent of the **Superego** (gamekeeper) presents the errant **Ego** (boy) and the transgression to the ruling consciousness (King).

The one that laid the tiny golden eggs?\"). Direct question to the accused (\"Is this true?\"). Humour comes from the \"tiny golden eggs\" detail \u2013 exaggerated value. Incorporates humour element.", "Moral Implication": "Authority figures can have misplaced values. Anger can precede full understanding. The accused is given a chance to speak.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The ruling **Ego** (King) reacts with anger (**affect**) to the disruption of its possessions/order. The \"tiny golden eggs\" detail humorously suggests the Ego might inflate the value of certain psychic contents or routines. It demands confirmation from the accused Ego.", "Sentence": "The king grew very wroth, for this was his favourite duck, and he cried, \"My prize duck? The one that laid the tiny golden eggs? Is this true, boy?\"", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 13}, {"Plot Function": "The boy, foolishly honest or simply unable to lie effectively, confirms the act but adds irrelevant and unhelpful details about the frog, minimizing his culpability in a naive way.", "Grimm Style": "Boy's dialogue confirms the main point (\"Yes, lord king\") but adds foolish justification/context (\"but I was aiming for the frog...\"). Simplicity of the confession combined with the foolish excuse is characteristic.", "Moral Implication": "Honesty, even foolish honesty, is shown. However, making excuses or failing to grasp the severity persists. Sometimes telling the *whole* truth isn't wise if parts are irrelevant or self-incriminating in unintended ways.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The accused **Ego** confirms the action but tries to mitigate it by referencing the original intent (silencing the instinctual voice/frog). This shows a lack of understanding of how consciousness judges outcomes, not just intentions, and how it dismisses the relevance of the unconscious trigger (frog).", "Sentence": "The widow's son trembled but answered, \"Yes, lord king, but I was aiming for the frog who called me a ninny, and the duck just got in the way.\"", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 14}, {"Plot Function": "The King dismisses the boy's excuse as irrelevant and immediately pronounces a harsh sentence \u2013 death \u2013 reflecting the severity with which crimes against royal property are treated, but also potentially his own anger or lack of proportionality.

Potential for help emerging from the natural/instinctual world.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The instinctual wisdom figure (frog), although previously attacked by the **Ego**, overhears the harsh judgment of the ruling consciousness (King).

Assumes animals communicate simply. Efficient exposition.", "Moral Implication": "Sharing information and concern leads to potential solutions. Animals working together.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Different aspects of the unconscious/instinctual realm (frog, mouse) communicate and share information about the **Ego's** critical situation.

Cooperation leverages diverse abilities. Taking risks (stealing the key) for a good cause.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The agile, detail-oriented aspect of the unconscious (clever mouse) proposes a solution involving stealth and accessing confined spaces.
