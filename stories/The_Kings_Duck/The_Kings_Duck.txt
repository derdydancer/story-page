The King's Duck
There once lived a poor widow who had a son, and he was known in the village for being quite foolish.One day his mother sent him to the well to fetch water, but he took a sieve instead of a bucket.He dipped the sieve into the well again and again, and each time the water ran out before he reached the cottage door, so the sieve was empty.A great green frog, sitting on a lily pad near the well, saw this and called out, "You ninny, you cannot carry water in a sieve!"The widow's son grew vexed at this, and picked up a stone, and threw it at the frog, saying, "Hold your tongue, croaker!"The stone missed the frog, but flew further and struck a fat white duck that slept by the water's edge, which belonged to the king's own poulterer, and the duck lay stone dead.The widow's son laughed aloud and said, "Ho ho, I missed the frog but hit the duck!"Now, the king's own gamekeeper was hidden nearby amongst the reeds, watching for poachers, and saw all that happened.The gamekeeper leapt out from the reeds and seized the boy by the ear, crying, "You wicked boy, you have killed the king's finest duck!"And he dragged him away towards the palace, to bring him before the king himself.
The king was sitting in his counting house, counting great piles of gold coins.The gamekeeper brought the boy forward and said, "Your Majesty, this foolish lad has killed your white duck by the well with a stone."The king grew very wroth, for this was his favourite duck, and he cried, "My prize duck? The one that laid the tiny golden eggs? Is this true, boy?"The widow's son trembled but answered, "Yes, lord king, but I was aiming for the frog who called me a ninny, and the duck just got in the way.""Aiming for a frog is no excuse!" roared the king, "The duck is dead, and it was mine! You shall hang for this tomorrow at dawn!"Then the king's guards seized the widow's son and locked him away in the darkest dungeon beneath the palace to await the morning.Now, back at the well, the great green frog had heard everything, for his lily pad was close enough to the palace walls, and he thought, "Poor foolish boy, though he threw a stone at me, hanging is a harsh fate for a duck!"So the frog hopped off his lily pad and went to find a clever field mouse he knew, who lived beneath the castle walls.The frog told the mouse how the widow's son was locked in the dungeon and was to hang at dawn, all for killing the king's duck with a stone meant for him.The clever mouse listened closely and squeaked, "This is dreadful! We must get the key from the chief gaoler while he sleeps tonight! I can creep into his pocket."
Now, the chief gaoler was a fat man and lazy, and when night fell, he quickly fell asleep in his chair by the dungeon entrance, and snored loudly.The field mouse crept out from its hole, climbed up the sleeping gaoler's tunic, slipped into his deep pocket, and with much effort, pulled out the heavy iron key.It scurried back to the well, dragging the key which was almost as big as itself, and gave it to the waiting frog.The frog took the key in its mouth, but it was too heavy for him to hop with easily, and he knew they could not turn it in the lock by themselves, so he said, "We need someone strong."He went to the edge of the nearby woods and called softly for an old badger he knew, who had strong paws and was good at digging.The old badger came grumbling out of his sett, listened to the frog's tale, and said, "Hanging for a duck? I mislike kings and their ways, I shall be happy to help trouble them."So the frog, the mouse, and the badger went quietly through the night towards the palace dungeon, the frog carrying the key until it became too tiresome.Then the badger took the heavy key in his strong jaws, and the mouse ran ahead to make sure the way was clear and the gaoler still slept.They reached the dungeon door safely, and the badger put the key in the lock and turned it with a great heave, making a loud click.The heavy door swung open, and the widow's son looked up blinking from the damp straw, and saw the frog, the mouse, and the badger peering in at him.
"Quickly, foolish boy!" croaked the frog urgently, "We have opened the door while the gaoler sleeps, but dawn is coming, and you must flee!""Oh, thank you, brave animals!" said the widow's son, "But I cannot flee far without shoes, and the guards took my worn-out ones when they locked me up."The badger grunted, "Shoes? Nonsense!" and began to dig fiercely with his claws at the earthen floor of the passage, quickly bringing up two lumps of tough root, saying, "Tie these on your feet, they are better than nothing."The boy took the roots and tied them clumsily onto his bare feet with strips torn from his ragged shirt.Then the animals led him quickly through winding passages and out through a secret tunnel under the wall that the mouse knew, and soon they were out in the dark fields beyond the town.There, the frog said, "We must leave you now, boy. Keep to the woods and fields, stay off the king's highway, and perhaps you will live."And so, as the sky began to lighten in the east, the widow's son set off all alone, his feet hurting already in their strange root-shoes.Meanwhile, back at the palace, the fat gaoler awoke with a start, saw the open dungeon door and the empty cell, and raised a great alarm.The king was furious when he heard the news and bellowed, "Escaped? Find him! Send out horsemen and hounds, search every field and wood, I want him brought back, dead or alive!"Soon the sound of galloping horses and baying hounds filled the air as the king's men rode out in all directions, a great hue and cry spreading across the land.
The widow's son was running across a field when he heard the hounds baying not far behind, and knew they hunted him, so he remembered the frog's words and turned towards the darkest part of the nearby wood.He scrambled through thick thorny bushes that tore his clothes, and the clumsy roots on his feet made him stumble often and hurt his toes badly.As he stumbled through a thicket, he almost fell upon a large brown bear which had been disturbed from its nap and growled low in its throat.The widow's son, too flustered perhaps to be properly afraid, stopped and said politely, "Good day, Master Bear, pray forgive my haste, but I am fleeing the king's men who wish to hang me for killing a duck."The bear stopped growling and tilted its great head, looking at the boy with his torn clothes and root-shoes as if puzzled.Just then, the baying of the hounds grew much louder, and three of the king's largest hunting dogs burst into the clearing, spotting the boy and the bear at once.The dogs did not hesitate but flew snarling and biting upon the large brown bear, seeing it as the greater threat or simply following their hunting nature.The bear roared in fury and swatted the first dog aside with a mighty paw, crushed the second in its jaws, and tossed the third high into the air so that it fell down onto the rocks, broken and still.The widow's son stood watching with wide eyes, and when it was over, he said to the panting bear, "Well done, Master Bear, they were horrid noisy dogs, but you have made rather a mess of the king's property again."The bear looked at the boy, then gave him a single light cuff with its paw that sent him tumbling head over heels deep into the bushes, and then it lumbered away into the wood.
The widow's son picked himself up slowly, covered in leaves and twigs, his head spinning from the tumble.He rubbed his bruised shoulder and thought, "Now I am free from the king and his hounds, and also from that rude bear, but I am very hungry and must find something to eat."He looked around and saw bushes with bright red berries and others with shiny black berries, but being foolish, he did not know which were good to eat and which were poisonous, so he thought, "Red ones look juiciest," and began to eat them greedily.He had not eaten more than a handful when his stomach began to ache terribly, his head felt dizzy, and soon he lay groaning on the ground, feeling very ill indeed.A wise old owl sitting in a tree nearby heard his groans and hooted down, "Hoo! You have eaten the slumber-berries! Lucky for you it was not the death-berries that grow nearby.""To help yourself now," said the owl, "you must chew three of these broad, bitter leaves from the plant at my roots."The boy, feeling too ill to argue or be foolish, obediently plucked three bitter leaves and chewed them slowly, though they tasted exceedingly nasty.Very soon he felt much better; the dizziness passed and his stomach settled, and he sat up, weak but recovered."Oh, thank you, wise owl!" he said gratefully, "You have saved me with your knowledge and your bitter leaves."The owl blinked its large eyes and hooted softly, "Hoo. Go now towards the setting sun, and you will find a town. But try not to be quite so foolish in your dealings there."
The widow's son walked towards the setting sun as the owl had directed, and by the next evening, he came to a fine town with high walls.Being hungry again, he looked for work and seeing a baker's shop with loaves cooling in the window, he went in and asked the baker, "Good sir, might I sweep your floor for a crust of bread?"The jolly baker, who liked a jest, laughed and said, "Aye, lad, you may sweep, but my broom is broken. Take this goose tied to a stick instead, sweep all the flour dust into the corner, and mind you don't let the goose eat it!"The widow's son took the strange broom and tried to sweep, but the goose flapped its wings and honked loudly and kept trying to peck at the flour dust on the floor, making the task very difficult.Now, it happened that the king's daughter of that town was passing the baker's shop in her little pony-cart, and she looked in and saw the boy struggling to sweep the floor with the flapping goose.The princess burst out laughing, for she had never seen such a comical sight, and her laughter was like little bells, causing the widow's son to look up and see her pretty face.He was so struck by her beauty that he forgot all about his sweeping and the baker's warning, and let go of the stick for a moment.The goose instantly fluttered onto the baker's counter and began to gobble up three of the baker's finest iced cakes meant for the mayor's tea party.The baker came running from the back room, red with anger, shouting, "Look what you've done, useless boy! Those cakes were for the mayor! I shall dock your non-existent pay and give you a beating!"But the princess quickly stepped in and said to the baker, "Do not scold him, good baker. It was my fault for distracting him with my laughter. Here are three gold pieces for the cakes, which is surely more than they were worth."
The baker's anger vanished at the sight of the gold, and he bowed low, taking the coins greedily, so the widow's son was spared the beating.The princess then smiled at the boy and said, "You seem a poor hand with a goose-broom. We happen to need a gardener's boy at the palace gardens; perhaps that work would suit you better?""Oh yes, princess! Thank you!" cried the widow's son, greatly delighted, "Sweeping with roots or geese is hard work indeed! I would gladly take the garden work."So the widow's son went to work in the royal gardens, and he worked diligently, planting flowers and trimming hedges, and keeping the paths tidy.The princess would often walk there amongst the flowers, and she would watch him work and sometimes speak kindly to him about the plants.One year, however, a strange blight fell upon the princess's favourite white rosebush; its leaves withered, its buds blackened, and the princess was greatly distressed, for the wisest gardeners could not cure it.The widow's son saw the sad bush and saw the princess's tears, and he thought, "Perhaps I can help, for I have had dealings with wise creatures of the wood and field."That night, when all slept, he crept out of the palace grounds and journeyed back through the darkness towards the well near his mother's abandoned cottage, intending to fetch water from that special place.When he reached the well, the great green frog was sitting there as if waiting, and it croaked, "Hah, the foolish boy returns! This water holds life, but use it wisely: only three drops upon the rose's roots, exactly at moonrise."
He waited anxiously for the next moonrise, and then crept unseen to the withered rosebush and carefully applied exactly three drops of the well-water to its roots in the silvery light.At once, a change began; the withered leaves unfurled green and healthy, the blackened buds swelled and opened, and by morning the bush stood tall and proud, covered in the loveliest white roses imaginable.When the princess came into the garden that morning and saw her beloved rosebush restored to such beauty, she cried out with joy and asked her attendants, "Who has done this wonderful thing?"No one knew, but another gardener, who was perhaps jealous of the widow's son's diligence, stepped forward and said, "Princess, I saw the new gardener's boy lurking near the bush under the moon last night."The princess sent for the widow's son at once, and looking at him kindly, she asked, "Was it you who healed my rosebush?"The widow's son blushed but stood tall and answered truthfully, "Yes, princess. I fetched water in the night from a special well I know, and did as a wise frog instructed me."The princess was greatly pleased by his honesty and the miracle he had performed, and said, "You are more than a simple gardener's boy!" and she went straight to her father the king, and told him everything, praising the boy's wisdom and resourcefulness.The king of that town, who was a good and thoughtful man, was much impressed by the tale and sent for the widow's son, wishing to reward him.Just then, a travel-stained messenger arrived from the boy's own country, bearing news that the old king there had died suddenly of indigestion from eating too many tiny golden eggs, and that the gamekeeper had confessed the boy likely hit the duck by pure accident.Hearing all this, the good king declared, "This young man seems both wise and virtuous, despite his foolish start! He shall marry my daughter, for she is clearly fond of him, and as I have no son, he shall one day inherit my kingdom!"
And so there was a grand and joyful wedding feast, and all the people saw that the widow's son was no longer foolish, but carried himself with modesty and wisdom.He sent for his old mother, who came to live in comfort at the palace for the rest of her days, quite bewildered by her son's good fortune.He and the princess lived very happily together, and she often laughed retelling the story of how she first saw him sweeping with a goose.His kingdom prospered, for although he had great riches, he used them wisely for the good of his people, unlike the king who prized tiny golden eggs above justice.And so they lived long and happily, respected by all in their prosperous kingdom.And if they have not died, they are living there still.
