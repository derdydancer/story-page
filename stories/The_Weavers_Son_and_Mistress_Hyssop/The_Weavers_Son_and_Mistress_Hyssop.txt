The Weaver's Son and Mistress Hyssop
There was once a poor weaver who had one son.
The son had learned the craft of weaving well from his father.
It chanced one day that the weaver went to speak with the Queen.
And to make himself seem of some account, he told the Queen that his son could weave sunlight into cloth.
The Queen said to the weaver, "That is a skill I should like to see; if your son is as deft as you claim, bring him to the palace to-morrow, that I may put it to the test."
When the weaver's son was brought before her, the Queen led him to an empty room with a large loom, and said, "Now, take your place, and if by sunrise you have not woven cloth from sunlight, you shall be in servitude to the crown for all your days."
Then she herself barred the door from the outside and left him there alone.
And so the poor weaver's son sat before the loom, and knew not how to begin, for no thread of sunlight came to his hand, and his spirit sank low within him.
Then, on a sudden, the door unbarred itself, and in came an old woman, small and bent, who said, "Greetings, young weaver; why do you sit so forlorn before an empty loom?"
"Alas, good mother," answered the young man, "I am bid to weave sunlight into cloth by morning, or face a lifetime of servitude, and I know not how such a thing might be done."
Then the old woman said, "I can do this thing for you, but what will you give me as payment, an I weave this cloth of sunlight by sunrise?"
"I have little to my name," said the weaver's son, "but I will give you this sturdy belt from my waist; it is all I have with me of any worth."
The old woman took the belt, then went to the window where the first rays of dawn touched the sill; she seemed to draw forth threads of pure dawn light, and by the time the sun was fully risen, her shuttle had moved swift as thought, and upon the loom lay a bolt of cloth that shone like the sun itself.
When the Queen came at sunrise and saw the shining cloth, she was greatly amazed and pleased, and said, "A marvel indeed, young weaver; such skill must not be idle henceforth."
She had the weaver's son taken to another chamber, with a larger loom still, and told him that as he valued his freedom, he must by the next sunrise weave a tapestry from moonlight, one that shows true dreams.
The young man despaired, for he knew no way to capture moonlight on a shuttle, but soon the door unbarred itself once more, and the old woman stood there, asking, "And what will be my wage for this night's work, weaver's son?"
"Good mother," he said, "I have already given you my belt; I can only offer you these good boots from my feet, though they have served me faithfully on many a road."
The old woman took the boots, and as the moon climbed high, she gathered its beams like silvern threads, and dreams seemed to flow from her fingers into the loom, so that by morning a tapestry that shimmered with visions hung there complete.
The Queen was rejoiced beyond telling at the sight of the dream-tapestry, and her eyes shone with a new desire; she said, "One more task, and you shall be my chief counsel and weaver of wonders: weave for me a cloak from the fabric of silence itself, that it may render the wearer unheard by any ear."
When the old woman appeared that night in the third chamber, which was grander than all before, the weaver's son said to her, "Wise mother, I have nothing left to offer you for such a weaving, for you have my belt and my boots, and I own naught else of worth."
"Since you have no gold nor gear," said the old woman, "then you shall promise me your name, that which you are called; and it shall be mine if you cannot tell me my own true name three years from this night, when I come to claim it."
"Three years is a long time," thought the weaver's son, "and who can say what may happen? Perchance she will forget, or I shall learn her name." So, in his great need and seeing the high station promised, he gave his promise, and the old woman then wove silence itself into a cloak that absorbed all sound around it.
And when in the morning the Queen came and touched the cloak, and found it utterly soundless, she marveled greatly, and true to her word, she made the weaver's son her chief counsel in the kingdom.
Wellnigh three years went by, and the weaver's son served the Queen wisely with his counsel, and he thought no more of the old woman nor his promise, for his life was full and important.
But on the very day the three years were ended, as he sat in council with the Queen, the old woman suddenly stood before him in the chamber and said, "Young man, I have come for that which you promised me: your name."
The Queen's counsel was sore afraid, and offered the old woman all the wealth he had gained, or his lifelong service in any other form, if she would but let him keep his name; but the old woman said, "Nay, a name is a name, and that was our bond."
Then the young man pleaded with such despair in his voice that the old woman had a moment's pity and said, "Then I shall give you this chance: you have three nights to tell me my true name."
"If at the end of that time you know it, you may keep your own; but if you do not, then your name is mine, as we agreed."
Then the Queen's counsel spent that whole day in great anxiety, and sent messengers to every corner of the land, and commanded scribes to list all female names recorded or remembered, from the grandest to the most humble.
And when the old woman came that first night, he read to her from a long scroll, beginning with Agnes, Bertha, Clothilde, and many hundreds more, but after each one, the old woman merely shook her head and said, "That is not my name."
On the second day, the Queen's counsel bade his messengers seek out the most outlandish and forgotten names that old crones in distant villages might recall, or that were hinted at in crumbling texts.
So when the old woman returned on the second night, he put to her names such as Spittlefig, Grizzelkin, and Thistlewick, and others that made the very guards by the door snicker, but to each she replied calmly, "A curious name, but not mine; still you have not found it."
On the third day, the Queen's counsel felt his hope was nearly gone, so he dismissed his messengers and scribes, and as dusk fell, he himself went out from the palace and into the deep woods beyond the city, alone and on foot.
He wandered for many hours, weary from his search, until he came to a hidden clearing in the deepest part of woods, and there he saw a tiny hut of woven branches, and before it, a small, flickering fire.
And round the fire skipped the very same old woman who had visited him, performing a strange little dance by herself, and she sang in a high, reedy voice:
"My pot it does bubble, my spindle does twirl,"
"I weave by the moonlight, alone in my world;"
"Tomorrow I'll claim the King's Counsel's fine name,"
"And none know I'm called Mistress Hyssop, good game! Hee! Hee!"
The Queen's counsel, hearing this, felt his heart near leaped from his chest with sudden joy; he crept away quietly from the clearing and made haste back to the palace before the dawn.
When the old woman came to the palace on the third night, she had a sharp look in her eye and a small, knowing smile, and she said, "Well, young master of counsel, this is the final hour; what is my name?"
The weaver's son looked at her thoughtfully, as if puzzling greatly, and said first, "Are you perhaps called Goody Prudence?"
"Prudence is a virtue I possess, but it is not my name," she answered, and chuckled a dry little laugh.
"Then," said the young man, tapping his chin, "could your name be Mother Willow-Wisdom?"
"I dwell near willows and may have some wisdom, yet that too is not what I am called," she said, her smile tightening a little. "Speak what you truly think, if you have any guess at all."
Then a true smile touched his lips for the first time that night, and he said clearly, "Then perhaps your name is Mistress Hyssop?"
At this, the old woman shrieked a terrible shriek, and her eyes burned like coals as she cried, "Some dark magic has aided you, or a bird of the air told my secret!"
Then she stamped her foot upon the stone floor, and vanished in a puff of bitter herbs and dust, and was never seen in that palace again.
And so the weaver's son kept his name and his high counsel, and he continued to serve the Queen long and well with the wisdom his strange journeys had brought him.
And as for the magical weavings, they were kept as treasures of the realm, though none since could say how such wonders were ever truly made.
