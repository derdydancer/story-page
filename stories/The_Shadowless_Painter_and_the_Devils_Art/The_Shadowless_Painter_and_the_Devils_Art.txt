The Shadowless Painter and the Devil's Art
There was once a scholar's son who journeyed to the chief city of the southern lands to learn the art of limning, but for all his toil, he could not master it at the great academy. His masters at the academy said to him after a year, 'Your hand is clumsy and your eye sees amiss; this craft is not for you.' So the scholar's son took his leave of the city, with naught but his poor brushes and meager paints in a satchel upon his back. He walked for many days, and knew not whither he went, finding scant food and little shelter beneath the trees. At length he came to a dark forest, and at a place where two paths crossed, he sat down upon a stone to rest. As he sat there, a man in the garb of a plain traveler came up to him and said, 'Hark ye, young master, why such a doleful air?' The scholar's son replied, 'Good sir, I sought to learn the trade of limning, but my hands are fit for naught, and now I wander, a burden to myself.' The traveler smiled, though his eyes did not, and said, 'Perhaps I can teach you another sort of art, one that needs no brush, nor keen eye, but only a willing spirit.' The scholar's son looked up and asked, 'And what art might that be, prithee?' The traveler replied, 'It is the art of persuasion, to make men see what is not, and believe what is false; I ask only in return a trifle, one small thing you possess, yet know not its true worth.'
The scholar's son, thinking of his empty purse and failed hopes, said, 'If I possess such a thing, it is yours, for having naught, I can lose naught of consequence.' 'It is merely your shadow that frisks behind you in the sun,' said the traveler, 'A fleeting thing, of no true use.' The scholar's son laughed, thinking it a droll price, and said, 'Then take it freely, for a shadow buys no bread, nor warms a man in winter.' Upon this, the traveler stooped, and with a deft movement, seemed to peel the scholar's son's shadow from the ground, rolled it up like a piece of dark cloth, and tucked it into his own satchel. The scholar's son blinked, and felt himself all over, but found he was no lighter, nor felt any different than before. Then the traveler touched the youth's tongue with a finger as cold as ice and said, 'Now go forth; your words will be as paint, to make the foul fair and the false true in the ears of men.' Before the scholar's son could thank him or ask more, the traveler was gone, having melted into the twilight of the forest like smoke. The scholar's son continued on his way and soon met some woodcutters, to whom he declared that the moon was made of green cheese and that he himself had dined there. The woodcutters marveled at his words and, believing him to be a great sage, gave him a share of their coarse bread and cheese. The scholar's son ate with relish and thought to himself that this was an easier trade by far than toiling with brush and color.
So he went from village to village, weaving tales both wondrous and false, and because of the traveler's gift, his falsehoods seemed truth to all who heard them, and he wanted for neither food nor shelter. Word spread of the scholar's son, and folks called him the Man of Strange Eloquence, and they flocked to hear him speak in the market places. He found he could praise a mean man into a hero, or slander a good wife with but a few chosen words, and sometimes he would set neighbor against neighbor merely for a jest or a small coin. Yet, he noticed that dogs would whine and bristle when he passed, and cats would slink away from him with flattened ears, which he found puzzling. One day he came to a prosperous town where the mayor, having heard tales of this man of great account, sent for him. The mayor, a stout and worried man, said, 'Sir Eloquence, we have a bitter dispute in our town between the weavers and the dyers that no reason can settle; lend us your art of speech and bring concord.' The scholar's son bowed and replied, 'Esteemed mayor, it is but a small matter for one such as I to turn men's hearts this way or that.' He then spoke to the weavers and the dyers in the town square for an hour, and such was his art that he made black seem white and wrong seem right, until both sides cheered his wisdom and swore to be friends. The mayor was greatly pleased and gave the scholar's son a purse full of silver coins and a new cloak of good wool. As he was leaving the town, a little child playing by the gate pointed at him and cried, 'Mother, look! That man has no shadow following him!'
The mother hushed the child, saying, 'Be still, silly one, the sun plays tricks with our eyes,' and the scholar's son hurried on his way, a little less at ease. From that day, he became more careful to walk abroad mostly in cloudy weather or by the light of dusk and dawn, when shadows are long or ill-defined. His fame spread further, and soon he was summoned by a nobleman with great lands who had heard of his skill in settling disputes with words. The nobleman told him, 'My daughter, who is fair and my only heir, refuses all suitors; I wish you to persuade her to accept a certain lord, rich and powerful, though somewhat old and ill-favored.' The scholar's son, seeing a path to greater favor and riches, bowed low and said he had little doubt he could bend the maiden's will to her father's. He was brought then before the nobleman's daughter, who was indeed fair but had a clear, steadfast spirit in her eyes. The scholar's son spoke for a long hour, praising the old lord's supposed wisdom in his years, the strength in his position, and the gentle kindness that lay hidden beneath a gruff exterior. The maiden listened patiently, and when he was done, she said calmly, 'Your words are honeyed, sir, but they hide a bitter truth, and I will not be swayed by them.' The scholar's son was much taken aback, for never before had his art failed him so utterly against a simple maiden. He had to confess his failure to the nobleman, who stormed and raged not at the scholar's son, but at his daughter's unyielding will.
Nevertheless, the nobleman kept the scholar's son in his household, for he saw that such a tongue could be useful in other matters of persuasion with his rivals and tenants. The scholar's son lived well enough on the nobleman's estate, with good food and fine clothes, yet the child's words and the fear of beasts often returned to his mind. One day, riding on some business for the nobleman, a thick mist descended in an unfamiliar stretch of forest, and he lost his way entirely. After wandering for hours, he stumbled upon a small hut of rough stones, from which emerged an old hermit with a long white beard. The hermit looked at him with keen eyes and said, 'It is a strange thing, young sir, to travel without your shadow to keep you company.' The scholar's son started greatly and stammered, 'Old father, how know you this, when even I forget it at times?' 'Some things are plain to see for those who look with more than just their eyes,' the hermit replied gently. 'And a man without his shadow is not whole, nor is he entirely of this world or the next.' The hermit then said, 'If you wish to become whole again, there is a path, though it involves three tasks, each more hard and perilous than the last.' The scholar's son, feeling a chill that had naught to do with the mist, bowed his head and said, 'For such a prize, I will attempt whatever you bid me.' 'First, then,' said the hermit, 'you must go to the old mill by the black stream, and spend one night within its walls, from dusk until cock-crow, a place where many have entered but none have seen the dawn again.'
The scholar's son, though his courage faltered within him, nodded to the hermit and set out to find this mill by the black stream. He found it at last as twilight fell, a ruined and forbidding place with the groaning of its timbers and the rushing of dark water beneath its decaying wheel. He stepped inside, finding it empty save for dust and shadows, and sat upon a broken stool in the main chamber to wait for what might come. As midnight struck from a distant church tower, an icy wind swept through the mill, and a low moaning sound arose, before which a tall, shrouded figure glided from the darkest corner. The scholar's son, though fear clutched at him, recalled the art that the traveler had taught him, and began to speak to the figure with smooth and calming words. He told it of the futility of lingering in sorrow, of the peace that awaited beyond, and of the needless disturbance it caused to the living. The shrouded figure paused in its advance, seemed to consider his words, and then with a sigh that sounded like dry leaves skittering, it faded away into the darkness whence it came. Twice more that night, other spirits of more terrible aspect appeared, one like a great snarling beast with fiery eyes, and another like a weeping woman dragging chains, but each he soothed and turned away with the same art. When the cock crowed at last, the scholar's son found he was unharmed, having passed the night solely by his strange gift of speech. He returned to the hermit's hut in the light of morning, and the old man looked at him and said, 'I see the mill holds you no longer.'
'For your second task,' said the hermit, 'you must climb the great glass mountain that lies to the north, and from the griffon that nests on its peak, you must pluck a single golden feather.' The scholar's son's heart sank, for he had heard tales of that mountain, and he asked, 'But old father, how can mortal feet climb sheer glass, or what words can soothe a griffon?' The hermit smiled and gave him three small, dry nuts, saying, 'The mountain does not yield to common strength, nor the griffon to common speech; these nuts are from a tree unseen by most, use them wisely when your need is greatest.' The scholar's son took the three nuts, thanked the hermit once more, and began the long and weary journey to the far north. After many weeks, he beheld it at last, a mountain that rose like a sheer cliff of ice into the clouds, offering no hold for hand or foot. He walked all about its base but found no path, and when he tried to climb, his feet slipped instantly; in despair, he sat down and recalled the hermit's nuts, and taking one, he cracked it open. Inside he found not a kernel, but a pair of tiny crampons of gold, so small he could hold them both on his fingertip; as he looked at them, they flew to his boots and fastened themselves to the soles, their points gripping the glass like flies' feet. Amazed, the scholar's son stood up and found he could now walk up the sheer surface of the glass mountain as if it were but a gentle slope. He climbed for many hours, and at last reached the summit, where he found a great nest of sticks and bones, but the griffon itself was not there, though a single golden feather lay gleaming amidst the twigs. He quickly snatched the feather, but at that very moment, a great shadow fell over him, and the griffon, larger than any horse, landed on the edge of the nest with a screech that split the air.
Its eyes were like burning coals, and its beak of polished bronze, and it spoke in a voice like thunder, 'Mortal, how dare you steal what is mine?' The scholar's son, with his heart leaping like a frightened frog, bowed very low and began to speak with all the false sweetness and cunning he possessed. He praised its noble form, the glory of its flight, the unmatched splendor of its golden plumage, and declared he meant only to take the fallen feather as a humble token to inspire artists in the lowly world below. The great griffon listened with a strange sadness in its burning eyes and then said, 'Your tongue is smoother than any I have heard from mortal kind, a gift of shadows, I perceive.' 'Know this, speaker of glib falsehoods,' the griffon continued, its voice echoing, 'there is an ancient law that binds even my kind: to one who bears the mark and speaks with the liar's gloss given by the Master of Shadows, we must grant a single boon, though it grieves us.' The scholar's son was dumbfounded, understanding little of this talk of laws and masters, only that the creature before him was not trying to tear him limb from limb. 'And you bear that mark clearly, boy,' the griffon rumbled, its gaze fixed on the ground where no shadow lay, 'for your emptiness where your true shadow should take root is plain for any with ancient sight to see.' 'Therefore, speak your desire, and be swift, for this is a bitter draft for me to drink, and your presence with that borrowed tongue is a blight upon this sacred peak.' The scholar's son, his head spinning, could think only of the hermit's task and his own peril, so he stammered, 'I ask only for this single golden feather, which I already hold, and for safe passage down this treacherous mountain.' The griffon inclined its great head slowly. 'The feather is yours by your quick snatching, and safe passage you shall have, but know that any boon granted thus, through the Master's shadow-play, comes ever twisted: this feather will grant you the skill in limning you once craved, and men will marvel at your work, but your works will carry no heart, and reflect only the emptiness you sought to fill.'
Then, before the scholar's son could speak, the griffon took him gently in its great talons, spread its mighty wings, and bore him swiftly down from the glass mountain, setting him unharmed at its foot. He clutched the golden feather, and as he looked about him, the trees, the stones, the very air seemed to resolve themselves into lines and forms with a clarity he had never known before, yet without warmth or life. When he came again to the hermit's hut, the old man looked not at the feather but into the youth's eyes and said, 'You have the bauble that will bring you fame, and the skill to make men wonder, but I see your own heart will be a desert for it.' 'The second task is done, after a fashion,' the hermit sighed, 'For the third, you must return to the world and, with this new craft, create one single work, not for fame, nor for silver, but purely from a selfless love for another being; then, perhaps, your shadow may be restored.' The scholar's son left the hermit, his mind a whirl of great skill and great sorrow, to seek a subject for such a work. He journeyed back to the great cities, and his paintings were marvels of exactness, of light and form, though they held no warmth; kings and merchants paid him fortunes, and all praised him as the greatest master of the age. Yet in all this glory, the scholar's son found no joy, for he saw the hollowness in his own masterful works, heard the child's cry in his dreams, and often felt the chill of his missing shadow even in the warmest rooms. He tried to paint a suffering beggar with compassion, a laughing child with delight, or a dying flower with sorrow, but each work, though flawless, was cold as the traveler's touch, and he knew he could not break the curse upon his art. Years passed, and he grew old, rich, and lauded throughout the lands, but he remained alone, accursed in his own soul, for his shadow never returned. And as he lay dying, surrounded by his lifeless masterpieces, he understood at last the true worth of a simple shadow, and wept for the art that had no heart to give.
When he was dead, people marveled for a short season at his grand house and his many paintings, but soon enough the works gathered dust in attics, or were sold for trifles to cover newer walls. But one small painting, a clumsy and ill-formed picture of a stray dog he had tried to render in his student days, full of uneven strokes yet with a spark of honest feeling, was found by a simple serving maid in a forgotten chest. She knew nothing of art, nor of the great master the painter had become, but she saw a kindness in the dog's painted eyes and a longing in its tilted head that touched her. She took it to her little room and hung it by her bedside, and often it gave her a small comfort in her weary life. And the traveler with eyes that did not smile, he who had taken the shadow, merely chuckled to himself as he walked the world's roads, ever seeking other ambitious souls who deemed their shadows but trifles. The old hermit in the forest still dwelt in his hut of stones, tending his small garden, and gazing at the stars with eyes that had seen many such sad comedies unfold. The griffon on the glass mountain still guarded its peak, and sometimes, it is said, would utter a mournful cry when the wind carried the scent of a shadowless man with a liar's tongue, sadly fulfilling the bitter law. And so, while the scholar's son's name as a master limner faded from memory like mist, the little painting of the clumsy dog with the kind eyes was passed from mother to daughter for many generations, cherished for a reason none could quite name but all could feel. For it is the way of the Master of Shadows to grant the letter of a wish, but to steal its spirit, leaving naught but a hollow triumph and emptiness at its core. And the simple serving maid's great-granddaughter, and the old hermit, and the griffon, and the traveler with the cold touch, they may be living still, if they have not died.
