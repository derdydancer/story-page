var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "Introduces the protagonist (duke), the initial conflict (loss of lands due to betrayal), and sets the stage for his flight and hardship.", "Grimm Style": "Starts with 'There was once a...', a classic Grimm opening. The treacherous cousin is a common villain archetype. Loss of status is a frequent starting point. Language is relatively simple. The 'treacherous cousin' is a clear villain. The theft of lands is a typical inciting incident.", "Moral Implication": "Betrayal leads to loss and suffering. Illustrates the precariousness of power and fortune.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Represents a fall from grace, a loss of identity or rightful place. The 'stolen lands' can symbolize lost potential or disinheritance from one's true self. The 'treacherous cousin' could symbolize a shadow aspect or a betraying internal complex.", "Sentence": "There was once a duke whose lands were stolen by a treacherous cousin.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "Explains the duke's motivation for fleeing (fear for life), his state of poverty (disguise, plain clothes), and introduces a crucial symbolic object (the Midnight Bloom seed) that he saves.", "Grimm Style": "Flight and disguise are common motifs. Taking a single, seemingly small but significant item is typical. The magical nature of the flower ('rarest', 'opened only under the full moon') fits the magical element of Grimm tales. 'Plain clothes' highlights fallen status.", "Moral Implication": "In dire circumstances, one holds onto what is most precious, which may not be material wealth but something of deeper value (hope, heritage, unique skill/possession). Prudence in the face of danger.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'disguise' is the adoption of a persona for survival. The 'single seed' symbolizes hope, resilience, the core of one's identity or unique gift that is preserved despite loss. The 'Midnight Bloom' suggests a connection to the unconscious, the hidden, or the cyclical nature of life (moon).", "Sentence": "Fearing for his life, the duke fled in disguise, taking nothing but the plain clothes on his back and a single seed from the rarest flower in his castle garden, the Midnight Bloom, which opened only under the full moon.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the duke's journey to safety and his decision to seek humble employment, setting up his new, concealed identity.", "Grimm Style": "Travelling 'far until he came to a kingdom where he was unknown' is a standard trope for new beginnings. Seeking 'honest work' highlights virtue despite hardship. 'Gardener at the king\u2019s palace' is a common humble profession for disguised nobles in fairy tales (e.g., Iron Hans, Cat-Skin).", "Moral Implication": "The dignity of honest labor, even for one of high birth. Humility in adversity. Resourcefulness in starting anew.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The journey to an 'unknown kingdom' represents a descent into the unconscious or a new phase of life where past identity is shed. Taking on a humble role (gardener) symbolizes a period of introversion, cultivating inner resources, or connecting with the 'earth' of one's being.", "Sentence": "He travelled far until he came to a kingdom where he was unknown, and seeking honest work, he offered his services as a gardener at the king\u2019s palace.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "Explains how the duke secured his position, emphasizing his inherent skill despite his disguise.", "Grimm Style": "Being 'skilled' is a common attribute that allows a disguised hero to find a place. 'Under-gardener' reinforces his humble new station. The reason for hiring is practical and direct.", "Moral Implication": "True skill and worth can be recognized even in humble circumstances. Competence is valued.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Inherent abilities ('skilled with plants') cannot be entirely suppressed by external circumstances. The 'under-gardener' role suggests working at a foundational level, perhaps learning new aspects of the self or the world from a different perspective.", "Sentence": "Because he was skilled with plants, he was taken on as an under-gardener.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 4}, {"Plot Function": "Characterizes the duke's behavior in his new role, emphasizing his discretion, diligence, and secrecy.", "Grimm Style": "Speaking 'little' and working 'diligently' are virtuous traits in Grimm heroes. Keeping 'his past a secret' is crucial for the hidden identity trope. The sentence structure is simple and direct.", "Moral Implication": "The virtues of discretion, hard work, and patience. The necessity of maintaining a secret when vulnerable.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "This behavior reflects a period of necessary withdrawal and containment. 'Spoke little' could mean an internal focus, and 'worked diligently' shows commitment to the current, albeit reduced, reality. The 'secret past' is the unacknowledged or suppressed true Self.", "Sentence": "He spoke little, worked diligently, and kept his past a secret.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "Shows the duke acting on the hope he carried with him, planting the seed. This action sets up a key future plot element.", "Grimm Style": "A 'hidden corner' is a typical place for something special or magical to be nurtured. Planting the 'single seed' is an act of faith and continuation of his heritage. The action is direct and purposeful.", "Moral Implication": "Nurturing hope even in secret and difficult times. The importance of preserving and cultivating one's unique gifts or heritage.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Planting the seed in a 'hidden corner' symbolizes nurturing a deep, personal potential or a connection to one's true self in a private, protected inner space. It's an investment in future restoration or blooming.", "Sentence": "In a hidden corner of the royal gardens, he planted the single seed he carried.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 6}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the result of the duke's efforts: a unique plant that is initially unremarkable (no flowers), creating anticipation.", "Grimm Style": "'Tended it carefully' shows diligence. A 'strange and beautiful plant' fits magical flora. The lack of flowers initially provides a small obstacle or mystery. The phrasing 'unlike any other' emphasizes its special nature.", "Moral Implication": "Patience and care are needed for special things to grow. Not all value is immediately apparent. Perseverance in the face of delayed results.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The plant represents the slow, often unseen, development of inner potential. Its initial lack of flowers could symbolize a period of latency or that conditions are not yet right for full expression. Its uniqueness suggests the singular nature of individual destiny.", "Sentence": "He tended it carefully, and in time, a strange and beautiful plant grew, unlike any other in the gardens, but it bore no flowers.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 7}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces minor antagonists (other gardeners) and their mockery, highlighting the duke's perseverance and the plant's misunderstood nature.", "Grimm Style": "Mockery by ordinary, unenlightened figures is common for a hero or special object. 'Useless weed' is a typical dismissal of something whose true value is not yet known. The hero 'persisted,' showing virtuous resolve.", "Moral Implication": "Staying true to one's convictions despite ridicule or misunderstanding from others. The value of perseverance when one knows the deeper worth of something.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'other gardeners' can represent societal skepticism, internal doubts, or those who only value the conventional. The 'useless weed' label shows how true potential can be misjudged by superficial observation. Persistence is the ego's commitment to an inner vision.", "Sentence": "The other gardeners mocked him for tending a useless weed, but he persisted.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 8}, {"Plot Function": "Marks a specific, magically significant time (full moon) and the duke's action of visiting his plant, building towards the flower's reveal.", "Grimm Style": "The 'full moon' is a classic time for magical events. Identifying the duke as 'Johan the gardener' reinforces his disguised identity. Visiting the 'hidden plant' at night adds to the mystique.", "Moral Implication": "The importance of timing and auspicious conditions for certain events or revelations. Attending to what one values, even in secret.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'full moon' symbolizes a peak of psychic energy or readiness for the unconscious to reveal something. The dual naming ('duke (now known only as Johan)') highlights the tension between his true self and his persona. The journey to the plant is a journey to a sacred, hidden aspect of the self.", "Sentence": "One night, under the bright light of the full moon, the duke (now known only as Johan the gardener) went to his hidden plant.", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 9}, {"Plot Function": "The magical event occurs: the flower blooms under the moonlight, fulfilling the seed's promise.", "Grimm Style": "The direct cause-and-effect of moonlight triggering the bloom is characteristic of fairy tale magic. 'Unfurled its petals' is a simple, evocative description of a magical transformation.", "Moral Implication": "Patience and perseverance are rewarded. Special things reveal their beauty at the right moment and under the right conditions.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The blooming represents the culmination of a hidden growth process, the emergence of a repressed or nurtured potential into consciousness. Moonlight as the catalyst suggests the role of intuition, the feminine principle, or the unconscious in bringing forth this beauty.", "Sentence": "As the moonlight struck it, a single, large flower unfurled its petals.", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 10}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the magical appearance and scent of the Midnight Bloom, emphasizing its unique and wondrous qualities.", "Grimm Style": "The description uses simple but powerful contrasts ('darker than night, yet shimmered with captured starlight') typical of Grimm. 'Wondrous scent' is a common attribute of magical flowers. The description isn't overly ornate.", "Moral Implication": "True beauty can be found in unexpected or mysterious forms. Some wonders are reserved for special conditions (night, moonlight).", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The flower's appearance ('darker than night,' 'captured starlight') symbolizes the beauty that can emerge from darkness or the unconscious, a treasure of the 'night world.' Its 'wondrous scent' could represent an intuitive knowing or a spiritual influence.", "Sentence": "It was darker than night, yet seemed to shimmer with captured starlight, and its scent was wondrous.", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 11}, {"Plot Function": "Confirms the identity of the flower, a moment of fulfillment for the duke's efforts.", "Grimm Style": "Simple, declarative statement. The naming signifies its importance and connection to the duke's past.", "Moral Implication": "The recognition of true worth. The fulfillment of a long-held hope.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The naming is an act of recognition and confirmation. The Midnight Bloom, now revealed, represents the manifest form of the preserved heritage and potential.", "Sentence": "It was the Midnight Bloom.", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 12}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces a new character (the princess) and her problem (sad dreams, joylessness), setting her up as someone who might be helped by the flower.", "Grimm Style": "A king's daughter with a mysterious ailment is a classic fairy tale setup. 'Troubled by sad dreams' and 'could find no joy' are simple descriptions of her state. This sets up a 'lack' that needs to be fulfilled.", "Moral Implication": "Even royalty can suffer from inner turmoil that material wealth cannot solve. Points to problems of the soul or mind.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The princess represents a soul in distress, perhaps an Anima figure (if the duke is the central focus) that is suffering. Her inability to find joy in the 'daylight world' suggests a disconnect from conscious life, possibly due to repressed unconscious content ('sad dreams').", "Sentence": "Now, the king of this land had a daughter who was troubled by sad dreams, and could find no joy in the daylight world.", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 13}, {"Plot Function": "Emphasizes the severity of the princess's condition by stating the failure of conventional help.", "Grimm Style": "'Doctors and wise men could do nothing' is a common trope to show that the problem requires a magical or unconventional solution. This elevates the significance of any potential cure.", "Moral Implication": "Some afflictions are beyond ordinary remedies and require something special or magical. The limits of conventional wisdom.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The failure of 'doctors and wise men' (representing conventional knowledge and rational approaches) indicates that the princess's problem is of a deeper, perhaps spiritual or psychological nature, requiring a solution from the realm of the symbolic or unconscious (like the Midnight Bloom).", "Sentence": "Doctors and wise men could do nothing for her.", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 14}, {"Plot Function": "Moves the princess towards the magical flower, creating the opportunity for her healing encounter.", "Grimm Style": "'That night' links it to the flower's blooming. Wandering 'sleeplessly into the gardens' is a common way for characters to encounter magic or pivotal events. Simple action driving the plot.", "Moral Implication": "Restlessness or suffering can sometimes lead one to unexpected sources of help or discovery.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Sleeplessness implies an agitated unconscious. Wandering into the garden at night suggests a movement towards the unconscious, seeking something unknown that might bring solace. It's an unconscious pull towards healing.", "Sentence": "That night, the princess wandered sleeplessly into the gardens.", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 15}, {"Plot Function": "The princess discovers Johan and the Midnight Bloom, the pivotal meeting that will change her fate.", "Grimm Style": "Being 'drawn by the strange, beautiful scent' is a classic fairy tale mechanism for magical attraction. The image of Johan 'kneeling beside the Midnight Bloom' presents him in a humble, almost reverent posture with the magical object.", "Moral Implication": "Intuition or sensory experiences (like a scent) can guide one to what is needed. Important encounters can happen unexpectedly.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The scent acts as an unconscious guide, pulling the Anima figure (princess) towards the source of healing (flower) and the disguised hero (duke). Johan's kneeling posture suggests a respectful relationship with the numinous or precious.", "Sentence": "Drawn by the strange, beautiful scent, she came upon Johan kneeling beside the Midnight Bloom.", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 16}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the princess's perception of the flower, emphasizing its unique and magical qualities.", "Grimm Style": "The flower being 'unlike any she had ever beheld' reinforces its specialness. 'Seeming to drink the moonlight' is a simple, poetic image fitting the style. Focuses on visual impact and magical aura.", "Moral Implication": "The power of unique beauty to captivate and awe. Recognizing the extraordinary.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The flower 'drinking the moonlight' symbolizes its direct connection to the unconscious, feminine, or intuitive realm. The princess's perception of it marks the beginning of her connection to this healing power.", "Sentence": "She saw the flower, unlike any she had ever beheld, seeming to drink the moonlight.", "Chapter Number": 5, "Sentence Number": 17}, {"Plot Function": "The magical healing occurs: gazing at the flower lifts the princess's sadness and brings peace.", "Grimm Style": "The healing is direct and magical, a common feature. 'Sadness lifted from her heart' and 'felt a sense of peace' describe the effect simply. This is slightly more explicit about internal feeling than some Grimm tales but still within acceptable bounds for effect.", "Moral Implication": "Beauty and nature (especially magical nature) can have profound healing effects on the human spirit. Peace can be found in unexpected places.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The flower acts as a symbol of integrated unconscious beauty and peace. Gazing upon it allows the princess to connect with this quality, healing her inner turmoil. It's a moment of psychic integration or solace.", "Sentence": "As she gazed upon it, the sadness lifted from her heart, and she felt a sense of peace she had not known before.", "Chapter Number": 5, "Sentence Number": 18}, {"Plot Function": "The princess initiates dialogue, seeking to understand the source of her healing. This moves the interaction forward.", "Grimm Style": "A direct question from royalty to a commoner. 'Whispered' suggests the quiet, magical atmosphere of the night and the garden. Simple dialogue tag.", "Moral Implication": "Curiosity and the desire to understand sources of good. Openness to engage with those of different stations when something profound is experienced.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The question signifies a conscious inquiry into the nature of the healing experience. It's the beginning of a relationship between the princess (suffering Anima) and the gardener (disguised Self/Animus).", "Sentence": "\u2018Gardener,\u2019 she whispered, \u2018what is this flower?\u2019", "Chapter Number": 5, "Sentence Number": 19}, {"Plot Function": "Johan names the flower for the princess, sharing its identity.", "Grimm Style": "Direct answer. 'Replied quietly' matches his established character and the hushed setting. Addressing her as 'Princess' maintains respect for station despite the informal setting.", "Moral Implication": "Sharing knowledge simply and truthfully. The power of naming.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Johan acts as the gentle guide, naming the source of peace. His quiet reply reinforces his role as a humble, wise guardian of this natural magic.", "Sentence": "\u2018It is the Midnight Bloom, Princess,\u2019 Johan replied quietly.", "Chapter Number": 6, "Sentence Number": 20}, {"Plot Function": "Johan explains the flower's nature and the condition for experiencing its peace, adding a layer of wisdom to his character.", "Grimm Style": "This sentence has a slightly more philosophical or poetic tone than typical Grimm dialogue but frames it as the flower's nature ('It shares its peace...'). The conditions ('only with the moon,' 'hearts open to the quiet of the night') are fitting for a magical element.", "Moral Implication": "Peace and special insights are available to those who are attuned to them (open hearts, appreciation for quiet/night). Some gifts are conditional or require a certain disposition.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "This implies that connection with the healing aspects of the unconscious (moon, night) requires receptivity ('open hearts') and an ability to appreciate subtlety ('quiet'). It\u2019s a gentle instruction on how to connect with deeper psychic realities.", "Sentence": "\u2018It shares its peace only with the moon, and with those whose hearts are open to the quiet of the night.\u2019", "Chapter Number": 6, "Sentence Number": 21}, {"Plot Function": "Establishes a recurring pattern of the princess finding solace with the flower and Johan, allowing their relationship to develop.", "Grimm Style": "Repetition of an event ('every night of the full moon') is a Grimm characteristic. Johan 'watching over her' is a protective, gentle role. 'Finding solace' reinforces the flower's healing power. The language is fairly direct.", "Moral Implication": "The healing power of ritual and consistent connection with sources of peace. The quiet comfort of companionship.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The recurring visits create a safe space for healing and the gradual development of a relationship between the princess (Anima) and Johan (disguised Animus/Self). The full moon signifies a cyclical return to this potent time for inner work.", "Sentence": "From then on, every night of the full moon, the princess would come to the garden, and Johan would watch over her as she sat near the Midnight Bloom, finding solace in its presence.", "Chapter Number": 7, "Sentence Number": 22}, {"Plot Function": "Shows the development of the relationship between the princess and Johan, based on his inner qualities rather than his station.", "Grimm Style": "This sentence shows more character depth and emotional nuance ('depth and gentleness,' 'belied his humble station') than is typical for very early Grimm tales, but it is still presented relatively simply. It's a 'Hidden Identity' trope where true worth shines through.", "Moral Implication": "True character and inner worth are more important than outward status. Looking beyond appearances to see the person within.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The princess begins to perceive Johan's true nature ('depth and gentleness') despite his humble disguise ('persona'). This is the Anima recognizing the true qualities of the Animus/Self, fostering a deeper connection.", "Sentence": "She began to speak with the quiet gardener, finding a depth and gentleness in him that belied his humble station.", "Chapter Number": 7, "Sentence Number": 23}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces external agents (ambassadors) from Johan's past, bringing news that will trigger the revelation of his identity.", "Grimm Style": "Arrival of messengers from a distant land with news is a common plot device. The link to 'the land that had once belonged to Johan' immediately signals a turning point.", "Moral Implication": "The past eventually catches up. The turning of fortune's wheel.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The ambassadors represent the return of the repressed past or the call to reclaim one's true identity and destiny. They are external catalysts for an internal process of revelation that has been building.", "Sentence": "One day, ambassadors arrived from a neighbouring land \u2013 the land that had once belonged to Johan.", "Chapter Number": 8, "Sentence Number": 24}, {"Plot Function": "Delivers crucial information: the usurper is dead, and Johan is wanted back, setting the stage for his restoration.", "Grimm Style": "The death of the villain (treacherous cousin) 'without heir' conveniently resolves one conflict and creates an opening. The people 'cried out for the return of their true duke,' a common trope expressing loyalty to the rightful ruler. The direct reporting of news is typical.", "Moral Implication": "Injustice may not last forever; the rightful order seeks to reassert itself. The will of the people can call for justice and restoration.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The death of the 'treacherous cousin' can symbolize the overcoming or demise of a negative complex or the shadow aspect that caused the initial 'theft' of the Self's rightful place. The people's cry is the psyche's longing for wholeness and the return of the true Self to its leading role.", "Sentence": "They brought news that the treacherous cousin who had usurped the dukedom had died without heir, and the people cried out for the return of their true duke, though none knew where he had fled.", "Chapter Number": 8, "Sentence Number": 25}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces the key object for identification: the portrait.", "Grimm Style": "A portrait or other identifying object is a classic means of revealing a hidden identity. This is a simple, concrete plot device.", "Moral Implication": "Truth can be preserved and revealed through tangible records or symbols. Identity, though obscured, can be rediscovered.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'portrait' symbolizes the true image of the Self, preserved despite the current disguise or fallen state. It is an objective representation that can break through the persona.", "Sentence": "The ambassadors carried with them a portrait of the missing duke.", "Chapter Number": 8, "Sentence Number": 26}, {"Plot Function": "Sets the scene for the public revelation: the king's court with the princess present.", "Grimm Style": "The royal court is a typical setting for important announcements or judgments. The princess's presence is key, as she holds a piece of the puzzle. Simple description of the scene.", "Moral Implication": "Important truths are often revealed in formal or public settings where their significance can be acknowledged.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The court represents a formal, conscious setting where truths are brought to light.
