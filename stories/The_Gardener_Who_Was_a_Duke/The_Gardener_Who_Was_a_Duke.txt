The Gardener Who Was a Duke
There was once a duke whose lands were stolen by a treacherous cousin. Fearing for his life, the duke fled in disguise, taking nothing but the plain clothes on his back and a single seed from the rarest flower in his castle garden, the Midnight Bloom, which opened only under the full moon. He travelled far until he came to a kingdom where he was unknown, and seeking honest work, he offered his services as a gardener at the king’s palace.
Because he was skilled with plants, he was taken on as an under-gardener. He spoke little, worked diligently, and kept his past a secret. In a hidden corner of the royal gardens, he planted the single seed he carried. He tended it carefully, and in time, a strange and beautiful plant grew, unlike any other in the gardens, but it bore no flowers. The other gardeners mocked him for tending a useless weed, but he persisted.
One night, under the bright light of the full moon, the duke (now known only as Johan the gardener) went to his hidden plant. As the moonlight struck it, a single, large flower unfurled its petals. It was darker than night, yet seemed to shimmer with captured starlight, and its scent was wondrous. It was the Midnight Bloom.
Now, the king of this land had a daughter who was troubled by sad dreams, and could find no joy in the daylight world. Doctors and wise men could do nothing for her. That night, the princess wandered sleeplessly into the gardens. Drawn by the strange, beautiful scent, she came upon Johan kneeling beside the Midnight Bloom.
She saw the flower, unlike any she had ever beheld, seeming to drink the moonlight. As she gazed upon it, the sadness lifted from her heart, and she felt a sense of peace she had not known before. ‘Gardener,’ she whispered, ‘what is this flower?’
‘It is the Midnight Bloom, Princess,’ Johan replied quietly. ‘It shares its peace only with the moon, and with those whose hearts are open to the quiet of the night.’
From then on, every night of the full moon, the princess would come to the garden, and Johan would watch over her as she sat near the Midnight Bloom, finding solace in its presence. She began to speak with the quiet gardener, finding a depth and gentleness in him that belied his humble station.
One day, ambassadors arrived from a neighbouring land – the land that had once belonged to Johan. They brought news that the treacherous cousin who had usurped the dukedom had died without heir, and the people cried out for the return of their true duke, though none knew where he had fled. The ambassadors carried with them a portrait of the missing duke.
The king received them in court, and the princess stood beside him. When the portrait was unveiled, the princess gasped. She looked from the portrait to the quiet gardener who tended the grounds, and whom she had seen kneeling by the magical flower. The resemblance was unmistakable, though the gardener was older and marked by sun and soil.
‘Father,’ she said, ‘this is no mere gardener. This is the lost duke!’
All eyes turned to Johan, who stood silently at the back of the hall, having come to deliver some herbs to the cook. He met the princess’s gaze, and knew his disguise was at an end. He stepped forward and bowed. ‘Princess,’ he said, ‘your eyes see truly. I am that duke, or was.’
The king was astonished. He questioned Johan, who told his story truthfully. The ambassadors rejoiced to have found their duke. The king, seeing the look that passed between his daughter and the duke, and knowing how the gardener had brought her the only peace she had known, said, ‘It seems fate brought you here for more than tending flowers. You have served humbly and well, and won my daughter’s regard, not as a duke but as a man. If she is willing, you shall marry her, and unite our kingdoms when you return to claim your own.’
The princess readily agreed. Johan, revealed as the duke, married the princess. He returned to his own land, acclaimed by his people, with his bride beside him.
