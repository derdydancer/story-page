The Inn upon the North Moor
There was once a poor woodcutter and his wife who had a little son, and this son would say naught but one strange word, over and over. Many a time did his father and mother ask him what he meant, or bade him speak other words, but still he spoke only that one. And the word he spoke was 'Redrum,' a sound that made the leaves tremble when he was near. At last the woodcutter said to his wife, 'I will take the boy to the wise woman who dwells by the old mill, perhaps she can tell us what ails him.' So the next morning, the woodcutter took his son by the hand, and they set out and walked for three days, over rough paths and through a dark forest. On the evening of the third day, they came to the old mill, and saw the little hut beside it where the wise woman dwelt. The woodcutter knocked, and the wise woman opened the door, and he told her of his son, and the one word he would always say. The wise woman looked at the boy for a long time, then she said, 'Take him to the great stone Inn that stands alone on the North Moor, and see what you shall see.' The woodcutter did not understand, but he thanked her, and the very next day, he and his son set out once more to find this Inn. For seven days they walked over a bleak and windswept moor, and at last they saw before them a great and forbidding stone Inn, with no other house in sight.
As they drew nearer, they saw that there was no smoke from its chimney, and its windows were dark like empty eyes, and the great door was shut fast. The woodcutter knocked loudly on the oak door with his staff, but no sound came from within, so he knocked again, even louder. At last, the door creaked open of its own accord, and an old man, thin and pale, stood there looking at them with eyes that held no welcome. The woodcutter said, 'Good sir, my son and I have travelled far, and seek only shelter for the night and a little food.' The old man looked at the boy, who clutched his father's hand and said nothing but 'Redrum' softly, then he replied in a voice like rustling leaves, 'You may enter, but be warned, this Inn keeps few guests, and they keep to themselves and are not like other folk.' He led them into a great hall that was cold as a winter's night and thick with dust, and no fire burned in the great hearth. The old man gave them a little hard bread and thin soup, then led them up a creaking staircase to a small and damp room, saying, 'Sleep well, and pay no mind to any sounds you may hear,' and then he was gone. The woodcutter tried to make a brave face for his son, but the boy only whispered 'Redrum' and stared at the cobwebs in the corner. As the night grew deeper, the woodcutter and his son began to hear faint scrapings and soft moans that seemed to come from the walls themselves or the floor below. The woodcutter held his son close and said naught, though the boy now repeated 'Redrum, Redrum,' louder now, his eyes wide in the gloom.
When daylight came, the woodcutter sought out the old man and asked him concerning the sounds of the night. The old man merely shrugged and said, 'It is but the wind in the eaves, or rats in the cellar, best not to trouble your head with it,' though his eyes darted towards a dark stain on the floorboards near the hearth. The woodcutter felt a disquiet in his heart, but remembered the wise woman's words, and so resolved to stay another day at the Inn. That day, he saw that the great taproom was all but deserted; cobwebs hung like shrouds from the rafters, and the tables and benches were empty, covered in a thick layer of dust, and an unnatural silence filled the air. While the woodcutter was mending his worn boot by the cold hearth, the boy, still whispering 'Redrum,' wandered away from him, down a dark passage towards a heavy door that seemed to lead to a cellar, as if drawn by an unseen thread. The boy pushed at the heavy door with his small hands, and it creaked open, revealing steep, dark steps leading down into blackness. The woodcutter looked up from his work and saw his son was gone; he rose in alarm and called his name, but no answer came. He searched the taproom and the passages, and then he spied the open cellar door, and from the blackness below, he heard his son's voice, faintly repeating, 'Redrum, Redrum.' The woodcutter's heart was heavy with dread, but he made his way carefully down the steep steps, into a place that was cold and damp, and that smelled of stale earth and something else, something sweet and rotten. By the faint light of a single tallow candle the boy must have found, the woodcutter saw his son standing quite still before a row of great barrels, and from the taps of three of them, a thick, dark stream of blood trickled forth and pooled upon the stone floor.
The woodcutter cried out in horror and snatched his son's arm, saying, 'Come away, child! This is no place for us!', and turned to flee up the stairs. But as they reached the top of the cellar steps, the old innkeeper stood there, as if he had risen from the shadows themselves, blocking their way with his frail body and a smile that was thin and cold. 'Leaving so soon?' the old man said, his voice no louder than a whisper. 'Few guests leave this Inn once they have truly seen its heart.' The woodcutter tried to push past him, but the old man, for all his frail appearance, had a strength that belied his years, and held him fast. 'No, no,' the innkeeper said, still smiling. 'You will stay in the Master's Suite, upstairs. It has been waiting.' And he gestured towards another, wider staircase. With no choice, the woodcutter followed him up this staircase to a great door carved with strange figures and a tarnished brass handle, which the old man unlocked with a heavy iron key that groaned in the lock. Inside, the room was large and had once been fine, with a great canopied bed and carved furniture, but all was now thick with dust, and a cloying, sweetish scent, like old, dried flowers, filled the air. The innkeeper bade them enter, and as soon as they were inside, he pulled the door shut, and they heard the heavy key turn in the lock on the outside. The woodcutter looked about the room; the windows were barred with thick iron, and the chimney was too narrow for a man to climb, and an air of ancient sorrow hung over everything. His son, however, paid no heed to the bars, but pointed a small finger towards a tall shape covered by a heavy, dust-laden cloth in the far corner, and said, 'Redrum,' quite insistently now.
The woodcutter, seeing naught else to do, went to the corner and pulled away the heavy cloth, revealing a tall, ornate portrait of a woman with a stern and sorrowful face, whose painted eyes seemed to follow them about the room. Three days passed in this manner; meagre food was left silently outside their locked door each morning, and sometimes they would see the old innkeeper watching them through a small spyhole, his eyes gleaming in the dark, but he never spoke. The woodcutter, with naught to do but stare at the dust and the sorrowful portrait, began to pace the room and mutter to himself, and then, after a time, to speak to the portrait as if the woman might answer. His son, meanwhile, sat in a corner, rocking back and forth, his 'Redrum' now a ceaseless, soft chant that his father could not seem to break through, nor could he reach him with comforting words. One evening, as the woodcutter paced in the dim light from the barred window, his boot struck against a loose floorboard beneath the great, dusty rug. With a sudden hope, sharp and painful, he knelt and pulled back the rug, then using his knife, he pried at the board until it came loose, revealing a small, hollow space beneath. Within this space, his trembling fingers found a little bundle of letters, yellowed with age and tied with a faded silk ribbon. With a surge of hope that he might find some clue to their predicament or the Inn's nature, he untied the ribbon and opened the first letter, his eyes scanning the brittle paper in the gloom. He saw, with a chill creeping into his blood, that it contained only one sentence, written over and over again, in a cramped, spidery hand: 'All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy,' it said, and it filled the entire page, and the next, and the next. The woodcutter dropped the letters as if they burned him, but his son, who had crept near, picked one up and began to trace the spidery script with a small finger, his own strange word falling silent for a moment.
On the seventh day of their confinement in the dusty suite, the air grew colder still, and the cloying scent of dried flowers became stronger and more sickening. As dusk fell, a faint shimmer appeared in the air near the sorrowful woman's likeness on the wall, and this shimmer slowly began to coalesce into a dim, wavering shape. The shape solidified, and the woodcutter and his son saw before them the very woman from the portrait, but her gown was tattered and stained, her face sunken and her visible skin like old parchment, stretched tight over bone. She raised a skeletal hand and spoke, her voice like the rustle of grave-clothes, 'You seek release, woodcutter, but desire binds all who linger here in this room of sighs.' The woodcutter stepped back, his hand to his mouth, and could scarce draw breath to ask, 'Who... what are you?' The decaying woman gave a ghastly smile that cracked the parchment of her lips, and pointed a long, bony finger towards the great canopied bed in the center of the room. Though every fiber of his being screamed to flee, the woodcutter found his feet moving, step by slow step, towards the bed, as if his feet were not his own. He reached out a trembling hand and pulled back the dusty velvet coverlet, to find not a sleeping form, but a skeleton, clad in the decaying remnants of a fine silk gown, its bony jaws fixed in a silent, ghastly grin, its empty sockets staring upwards. As the woodcutter stared, the ghostly apparition of the woman by the portrait flickered, gave a faint sigh that stirred the cobwebs, and then faded like mist in the morning sun. At this, something within the woodcutter snapped, and he began to laugh, a strange, cackling laugh, even as tears streamed down his face from his wide, unseeing eyes.
His laughter echoing in the dead, still room, the woodcutter looked about, his eyes burning with a wild light, and then he spied a woodsman's axe propped in a dark corner, perhaps left by some former, ill-fated guest. He seized the axe, its handle fitting his grip with a terrible familiarity, and with wordless cries, he raised it high and began to smite the heavy oak door that barred their way. The boy cowered in the corner, his eyes fixed on his father, who was now a terrifying stranger, and 'Redrum, Redrum, Redrum' was his only reply to the crashing blows. Again and again the axe fell, until the sturdy oak groaned and splintered, and at last, with a great crash, a jagged hole was rent in the door near the lock. The woodcutter dropped the axe for a moment, panting, and peered through the hole, and there, standing patiently in the dark corridor beyond, was the old innkeeper, his face unchanged. A terrible grin stretched the woodcutter's lips, and thrusting his wild-eyed face through the jagged opening, he roared, no longer at the innkeeper, but towards his own small son cowering within the room, 'Here is the woodcutter for you, boy!' Then, all was white and cold, and the boy found himself running, stumbling through a vast, snow-covered hedge maze, the dark walls of the Inn far behind him, yet he heard the crashing of an axe still echoing. He turned this way and that, but every path he took through the tall, dark hedges led him only to a wall of icy thorns, or back to the same cursed spot he had just left. His small limbs grew heavy with cold and exhaustion, his breath was a white cloud in the freezing air, and at last, he could run no more, and fell into a drift of snow. As he lay there, shivering, a tall figure in the immaculate dress of a butler stepped from the hedge as if it were a doorway, not a speck of snow upon him, and looked down at the boy with empty eyes.
'Lost, little master?' the butler said, his voice soft and without inflection. 'But one is never truly lost here. You have always been the boy in the snow, sir.' Then the butler beckoned with a white-gloved hand, and with unerring steps, he led the boy through twists and turns that had baffled him before, until the dark shape of the Inn loomed again before them through the falling snow. The old innkeeper was standing by the now-mended great oak door, and he and the butler exchanged a brief, knowing look as the boy was ushered back inside. 'The North Moor is a lonely place,' the innkeeper said, his voice smoother now, almost kind, 'and this house stands on cursed soil, where a great wrong was done long ago, and the echoes of that wrong still cry out from the very stones.' He then led the boy, not to the Master's Suite, but down another corridor into a long gallery, hung with many portraits, old and new, their faces dim in the dusty light filtering from high, arched windows. The innkeeper gestured to a canvas at the very end of the gallery, seemingly newly hung, and said, 'Every soul finds its place here, in time.' The boy looked, and saw his own face staring back at him from the painted surface, a little older perhaps, dressed in fine clothes at some grand ball he had never attended. 'Your father too has found his place among us,' the old man continued, a faint smile playing on his lips. 'He serves the Inn now, as all do, in their own way.' The boy looked from his painted likeness to the innkeeper, and for the first time since he had learned to speak, he uttered a new word, his voice a mere breath: 'Home.' The old innkeeper nodded slowly, a faint, dry rustle that might have been a chuckle escaping his lips. 'Indeed, sir. Welcome.' And so the boy stood before his own painted face in the long, silent gallery of the great stone Inn, a small, still figure in a place where time itself seemed to have become ensnared, and the dust motes danced in the single shaft of light from a high, grimy window.
As for the woodcutter, he was now a gaunt sentinel with an axe, his eyes holding no memory of his son, only a dull fire, and he paced the dark corridor leading to the Master's Suite. Sometimes, he would stop his pacing and begin chopping rhythmically at the air where a door once stood, or perhaps where one might one day be, the thud of his phantom blows echoing faintly. From time to time, new, weary travelers, lost on the North Moor, would see the Inn's forbidding shape as a promise of refuge and knock upon its great oak door. It was always the old man who answered, thin and pale, his eyes holding no welcome, yet he would always bid them enter. And these travelers, none were ever seen to leave the Inn again, though sometimes a new portrait would appear in the long gallery, its subject’s eyes always with a hint of sorrow or a silent scream. The great stone Inn itself seemed to draw sustenance from the sorrow and despair that soaked into its ancient walls, its grey stones growing a little darker with each passing year. The ghostly butler, too, would sometimes be seen moving silently through the halls, perhaps dusting a forgotten statue, or bringing a small, untouched tray of food to the boy who now rarely moved from before his own portrait. The boy himself spoke no word at all now, not 'Redrum,' not 'Home,' but only stared, and in his young eyes was the same dim, trapped light he saw in the painted faces that lined the gallery walls. And on the North Moor, vast and empty beneath a cold grey sky, the great stone Inn stands still, and the wind cries around its eaves, as it always had, and as it always would. Within its walls, there is only silence, save for the faint, rhythmic thud of an unseen axe, and the silent gaze of a painted boy who was, and is, and will always be, looking at himself.
Others still come to the North Moor, and see the Inn, and seek its shelter, knowing naught of the woodcutter or his child, nor of the welcome that truly awaits them. The old innkeeper is always there to greet them, his pale face and empty eyes the first and last true sight of the Inn's hospitality. And slowly, almost unseen, the long gallery within grows by one more sorrowful face, one more story that ached silently from the canvas. The woodcutter's axe still falls in the dark corridor, its echo a faint, ceaseless rhythm, a heartbeat for the house itself, though what it chops is never seen. The boy before the portrait never moves, never speaks, but only watches the paint dry on a likeness too true, and 'Redrum' is but an echo in a chamber of his own young mind. Down in the cellar, the dark pools of blood that seeped from the ancient barrels never dry, but remain ever wet, like a dark spring that wells from the cursed earth below. The ghostly butler continues his rounds, his movements precise and timeless, for as he sometimes whispers to the empty chairs, he has always been the caretaker, and always will be. Outside, the snow-covered hedge maze still stands, its icy thorns gleaming, ready to confound the lost who wander too near or seek to flee the Inn's shadow on the moor. And in the Master's Suite, the mad letters filled with one endlessly repeated phrase lie still scattered where the woodcutter dropped them, a testament to a mind long since unravelled, slowly turning to dust with the rest of the forgotten room. Thus, the Inn upon the North Moor endures, with its dust, its silence, and its ever-growing collection of sorrows, and waits.
