The Magic Sword
There was once a king who ruled a peaceful kingdom. But beyond the mountains dwelt a mighty dragon, which every year demanded a fair maiden from the kingdom as tribute. There was great sorrow in the land whenever the time came, for the dragon was fierce, and no knight had been able to slay it. Now, in the capital city, there dwelt a poor tailor. He was not known for bravery, but often boasted he could sew a button onto a pudding without breaking the skin. One year, the lot was to be drawn near the time of the princess's eighteenth birthday, and many feared it would fall upon her. The king, full of dread, proclaimed that whoever slew the dragon would receive a mountain of gold and marry his daughter, the princess. Many knights heard the call, but remembering the fate of others, none dared step forward. The tailor, however, heard the proclamation and thought, "A mountain of gold is better than buttons, perhaps I shall try my luck." So he took his great sewing needle, his thimble, and his sharpest shears, and set off towards the mountains where the dragon dwelt.
He travelled for three days and three nights, and came at last to the edge of a dark forest that lay before the dragon's mountains. As he rested beneath an oak, out popped a tiny grey mouse onto his boot, which squeaked, "Turn back, tailor bold, or answer me this riddle told!" "I have an eye but cannot see, I help join things, what can I be?" The tailor chuckled and replied, "That is simple for one such as I; it is a sewing needle, like the one I carry nearby!" "Right you are!" squeaked the mouse, "And for your wit, you shall have this," and from a hole beneath the oak root, it dragged out a sword hilt, though the blade was quite hid. "This is no common sword," the mouse explained, "but a blade of great magic; whisper the name of any beast, and into that shape it will twist." "Moreover, in beastly form, it can spy on any scene, far or near, just by thinking of where it would be, unseen." The tailor took the hilt, which now showed a gleaming blade, thanked the mouse kindly, and felt a little braver indeed. He thought for a moment, then whispered "Sparrow!" and the sword vanished, and a little brown sparrow zipped past his ear, chirping merrily. Whispering "Sword!" brought it back to his hand, so he tucked it in his belt and went on his way into the forest toward the high mountains.
After passing through the forest, he came to the mountains, where the land was burnt black and bones littered the ground. "Best to spy first," thought the tailor, remembering the mouse's words about the sword's power. He held the hilt, whispered "Fly!" and instantly the sword became a tiny black fly buzzing in the air. He thought hard of the dragon's lair high in the peaks, and the fly zipped away, unseen by any eye. Soon the tailor knew what the fly saw: a great green dragon fast asleep upon enormous piles of gold and jewels in a vast cave. The fly circled closer and saw that beneath the dragon's left foreleg, there was one small patch where the scales were soft and pale, unlike the hard green hide elsewhere. Having seen enough, the tailor thought of his hand, and the fly vanished as the sword reappeared in his grasp. "Aha," said the tailor to himself, "Direct fighting is for knights; a tailor must use his needle!" He then spent the rest of the day gathering the strongest thread he could find in the forest, a vial of sleeping draught bought from a travelling herbalist he met, and a pot of sweet honey. When night fell, he crept silently up the mountain path towards the dragon's cave.
He smeared the honey near the cave entrance, mixed the sleeping draught into it, and waited hidden behind a rock. Soon, the dragon stirred, sniffed the air, crawled out, greedily licked up all the sweet honey, and then fell back inside the cave into a slumber far deeper than before. Seeing his chance, the tailor crept into the cave and, using his strongest thread, began to sew shut the soft patch of scales beneath the sleeping dragon's leg with tiny, tight stitches. His nimble fingers flew, making the seam so neat and tying the strongest knots, just as if he were finishing a king's fine coat. When he had finished his work, sewing the patch completely closed, he crept away swiftly and hid himself again outside the cave. At dawn, the great dragon awoke, stretched its mighty limbs, and seemed to notice nothing amiss. It yawned wide, intending to breathe a plume of morning fire, but only a sad little puff of smoke came out, followed by a weak cough. The dragon shook its head in confusion, tried again, producing only another smoky burp, and looked quite bewildered. Then the tailor boldly stepped out from behind his rock and called, "Mighty dragon, did a fly tickle your throat last night?" The dragon gave a sorrowful wheeze, turned its great tail, and lumbered slowly back into its cave, too ashamed or too weak to face the little tailor.
The tailor, seeing the beast vanquished by his wits, turned back towards the kingdom to claim his reward. He marched straight to the king's hall, still dusty from the mountains, and declared, "Your Majesty, the dragon will trouble your kingdom no more!" The king and his court stared, then burst into laughter, for how could a simple tailor achieve what mighty warriors could not? "Laugh if you will," said the tailor calmly, "but my sword here can show you the truth; let it become a falcon and spy upon the beast!" The king nodded, and the tailor whispered "Falcon!"; the sword shifted into a fierce hunting bird which soared instantly towards the mountains. In moments it returned, hovering before the throne, and all present could somehow see within its sharp eyes the image of the great dragon huddled miserably in its cave, coughing smoke. Amazement filled the hall, and the laughter died at once; the tailor had indeed done what he claimed. The king, astonished but true to his word, ordered a great pile of gold, as large as a small mountain, to be given to the tailor at once. "You have earned the gold," said the king, "but as for the princess, well, she is used to finer folk than tailors; perhaps another service to the kingdom is needed first." The tailor bowed, had the gold carted away (though he scarce knew what to do with it), and replied, "Another service? Name it, Your Majesty, and my needle is ready!"
"Very well," said the king, somewhat surprised by the tailor's readiness, "It seems my chief jailer has been acting strangely of late; prisoners whisper of unseen watchers and stolen rations. Go to my dungeon and discover the truth of this matter." The tailor agreed at once, glad for another chance to prove his worth, and went towards the deep stone dungeons beneath the palace. Thinking stealth was needed once more, he drew his sword in a dark corner and whispered, "Rat!" The sword became a sleek grey rat with twitching whiskers, which scurried off into the damp shadows between the cells. It soon saw the stout King's Jailer not tending his duties, but huddled in a storage cellar with a tall, dark figure who had horns half-hidden beneath a hood and a pointed tail twitching beneath his cloak - it was the Devil himself! The rat's sharp ears heard the Devil promise the Jailer great power and riches in exchange for the despair of the prisoners, whose meagre hopes the Jailer would steal each night. The Devil then gave the Jailer three tiny, spiteful imps made of shadow, who could slip through keyholes to whisper nightmares and snatch crusts of bread, unseen by mortal eyes.
The tailor called the sword back to his hand, its rat-form dissolving into gleaming steel, now knowing the secret of the dungeon's sorrow. He did not go straight to the king, but instead went boldly to the Jailer's own office, where the stout man sat counting keys. "Good day, Jailer," said the tailor, "Have your three little shadow friends been busy stealing hope from the king's prisoners lately, by order of your horned master?" The Jailer dropped his keys with a clang; his face went pale as death, then red with rage, and he drew a heavy cudgel from beneath his desk. "No one learns my secrets!" roared the Jailer, swinging the cudgel hard at the tailor's head. But the tailor was quicker; he whispered "Snake!" and the sword became a long green snake that coiled instantly around the Jailer's arm, making him drop the cudgel. The Jailer howled in terror as the snake tightened its grip, its cold scales against his skin, unable to move a muscle. Just then, the three shadow imps slipped under the door to report to their master, but the tailor hissed "Cat!", and the sword became a swift black cat that pounced and caught the squeaking imps in its claws. The cat swallowed the shadows whole, gave a satisfied purr, and then turned back into the gleaming sword at the tailor's command. The tailor then bound the trembling Jailer with his own keys and belt, and marched him up to the King's hall. Before the astonished court, the tailor told of the Jailer's wicked pact with the Devil and the torment of the prisoners by the shadow imps, now safely dealt with. The King, pale with anger at the betrayal, declared, "This Jailer who dealt in despair shall know it himself! Lock him in the deepest, darkest cell, with only shadows for company and spiders for bread!" Then turning to the tailor, the King announced, "For this great service, tailor, I grant you the title of Baron and the richest farmlands in the southern plains!"
The tailor bowed low, now Baron Tailor, though the fine title felt as strange as the gold had. Peace returned for a season, but the King remained troubled, saying, "Baron Tailor, you are brave and clever, but the Devil still walks free who tempted my Jailer; can you rid my kingdom of his shadow forever?" The tailor felt a shiver, for dealing with a dragon or a jailer was one thing, but the Devil himself was another matter entirely. He drew his sword privately and asked it, "Wise blade, how does one trick the Father of Lies?" The sword shimmered, and showed the tailor an image not of the Devil's power, but of him preening before a dark mirror, immensely proud of his cunning and his fine black cloak. "So," thought the tailor, "Pride comes before a fall, even for the Devil. I shall challenge him to a contest he cannot resist." He went down again to the now-empty storage cellar beneath the dungeons, scattered a circle of salt for protection, and called out, "Devil, I know you can hear me! I wager my new title and lands that I am more cunning than you!" A puff of brimstone smoke erupted, and the Devil stood before him, sneering, "A mortal baron thinks himself cunning? Very well, little tailor, what is your foolish wager?" "A simple test of skill," said the tailor, holding up his needle and thread. "Let us see who can sew this button," he held up a tiny pearl button, "onto this sunbeam," he pointed to a shaft of light slanting through a high cellar window. The Devil threw back his head and roared with laughter, "Sew on a sunbeam? Fool! Agreeed! If you win, I leave this kingdom forever. If I win, your soul is mine! Now watch the master!"
The Devil snatched the button and thread, flew to the sunbeam, and tried with all his dark magic to fix the button, but his claws passed right through the light, and his curses only made the dust motes dance. After much fuming and swearing, the Devil threw the button down in disgust and snarled, "Impossible! Now let us see your tailor's trick, mortal!" The tailor picked up the pearl button, threaded his needle, and stood so the sunbeam shone precisely through the needle's eye; then, quick as a wink, he sewed the button firmly onto his own waistcoat. "There," declared the tailor, holding up his waistcoat, "I have sewn the button *onto* something *with* the sunbeam involved, just as we wagered! You failed utterly." The Devil howled with rage, seeing he had been tricked by the mortal's simple wit, stamped his foot so hard it cracked the cellar floor, but knew he was beaten by the terms of the wager. "You win this time, tailor!" he spat, "But we shall meet again!" and vanished in a cloud of foul-smelling smoke, leaving the kingdom free of his presence.
The tailor, dusting himself off, went back to the King and reported that the Devil himself had been outwitted and banished from the land forever. The King could scarcely believe his ears; first the dragon, then the corrupt jailer, and now the Devil himself defeated by a simple tailor! "Baron Tailor," the King declared, his voice full of respect, "You have saved my kingdom thrice over! I name you my Chief Advisor and grant you chests overflowing with jewels!" "And you have more than earned the hand of my daughter, the princess; the wedding shall be prepared!" Soon the whole kingdom was busy with preparations for the royal wedding, and there was great rejoicing everywhere. The tailor, dressed now in fine silks (though he kept his magic sword hidden nearby), stood beside the princess, who smiled upon him kindly. But as the wedding feast began, word came that the wicked Jailer, driven mad by the shadows and spiders, had somehow broken free from his cell. Indeed, at that moment, the Jailer himself, ragged and raving, burst into the hall brandishing a rusty iron bar he had pried loose. He lunged towards the tailor, but tripped over a crack in the floor (the very one the Devil had made!), and fell headlong into a huge vat of sticky molasses intended for the wedding cakes, where he sank without a trace, a truly sweet end for one who dealt in despair. "Well," remarked the tailor, wiping a splash of molasses from his sleeve, "At least the wedding cakes will be safe now." After that brief interruption, the music played again, and the feast continued with great merriment. The tailor ruled wisely beside the princess as her husband, known throughout the land for his cleverness rather than his sewing. He kept the magic sword safely in the treasury, though sometimes, it is said, he took it out in the form of a falcon just to see that all remained well in his kingdom. And they lived in great peace and happiness for many long years.
