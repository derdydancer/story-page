  "The Complete Story": {
    "Title": "The Discarded Musicians",
    "Chapters": [
      "There lay a beetle near the palace rubbish heap, stuck fast to a rusted pin which a prince had used, for he thought the beetle quite dead, but now its stiff legs began to wiggle just a little. It rocked itself this way and that upon the pin, pulled with all its might, and at last tumbled free onto a large cabbage leaf. The beetle looked about at the heap of discarded things, thought this place had no luck for beetles, and crawled off the cabbage leaf and down the dusty track away from the palace walls. Soon it met a large blue fly sitting upon a stone, buzzing sadly to itself with one wing bent quite crooked. \"Ho there, good fly,\" said the beetle, \"Why do you buzz so sadly upon that stone, and what ails your wing?\" \"Alas,\" answered the fly, \"I once buzzed for the prince himself until he caught me for his pin-cushion, but he thought my buzzing poor and poked the pin quite through my wing, bending it thus, before casting me out.\" \"Truly,\" said the beetle, \"I know that pin-cushion well, for the self-same prince stuck me quite through the middle and left me there for dead until this very morn.\" \"Then let us travel together,\" proposed the beetle, \"for the world must be better for us somewhere away from princes and pins.\" \"That suits me well enough,\" buzzed the fly, \"though you crawl slowly and I fly crookedly, perhaps together we shall scare someone important.\" So the beetle and the fly got themselves onto the track and set off together side-by-side, the one crawling, the other hobbling through the air.",
      "They had not travelled far along the track when they found a grasshopper lying quite still in the shade of a dock leaf, and it had but one jumping leg left to it. \"Ho, friend grasshopper,\" called the beetle, whilst the fly buzzed agreement, \"Why do you lie so still under that leaf, and where is your other leg?\" \"That same wicked prince,\" chirped the grasshopper weakly, \"kept me pinned beside a fine spider, but then he declared the spider needed eight legs, not seven, so he pulled my leg off with the pin itself and cast me away.\" \"Now I cannot jump to find food,\" it went on, \"nor can I hop away from danger; I must lie here and starve.\" \"Not so,\" said the beetle, \"Come with us, for we too are fleeing that prince and seeking a place without pins; perhaps your chirp, added to my scraping and the fly's sad buzzing, will help us make a fearsome noise.\" \"I will gladly come,\" chirped the grasshopper, trying its one good leg, \"for anything is better than starving beneath a dock leaf, though I fear we shall make a poor concert indeed.\" So the grasshopper hopped onto the track as best it could, and the three travelled onwards; the beetle crawled, the fly flew crookedly beside it, and the grasshopper took small, lopsided hops behind. Presently they saw a field mouse sitting beside the track, washing its whiskers with its paws. The mouse stopped washing and peered at them with its bright eyes, saying, \"Well now, and where might such a slow and crooked company be travelling in the heat of the day?\" \"We are off to seek our fortune,\" replied the beetle stoutly, \"or at least find a place where beetles are not pinned and flies may buzz freely, and grasshoppers keep both their legs.\"",
      "The mouse twitched its whiskers as if laughing, and said, \"Fortune indeed! Why, with a crawl, a limp, and a hop between you, you will be fortunate to reach the next ditch by nightfall.\" Just then, a large moth fluttered weakly down from a tall weed, landing in the dust near the beetle; its wings were dusty and had small holes in them. \"That prince again,\" sighed the moth, shaking dust from its antennae, \"He kept me on his cushion with the others, but first dusted me with a powder to still my wings, and now I cannot fly straight for the life of me.\" \"Goodness me!\" cried the mouse, forgetting its scorn, \"Another one escaped from the palace! You truly are a queer collection from that pin-cushion.\" \"Then you must join us, friend moth,\" said the beetle, \"for we are all fellows in misfortune, seeking a better place than that palace.\" \"I suppose I must,\" whispered the moth, \"for I am weary, and cannot fly far on these tattered wings alone.\" So the moth crawled onto the track beside the others, and the company of four travelled on: the beetle crawled, the fly limped in the air, the grasshopper hopped unevenly, and the moth fluttered low over the dust. The field mouse watched them go, twitched its nose, and called after them, \"Well, look for shelter before dark, for night comes quickly to such as you, and you will find little fortune sleeping in the open road!\" As evening began to fall, they came upon a little hut standing by the track under a large oak tree; it seemed empty, and its one window was dark. \"Let us see if we can find shelter here for the night,\" said the beetle, and the four companions turned off the track towards the door of the hut.",
      "They reached the wooden door and found a crack at the bottom; the beetle pushed with its head, the fly buzzed loudly against the wood, the grasshopper chirped encouragement, and the moth fanned the crack with its dusty wings, until it widened just enough. One by one they squeezed through the crack: the beetle crawled, the fly fluttered low, the grasshopper hopped sideways, and the moth tumbled in a heap. But the hut was not empty at all; inside, a rough gang of earwigs were feasting noisily around a mouldy turnip upon a small wooden table. The earwigs looked up from their turnip, saw the four companions, and brandished their fearsome tail-pincers, crying, \"Who dares enter our feast-hall uninvited?\" \"Good sirs,\" said the beetle cautiously, stepping forward, \"We are poor travellers seeking only shelter from the night, we mean no harm to you or your turnip.\" \"Harm or no harm, you cannot stay!\" snapped the largest earwig, \"We shall pinch you into pieces and use your shells for toothpicks if you do not leave at once!\" \"Now!\" cried the beetle, and at once he scraped his hard legs against his shell, the fly buzzed his loudest and most crooked buzz right by the earwigs' heads, the grasshopper chirped a high, thin shriek, and the moth fluttered madly about the single candle flame. The earwigs were terrified; they had never heard such a dreadful combination of scraping, buzzing, shrieking, and shadow-flickering, and thought a monster, a witch, a ghost, and perhaps a small fiery dragon had come upon them all at once. They tumbled over each other in their haste, scrambled out through the crack in the door, and did not stop running until they were far away in the darkest part of the woods. Then the four companions had the hut to themselves, and they made themselves comfortable at the table and finished the mouldy turnip with great enjoyment before falling fast asleep.",
      "For some time the four companions lived quite peacefully in the little hut, sleeping soundly at night and finding enough crumbs and stray seeds nearby to keep hunger away. One morning, as the beetle crawled out to look for dew drops, he saw a large spider spinning a glistening web across the path leading from the hut. \"Good morning, Mistress Spider,\" said the beetle, keeping a safe distance, \"Why do you spin your web just here, blocking our path to the fields?\" \"I spin where I please, beetle,\" replied the spider sharply, not pausing her work, \"and perhaps I shall catch my breakfast here; besides, paths are for those with enough legs to walk them properly.\" The grasshopper heard this from the doorway and chirped nervously, \"Friend beetle, I do not like this; perhaps it was she for whom the prince took my leg!\" \"Nonsense,\" buzzed the fly boldly, though keeping well back, \"I shall simply buzz around her head until she grows dizzy and spoils her own web!\" But the fly flew too close, and no sooner had it started buzzing near the spider's ear than its crooked wing caught a sticky thread, and it became entangled, buzzing louder now in fright than it ever had in sadness. The spider turned instantly at the frantic buzzing, left her spinning, and scuttled quickly along the web towards the trapped fly, licking her jaws. \"Wait!\" whispered the moth from the doorway, \"Our candle still burns inside from last night; perhaps if I fly close to the web near the door, the light will lure the spider away from the fly!\" The moth fluttered out bravely, and danced near the edge of the sticky web where the candlelight from inside the hut made the dewdrops glisten; the flickering light caught the spider's greedy eyes, and she turned from the fly and moved slowly towards the moth instead.",
      "Quickly, whilst the spider crept towards the moth, the beetle chewed busily at the thick strands holding the fly's legs, and the grasshopper used the sharp edge of its remaining jumping leg to saw at the thread on the bent wing, until the fly was freed. The fly shook itself, tested its bent wing, and then buzzed straight towards the spider's many eyes, not sadly now, but angrily, to help the moth who had saved it. The spider was startled by the angry buzzing near its face and confused by the moth's flickering light; it scuttled backwards off the web and vanished into a dark corner under the hut's eaves. \"Well flown, friend fly, and bravely fluttered, friend moth!\" said the beetle, \"The danger is past for now, but we must be careful, for that sticky web still blocks our way.\" \"Perhaps if we all pull together on one thick strand,\" chirped the grasshopper, \"we can break it or pull it aside.\" So the beetle gripped the main strand in its jaws, the fly and moth pulled with their legs, and the grasshopper pushed against the beetle's back with its head, until with a snap the strand broke and the whole web tore apart, sagging uselessly. The path to the fields was clear once more, and the four companions stood before the hut in the morning sun. \"What shall we do now?\" buzzed the fly nervously, looking towards the dark eaves, \"Shall we stay in this hut? I do not wish to stay, for that spider might return.\" \"No, let us go onwards,\" said the beetle, \"Perhaps we can find a proper garden somewhere, where there is plenty to eat and likely no princes with pin-cushions.\" All thought this a good plan, so the four friends left the little hut behind them and travelled out along the clear path towards the green fields.",
      "They travelled now through fields of tall grass where many flowers grew, and the path was softer under the beetle's feet and the grasshopper's hops. At last, towards the end of the day, they saw before them a high stone wall which seemed to run all around the edge of a large garden. They followed the wall for some way, and soon found a small hole near the bottom, hidden by ivy leaves, through which they could easily crawl. Inside was the finest garden they had ever seen, with rows of fat cabbages, beds of sweet flowers for the moth and fly, and low bushes full of ripe berries near the ground for the beetle and grasshopper. They knew at once they had found the place they sought, and that they would travel no further. Now, the garden belonged to an old woman who was a little deaf, and when she heard the small sounds of the beetle scraping, the fly buzzing, the grasshopper chirping, and the moth fluttering, she smiled and thought it fine music indeed. She would often leave out a crumb of cake or a drop of milk near the cabbage patch for her little musicians, as she called them. And so the four friends lived happily in the old woman's garden; the fly's wing even straightened a little with time, and they never thought of the prince or his pin-cushion again. The old woman often praised the pleasant buzzing and chirping from her cabbages, though others might have called it only noise. And if they have not left the garden or been eaten by birds, they are living there still."
