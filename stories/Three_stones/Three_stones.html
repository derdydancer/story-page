Ordinary efforts are insufficient.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The wise figure connected to nature (**Gardener**) reveals the problem stems from a deeper, hidden issue (\"blight\") requiring a connection to a transcendent or luminous source (\"tear of the sun-bird\").

The quest is genuinely difficult.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Initial attempts by established aspects of the **Ego** (elder sons, representing conventional approaches or perhaps pride) fail to reach the transcendent source.

Simple description.", "Moral Implication": "The journey leads to encounters with potential helpers or tests. Entering the forest often signifies entering a realm of magic and trial.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "After a period of initial effort (three days journey), the **Ego** reaches the threshold of the deep **Unconscious** (edge of dark forest).
