Three stones
There was once a king whose palace stood beside a great orchard, but for seven years no tree within it had borne any fruit.
So the king sent for the old gardener who had tended the trees since his own father's time, and asked him why the orchard gave no yield.
The old gardener bowed low and said, "Lord King, a hidden blight lies on the roots, and naught can cure it but a single tear shed by the sun-bird, which nests beyond the grey mountains."
Then the king caused it to be proclaimed throughout his land that whosoever should bring him the tear of the sun-bird should have his only daughter to wife and half of his kingdom besides.
Now, the king had three sons, and the eldest rode forth first with fine provisions, but he did not return; then the second son tried his fortune, yet he too vanished beyond the grey mountains.
At last the youngest son went before the king and said, "Father, let me go also and seek the sun-bird's tear."
But the king sighed and answered, "Child, what can you do where your clever brothers have perished? Stay home, lest I lose you too."
However, the youth begged and pleaded, saying only, "Father, I must go, for I know no fear," until the king sorrowfully gave him leave.
He took only a crust of bread in his pocket and a flask of water, and went his way on foot towards the grey mountains.
When he had journeyed three days, he came to the edge of a dark forest, and there sat a little grey woman warming her hands at a small fire.
The little grey woman looked up and asked, "Whither away so fast, young sir, through this lonely wood?"
"I seek the sun-bird which nests beyond the grey mountains," answered the youth, "for I must fetch its tear to cure our king's orchard, though my two brothers who went before me have not returned."
"Ah," said the woman, "that is a perilous road indeed. But your heart seems true; share your crust with me, and I will give you three black stones that may aid you."
The youth willingly broke his crust in two and gave her the larger piece, for she looked hungry and frail.
She thanked him kindly, and gave him three smooth black stones, saying, "Swallow one when you reach the iron gate, one when you cross the bridge of sighs, and one when you stand upon the highest peak before the sun-bird's nest."
Then she nodded and was gone, and the youth put the stones carefully in his pouch and entered the dark forest.
He walked till nightfall amongst strange, silent trees, and came at last to a great iron gate rusted shut, which barred his way entirely.
He remembered the old woman's words, and took out the first black stone and swallowed it down.
Scarcely had he swallowed it, when the great iron gate crumbled silently into dust before him.
The youth stepped over the place where it had stood and went onwards into the deeper wood.
He journeyed for another day, and the wood grew stranger, until he came to a great chasm, black and deep, spanned only by a bridge that seemed thin as a thread; this surely was the bridge of sighs.
He took out the second black stone, as the old woman had bidden him, and swallowed it quickly.
At once the thread-like bridge became broad and steady beneath his feet, and he crossed over the great chasm without fear.
On the other side, he found a maiden weeping softly beside the path.
The youth stopped and asked her kindly, "Fair maiden, why do you weep here all alone?"
She looked up, and her eyes were strangely bright, saying, "I am enchanted in this wood, and cannot leave until a knight plucks out all the thorns from yonder thicket with his bare hands."
The youth pitied her, and said bravely, "Weep no more, I will help you," and he went straightway to the thorny thicket.
He plucked and pulled at the sharp thorns for a long while, until his hands were torn and bleeding, yet he did not cease his work.
When the last thorn was plucked, the maiden laughed loud and sharp, and instead of thanking him, she drew a hidden knife and stabbed him through the heart, so that he fell down dead amongst the thorns.
And there the king's youngest son lay still and cold upon the ground, his blood watering the roots of the thorny thicket.
After a day and a night had passed, the little grey woman came hobbling along the path again and found the youth lying dead amongst the thorns.
She shook her head sadly and muttered, "Poor lad, bewitched by a false seeming," then took from her pocket a small green vial.
She uncorked it carefully and let three drops of a clear green liquid fall upon the wound where the knife had entered his heart.
No sooner had the drops touched him than the color returned to his face, he opened his eyes, and sat up, whole and sound again.
The grey woman looked sternly at him and said, "That was a wood-spirit in disguise, who feeds on foolish pity; compassion must be tempered with wisdom on this road. Now hasten onwards."
The youth looked down at the thorns and then at his mended chest, understood her meaning, thanked her humbly, and rose to his feet.
"Wait," said the old woman, "take this cloak of grey feathers; the sun-bird nests on the highest peak, guarded by fierce winds, but wrapped in this, they will think you one of their own kind and let you pass."
He took the cloak gratefully, wrapped it around his shoulders, and set off towards the highest peak of the grey mountains.
He climbed for a day through biting wind and swirling snow, until he stood upon the highest, barest peak, and remembered the old woman's words about the last black stone.
He swallowed the third stone, and at once the winds ceased their howling and the sun broke warmly through the clouds.
Before him, on the very summit, the youth saw the sun-bird's nest, built of pure gold and woven sunbeams.
In the nest sat the sun-bird itself, a creature of pure fire with feathers like the colours of the dawn.
He drew the grey cloak of feathers close about him, and was able to approach the nest unseen and unheard, just as the old woman had said.
As he watched, the sun-bird sang a single, piercing note of pure light, and a tear like liquid sunlight rolled from its eye.
The youth caught it gently in the small crystal flask he carried at his side.
With the tear safe in the flask, he turned immediately and began his journey homeward through the grey mountains.
The journey back was swifter than his coming, and the paths seemed clear before him.
He came at last, after many days, back to his father's kingdom and stood once more before the barren palace orchard.
He took the flask, and touched a single drop of the sun-bird's tear to the withered roots of the oldest tree.
At once, a ripple of green spread from that spot through the whole orchard; leaves unfurled, blossoms opened, and ripe fruit hung heavy on every branch where naught had grown for seven years.
The King looked out from his window and saw the miracle in the orchard, and knew his youngest son had returned successful.
He ran down to meet him at the orchard gate, and embraced him, crying, "My son, my dear son! You have saved us all!"
The youth showed the king the empty crystal flask, its task now done.
The king remembered his promise, and took the youth by the hand and led him into the palace hall where the court was assembled.
There stood the king's daughter, waiting as her father had commanded.
The king declared before them all, "Here is the one who has saved our land; to him I give my daughter to wife, and half my kingdom from this day forth."
The princess looked at the youth who had faced death for her father's kingdom, and she smiled upon him kindly.
So the wedding was held with great joy and feasting that lasted for seven days.
As for the two elder brothers, who had ridden forth so proudly, they were never seen again in the land.
And the youngest son lived long and happily with his bride, and after the old king's time, ruled wisely over the whole kingdom where the orchard now gave fruit in abundance every year.
