var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "Establishes the setting (a kingdom) and introduces the king, immediately highlighting his defining characteristic: a tendency towards unusual laws. This sets the stage for the central conflict driven by bizarre decrees.", "Grimm Style": "Starts with a simple statement introducing the king and kingdom. Uses a functional adjective (\"certain\") and establishes the king's nature directly (\"fond of making laws\"). Simple sentence structure.", "Moral Implication": "Hints at the potential problems arising from arbitrary or foolish rule-making. Authority wielded strangely.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The King represents the ruling conscious principle (Ego) or societal authority (Superego). His fondness for making laws, especially if bizarre, suggests a consciousness that is overly rigid, perhaps disconnected from common sense, or trying to impose arbitrary order on the world/psyche.", "Sentence": "There was once a king in a certain kingdom who was exceedingly fond of making laws.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces the first bizarre decree, creating immediate absurdity and potential conflict. This decree is specific and nonsensical, fulfilling the requirement for strange royal commands and injecting humour.", "Grimm Style": "Follows \"One day\" structure. States the decree plainly and matter-of-factly, despite its absurdity. Active voice (\"decreed\"). Simple vocabulary. The humour arises from the content, not the telling.", "Moral Implication": "Shows the folly of the king's law-making. Creates inconvenience or impossibility for the subjects. Questions the wisdom of unquestioning obedience.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The first bizarre decree (no walking backwards) represents an arbitrary rule imposed by the dominant conscious attitude (King). It restricts natural movement or behaviour in a nonsensical way, symbolizing perhaps neurotic constraints or irrational taboos within the psyche or society.", "Sentence": "One day he decreed that no man, woman, or child in his kingdom should walk backwards, not even by a single step.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Shows the immediate, comical consequence of the decree on ordinary people, highlighting its impracticality. Introduces a specific profession (baker) affected by the law.", "Grimm Style": "Simple sentence structure, focusing on action and consequence. Uses a generic profession (\"baker\"). Describes a visual, slightly humorous difficulty (\"great trouble,\" \"turning round and round\").", "Moral Implication": "Practical difficulties arise from foolish laws. Ordinary life is disrupted.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The constraint imposed by the conscious rule (decree) creates awkwardness and inefficiency in everyday functioning (baker's trouble). It shows how arbitrary psychic rules hinder natural adaptation and flow.", "Sentence": "This caused great trouble, especially for the baker who, when taking bread from his hot oven, found himself turning round and round like a spinning top.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces the protagonist, establishing his low social status (miller's third son) and his characteristic trait (cleverness or perhaps simple common sense), positioning him as someone likely to challenge or navigate the absurd situation.", "Grimm Style": "Introduces the hero generically (\"a miller,\" \"his third son\"). Uses a simple, functional adjective (\"clever\"). Follows the \"youngest/third son\" archetype pattern (often underestimated but successful).", "Moral Implication": "Suggests that cleverness or common sense might find solutions where others struggle. Hints that solutions might come from lower social strata.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The protagonist emerges from a common background (miller's son), often symbolizing potential arising from the collective or humble aspects of the psyche. Being the third son aligns with the archetype of the underestimated figure who succeeds. \"Clever\" suggests adaptability and ingenuity of the developing Ego.", "Sentence": "Now, there was a miller in a village nearby who had three sons, and the youngest was thought to be quite clever.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 4}, {"Plot Function": "Shows the protagonist observing the problem caused by the decree, specifically the difficulty it imposes on his father's work. This provides his motivation to act.", "Grimm Style": "Simple observation (\"saw his father\"). Describes the practical problem clearly (\"could scarcely turn the heavy sacks\"). Connects the hero directly to the conflict's impact.", "Moral Implication": "Awareness of the problem and its effect on loved ones can spur action.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The developing Ego (third son) observes the negative impact of the rigid conscious rule (decree) on the vital functioning of the psyche or family system (father miller struggling with sacks). This awareness motivates the search for a solution.", "Sentence": "The third son saw his father struggle greatly, for he could scarcely turn the heavy sacks of flour without taking a backward step.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "The protagonist devises a simple, practical, and slightly comical solution to the specific problem his father faces, demonstrating his cleverness.", "Grimm Style": "Describes the invention simply (\"fashioned a sort of harness\"). Explains its function (\"turn the sacks without the man needing to step back\"). Focuses on the practical solution.", "Moral Implication": "Ingenuity can overcome foolish obstacles. Simple solutions are often effective.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The clever Ego devises a tool or strategy (harness) to navigate the restriction imposed by the neurotic rule (decree). This represents adaptive thinking, finding a way to function effectively despite arbitrary psychic limitations, using ingenuity rather than direct confrontation initially.", "Sentence": "So the clever son fashioned a sort of harness with ropes and a pole, which allowed his father to turn the sacks without the man needing to step back at all.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 6}, {"Plot Function": "The King hears about this invention, indicating news travels and that cleverness, even in humble stations, gets noticed by authority. This brings the protagonist to the King's attention.", "Grimm Style": "Simple statement of news reaching the King (\"Word of this harness reached the king\"). Uses \"harness\" as the key Ordinary Item. Sets up the first interaction between the hero and the King.", "Moral Implication": "Cleverness and useful inventions gain recognition, even under a foolish ruler.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego's successful adaptation (harness) comes to the attention of the ruling conscious principle (King). Consciousness notices successful strategies for dealing with its own imposed limitations.", "Sentence": "Word of this harness reached the king, who was greatly interested in anything to do with his laws.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 7}, {"Plot Function": "The King summons the protagonist, wanting to see the invention and its creator. This is the hero's first direct encounter with royal power.", "Grimm Style": "Standard royal action (\"sent for the miller's son\"). States the King's desire (\"wished to see this clever device\"). Moves the plot forward to the encounter.", "Moral Implication": "Opportunity arises from ingenuity. The hero is called before authority.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The ruling consciousness (King) summons the adaptive Ego (miller's son) to examine its creation. This represents the central authority taking notice of and wanting to understand the successful coping mechanism developed at the periphery.", "Sentence": "He sent for the miller's son at once, saying he wished to see this clever device himself.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 8}, {"Plot Function": "The protagonist presents his invention to the King. The King, instead of praising the solution to the problem *his* law created, focuses on a new, related, but equally bizarre decree inspired by the invention. Introduces the second decree and more humour.", "Grimm Style": "Describes the presentation (\"showed the king\"). King's reaction is unexpected and focuses on a new law, not the solution. States the second decree matter-of-factly (\"no man should use a pole longer than his own arm\"). Adheres to the King's established character.", "Moral Implication": "Foolish rulers may twist solutions into new problems. Authority can be arbitrary and nonsensical. Lack of gratitude or recognition for solving the initial problem.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The ruling consciousness (King), instead of integrating the Ego's clever adaptation (harness), responds by creating a *new* arbitrary restriction related to the solution (pole length decree). This symbolizes how neurotic patterns can persist, shifting focus rather than resolving, or how one rigid rule replaces another. The Ego's cleverness inadvertently inspires further nonsensical constraints.", "Sentence": "When the miller's son showed the king the harness and the pole, the king declared, \"Excellent, but from this day forth, no man shall use a pole longer than his own arm!\"", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 9}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the immediate negative consequence of the *second* decree, rendering the protagonist's invention useless and highlighting the King's capricious nature. Ends the chapter with the hero facing a setback caused directly by the King's absurdity.", "Grimm Style": "Simple cause and effect (new decree -> harness useless). Uses \"alas\" for tone. Focuses on the practical outcome. Straightforward language.", "Moral Implication": "The whims of rulers can undo good work. Ingenuity is punished or made irrelevant by arbitrary power. Frustration of dealing with irrational authority.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The new arbitrary rule (pole length) immediately negates the Ego's previous adaptation (harness becomes useless). This demonstrates how shifting neurotic constraints can invalidate previously successful coping mechanisms, forcing the Ego back into a state of difficulty or requiring new solutions.", "Sentence": "Alas, the pole for the miller's harness was quite long, and so the clever device became useless overnight.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 10}, {"Plot Function": "Shows the protagonist's reaction to the setback \u2013 not despair, but thoughtful contemplation, reinforcing his clever nature. He returns home to think, indicating a retreat to find a new solution.", "Grimm Style": "Simple action (\"went home\"). Describes his state simply (\"thought for a day and a night\"). Focuses on external action representing internal process.", "Moral Implication": "Persistence and thoughtfulness in the face of absurdity. Retreating to think is a valid strategy.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (miller's son) retreats from the frustrating encounter with the ruling consciousness (King) to process the setback and devise a new strategy. This represents introspection or incubation needed for creative problem-solving after an adaptation fails.", "Sentence": "The miller's son went home and thought for a day and a night about the king's new law.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 11}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces a new, even more bizarre decree from the King, unrelated to the previous ones. This escalates the absurdity and creates a new, kingdom-wide problem. Requirement: Bizarre Decree.", "Grimm Style": "Uses \"Meanwhile\" to shift focus back to the King. States the third decree plainly (\"no creature with feathers should fly higher than the king's hat\"). Active voice (\"decreed\"). Matter-of-fact tone despite the impossibility.", "Moral Implication": "The King's folly escalates, moving from human behaviour to controlling nature impossibly. Shows detachment from reality.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The ruling consciousness (King) imposes yet another irrational restriction, this time attempting to control natural, spontaneous psychic phenomena (birds flying = thoughts, inspirations, spirit). Trying to limit flight \"higher than the king's hat\" symbolizes the Ego trying to keep all psychic activity below its own level of conscious control or status, fearing transcendence or uncontrollable thoughts/imagination.", "Sentence": "Meanwhile, the king, feeling pleased with his law-making, decreed that no creature with feathers should fly higher than the king's own hat when he stood upon his balcony.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 12}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the immediate, impossible situation created for the kingdom's birds, injecting humour through the image of birds trying to comply with an impossible law.", "Grimm Style": "Focuses on the effect on animals (\"birds were in great confusion\"). Simple description of absurd behaviour (\"flying low,\" \"bumping into chimneys\"). Concrete imagery.", "Moral Implication": "Highlights the sheer idiocy of the law by showing its effect on nature. Laws detached from reality cause chaos or impossibility.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The attempt to enforce the irrational psychic rule causes confusion and dysfunction among natural psychic energies (birds). Thoughts/inspirations become grounded or disordered (\"flying low,\" \"bumping into things\"), unable to soar naturally under such arbitrary limits.", "Sentence": "Naturally, the birds of the kingdom were in great confusion, flying low and bumping into chimneys and trees in their efforts to obey.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 13}, {"Plot Function": "The protagonist, having thought about the *pole* problem, now encounters this *new* bird problem, shifting his focus. He witnesses the chaos firsthand.", "Grimm Style": "Simple transition (\"The miller's son\"). Describes his action (\"came out of his house\"). States his observation (\"saw the poor birds\"). Connects him to the new problem.", "Moral Implication": "Awareness of wider problems beyond personal ones. Empathy for the affected creatures.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (miller's son), emerging from introspection on the previous problem, encounters the chaos caused by the *new* neurotic constraint affecting natural psychic processes (birds). This draws his attention to a different level of dysfunction.", "Sentence": "The miller's son came out of his house and saw the poor birds flapping about in distress near the ground.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 14}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces a key magic item: the snare. The protagonist finds it unexpectedly, suggesting fate or luck. Its specific property (catching the unstoppable) is stated, hinting at its future importance. Requirement: Magic Snare.", "Grimm Style": "Simple discovery (\"noticed something glinting\"). Item described simply (\"a small snare made of woven moonlight\"). States its magical property directly (\"it was said... could trap that which seemed most unstoppable\"). Classic introduction of a magic item.", "Moral Implication": "Help or solutions can appear unexpectedly. Magic exists in the world. The snare represents a tool for dealing with overwhelming power.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego finds a magical tool (snare) serendipitously. Made of \"woven moonlight,\" it suggests a connection to the unconscious, intuition, the feminine, or subtle energies. Its ability to \"trap the unstoppable\" signifies a potent psychic mechanism or insight capable of containing overwhelming forces, impulses, or even seemingly inevitable fates. It's a gift from the unconscious.", "Sentence": "As he watched them, he noticed something glinting in the grass; it was a small snare made of woven moonlight, and it was said by old folk that such a snare could trap that which seemed most unstoppable.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 15}, {"Plot Function": "The protagonist decides to use the magic snare, not for the birds directly, but targeting the *cause* of the problem: the King's hat, which dictates the flight ceiling. This shows clever, indirect problem-solving. Humour in the target.", "Grimm Style": "States the idea simply (\"An idea came to him\"). Describes his action (\"took the snare,\" \"went towards the palace\"). Identifies the target (\"king's hat\").
