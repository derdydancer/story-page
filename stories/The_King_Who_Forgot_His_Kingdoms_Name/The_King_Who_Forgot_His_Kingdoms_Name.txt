The King Who Forgot His Kingdom's Name
There was once a king who, try as he might, could not recall the name of his very own kingdom. This made all his royal proclamations very difficult, for he had to speak of 'this fine land of ours' or 'our beloved realm here'. He lived in constant fear of being found out, and so he took great pains to avoid any talk of maps or histories. When ambassadors from other lands came, he would quickly turn the talk to the weather or the quality of their horses. His Royal Chancellor, a man with spectacles on his nose, began to think the king was a little forgetful in many matters. One day, the Chancellor brought forth old treaties, saying, 'Your Majesty, regarding the ancient pact with the Kingdom of... of... over there, you recall its terms?'. The king coughed loudly, clutched his stomach, and cried, 'A sudden ache, Chancellor, a terrible ache! We shall speak of this... later!'. Then the king hurried from the room, leaving the Chancellor holding the dusty treaties and looking more puzzled than before. Now it happened that the kingdom's trade with its neighbours began to suffer, for royal seals and charters lacked the kingdom's true name. Merchants came to the Chancellor, wringing their hands and saying their goods were turned away at borders for want of proper naming on their papers.
The Chancellor, seeing this new trouble, thought he must discover the kingdom's name by some other means, for to ask the king again would only cause more royal stomach-aches. So he went to the Royal Library, a place full of dusty scrolls and great leather-bound books, but found them all in a terrible jumble. The Royal Librarian, a thin man who collected fallen hairs from the carpet, only said, 'Everything is in its proper place, if only one knows where that place is!'. The Chancellor searched for three whole days, sneezing from the dust, and turning pages until his fingers were black with old ink. He found many curious things about the making of cheese and the proper way to address a duke's third cousin, but not the name of the kingdom. Meanwhile, the king, trying to sound decisive, summoned the new Royal Cook who had been hired only the day before. He declared, 'Cook, you are to prepare for tonight's feast the Great Imperial Soup of... of... this place, with exactly seventeen peppercorns, no more, no less!'. The cook, a stout man with flour on his eyebrows, stood gaping, for he had never heard of such a soup in all his travels. He began to ask, 'But Your Majesty, what are the other ingredients for this...?' when the king waved a dismissive hand. 'Peppercorns, Cook! That is the essence!' the king thundered, and swept from the kitchens, leaving the cook to scratch his head in despair.
The Chancellor, meanwhile, decided that if books held no answer, perhaps living memory would, and he sought out the oldest man in the capital city. This fellow was said to be one hundred and seven years of age and was very deaf, so when the Chancellor asked, 'Good father, can you tell me the name of this great kingdom of ours?' the old man just nodded brightly. He replied, 'Aye, the weather has been fair for the cabbages this year, though my left knee pains me something awful when the east wind blows!'. The Chancellor shouted, 'The KINGDOM'S NAME, good sir!' but the old man only cupped his ear and said, 'The price of beans, you say? Robbery, that's what it is!'. The Chancellor sighed, gave the old man a shiny coin for his time, and went away no wiser than he had come. Meanwhile, the king, wishing to appear as kingly as any other, decided to hold a great tournament for all the knights of 'this particular part of the world'. Heralds were sent out, but as they could not properly name the kingdom inviting them, many knights from afar simply scratched their heads and stayed home. However, a few knights from within 'the usual borders' understood well enough and arrived, polishing their armor. When the champion knight was declared, the king had to present him with a golden shield, and he instructed the engraver to inscribe it: 'For Valor, Within These Well-Known And Clearly Marked Boundaries'. The champion knight, a burly man with a large moustache, looked much perplexed at the shield but bowed low all the same.
Now it came to pass that a young prince from a prosperous and extremely well-named kingdom to the north arrived at the palace gates. He had journeyed for many weeks with his retinue, intending to forge an alliance and seeking to have a grand treaty drawn up, with the names of both their noble lands upon it. When the king heard of the prince's mission, he grew quite pale and paced his chamber for a full hour. At last he called his Chancellor and said, 'It is an ancient and very solemn custom in... in... this vicinity... that the host king must affect a temporary deafness when discussing matters of great import, lest he be swayed by mere eloquence!'. The Chancellor raised his eyebrows so high they nearly vanished into his hair, but he bowed and said, 'A most... singular custom, Your Majesty. I shall inform the prince.'. When the young prince was ushered in, resplendent in silk and silver, the king immediately cupped a hand to his ear and adopted a look of intense, straining concentration. The prince, though puzzled, began his carefully prepared speech, 'Greetings, noble King, from my father, King Alaric of the glorious Kingdom of Argentia! I come to speak of...'. 'Pens and ink are dear, you say?' the king shouted, nodding vigorously. 'Indeed, indeed, the cost of good quills is a trial to us all!'. The young prince stopped his speech, his mouth slightly open, and looked to the Chancellor for some explanation of this royal hearing impediment. The Chancellor could only offer a small, apologetic shrug as the king continued to nod wisely about the price of writing implements.
The next day, the young prince, being a resourceful fellow, suggested a royal hunt, thinking the fresh air might clear the king's hearing or loosen his tongue. The king, who enjoyed hunting more than treaties that required naming places, clapped his hands and agreed at once. Deep in the forest, while chasing a magnificent white stag, the king and the young prince found themselves separated from the other hunters. The prince, wiping his brow, said casually, 'A fine forest this is, Your Majesty! It must stretch for many leagues within your admirable... territory?'. The king, startled, peered at a nearby tree and declared with great authority, 'Hark, Prince! The way that moss grows only on the north-south side indicates... a badger of unusual size passed this way just yesterday!'. The young prince, who was a keen huntsman himself and knew a good deal about moss and badgers, merely blinked and said, 'Indeed, Your Majesty?'. 'Yes, and a very swift one!' the king exclaimed, then spurred his horse suddenly, shouting, 'After him! For the glory of... of... this general area!' and galloped off into the trees. The prince, left standing alone by the mossy tree, shook his head slowly and began to suspect the king of this land was not merely eccentric, but perhaps truly addled. When they all regrouped at the palace, the Chancellor saw the prince's troubled face and knew that something drastic had to be done about the king's peculiar condition. That night, the Chancellor paced his own chambers, muttering, 'A king who knows not his own kingdom's name is no king for a treaty! I must find a way, any way at all!'
It was then that the Chancellor remembered a tale his own grandfather had told, of a Royal Geographer banished by the current king's father for making maps of lands that 'did not exist'. Perhaps, the Chancellor mused, such a man, if he could be found, would have recorded the kingdom's name with an almost fanatical precision, even on his most outlandish charts. He called his most trusted and tight-lipped servant and tasked him with finding this old Geographer, if indeed he still drew breath. After many days of searching, the servant found the Royal Geographer, now a very old man with ink-stains up to his elbows, living in a remote hut and mapping the constellations in spilled porridge. The old Geographer cackled when he heard the request and said he knew the name well, but would only speak it aloud before the king himself, on the night of the next comet with two tails. The Chancellor, informed by his astronomers that such a comet was indeed due in three nights, agreed to this peculiar arrangement with a troubled sigh. On the appointed night, as the twin-tailed comet blazed across the dark sky, the Chancellor had the old Geographer brought to the grand hall, telling the king only that a 'most unique storyteller' had arrived. The old Geographer, looking like a bundle of sticks in his patched robe, bowed creakily and then, instead of speaking, unrolled a vast, ancient map covered in winding lines and strange symbols. He tapped a gnarled finger on a swirling vortex at its very centre and proclaimed, 'Your Majesty, this kingdom, your kingdom, has always been, and shall always be, known as... the Land of Regret-Not!'. 'Your own father, the late king,' the Geographer continued, his voice surprisingly strong, 'deemed this name encouraged a certain... unkingly lack of foresight, and he tried to call it 'Sensible Borough', a name so dull even he forgot it, but 'Regret-Not' is its true heart, Sire!'
The king stared at the map, the strange name echoing in the silent hall, and for the first time in many years, he did not clutch his stomach nor feign deafness, but simply stood still as a statue. The young prince from Argentia, who had thought the king addled, now saw a different light in the older man's eyes, a flicker of something long lost and suddenly remembered. Then the king spoke, his voice quiet, 'Regret-Not. So that is what this place is truly called.'. And as he said it, a draft of fresh air seemed to blow through the hall, though all the windows were closed, and the twin-tailed comet outside blazed brighter for a moment. The Chancellor, seeing the king neither cough nor complain of aches, let out a breath he had unknowingly held for many years. The king turned to the young prince of Argentia, a new strength in his voice, and declared, 'Prince, concerning that treaty between Argentia and the Kingdom of Regret-Not, let us speak plainly now, as true kings should!'. The prince grinned, for he liked the sound of this 'Regret-Not' far more than 'Sensible Borough', and replied, 'Your Majesty of Regret-Not, I believe we shall have much to discuss indeed!'. And in the kitchens below, the Royal Cook, hearing the cheers and the clear mention of 'Regret-Not', threw his seventeen peppercorns out the window with a sigh of great relief. From that day forward, the Kingdom of Regret-Not thrived, for the king ruled with a bold spirit that suited its name, and his decisions, though sometimes surprising, often turned out remarkably well. And so the king never again had to speak of 'our beloved realm here', for he knew its true, spirited name and was not afraid to use it before any man, badger, or comet.
