The Stone of Sighs
Once upon a time, there lay a stone beside a dusty road.
It was not large, nor was it handsome, being grey and smooth like a thousand others.
Yet this stone was not like the others, for it held a secret: it could hear the wishes of men, but it had no mind to grant them.
It only wished to be left alone, and when someone wished upon it, the stone would sigh, a sound so faint only the wind might notice, and twist the wish awry.
One day, a farmer came by, driving his lean cow. His cart had lost a wheel, and he sat weary on the ground. He saw the stone and thought, "Perhaps this stone has some luck in it." He picked it up, felt its smoothness, and sighed himself. "Ah, stone," said he, "I wish I had a strong new wheel for my cart, so I might reach the market ere nightfall."
The stone sighed, unheard. Then, down the road came a great clatter. A rich merchant's carriage, driving too fast, struck a rut, and snap! Its fine red wheel broke clean off and rolled right to the farmer's feet. "There is your wheel!" cried the merchant angrily. "But it is mine, and broken besides! You there, help me!" The farmer spent the next hour helping the fuming merchant, and never reached the market at all that day. He cast the stone away in vexation.
So the stone lay in the grass. Soon a young maiden walked by, weeping softly. Her gown was torn, and her face sad. "My father has lost all his coin," she whispered to the stone, picking it up. "I wish I had but one shining gold piece, enough to buy bread for the week."
The stone sighed. At that moment, a hawk flew overhead, and from its talons dropped something bright. It landed near the maiden's feet – a lady's earring, all of gold and pearl. "Oh, fortune!" cried the maiden. But as she picked it up, the lady herself came running from a nearby path. "My earring! Thief!" she shrieked, though the maiden was innocent. The lady called her servants, and the poor maiden was dragged away to explain herself to the bailiff, finding more trouble than treasure. She dropped the stone in her fright.
Then came a soldier, limping from the wars. He had naught but his worn coat and an empty belly. He saw the stone and clutched it hard. "Stone," he muttered, "I wish I had a good horse beneath me, to carry me home to my village."
The stone sighed its weary sigh. Just then, around the bend came a fine black horse, riderless, its saddlebags bulging. The soldier's eyes lit up. But behind the horse ran three grim-faced men with cudgels. "Stop him! He has stolen the master's horse!" they yelled, seeing the soldier near it. The soldier, knowing he could not explain, had to flee into the woods, running farther from his village than before. He cursed the stone and threw it deep among the trees.
There the stone lay for many a year, covered by leaves and moss. No one came by to wish upon it. The wind blew, the rain fell, and the stone was content. It heard no wishes, and it sighed no more. It wanted only peace, and at last, in the quiet dark of the woods, it had found it. And perhaps it lies there still, glad to be forgotten.
