var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "Establishes the initial character (King), his status (widower), and introduces the setting element that will become the source of conflict (the library), linking it to his deceased wife and his sorrow. This sets a slightly melancholic initial tone, common before the main problem emerges.", "Grimm Style": "Follows the \"Once upon a time\" structure indirectly (\"There was once...\"). Introduces an archetypal character (King). Mentions a key setting (library). Simple sentence structure. Uses basic emotions (\"sorrow\"). No complex vocabulary. Adheres to guide Part 10 (Setting Time/Place, Political Aspects).", "Moral Implication": "Hints at loss and perhaps the weight of the past (empty library linked to dead wife). Sets up a situation ripe for unusual occurrences.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The King represents the ruling **Ego**, diminished by loss (widower). The empty library symbolizes a void in knowledge, wisdom, or the neglected feminine principle (associated with the deceased Queen). The sorrow indicates the conscious state affected by this loss.", "Sentence": "There was once a king whose wife had died, leaving him much sorrow and a great empty library.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces the central, mysterious conflict: the library inexplicably filling with books overnight. This is the core problem driving the story, as requested. It shifts the tone from sorrowful to uncanny.", "Grimm Style": "Simple transition (\"But\"). Describes a strange, magical event matter-of-factly (\"each morn... found new books\"). Uses simple, concrete nouns (\"shelves,\" \"books\"). Clear cause/effect (night passes -> books appear). Adheres to guide Part 1 (Language), Part 10 (Describing Events - state magical transformations plainly).", "Moral Implication": "Presents an unexplained phenomenon, potentially a blessing or a curse. It disrupts the natural order. How the King reacts will reveal his character.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The empty space of knowledge/wisdom (library) is being mysteriously filled from an unknown source (overnight = from the unconscious). This represents an influx of unconscious content into the conscious realm, potentially overwhelming or unmanageable. The books symbolize knowledge, stories, or archetypal patterns emerging autonomously. This is the main conflict as requested.", "Sentence": "But each morn when the king went to mourn therein, he found new books upon the shelves where none had been the night before.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Shows the King's initial reaction \u2013 confusion and attempts at control (ordering the books removed). This demonstrates the practical problem the books create (filling space) and the King's inability to stop the phenomenon by mundane means.", "Grimm Style": "Simple conjunction (\"At first\"). Describes the King's reaction simply (\"did not know what to think\"). Shows his action (\"ordered them carried away\"). Simple sentence structure. Focuses on external action, not internal debate.", "Moral Implication": "Highlights the limits of authority against the inexplicable. Shows a practical, but ultimately ineffective, response to a magical problem.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The **Ego** (King) is confused by the influx of unconscious content (books) and tries to simply remove or discard it (\"ordered them carried away\"). This represents denial or repression \u2013 trying to get rid of the emerging material without understanding it.", "Sentence": "At first the king did not know what to think, and ordered them carried away, but the library grew ever fuller.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "Establishes the failure of the King's mundane solution and the escalating nature of the problem. The growing number of books becomes a physical burden and reinforces the magical nature of the event.", "Grimm Style": "Uses \"So it went\" for passage of time/repetition. Simple description of the escalating problem (\"so many books... no room left\"). Uses concrete consequence (\"servants piled them in the halls\").", "Moral Implication": "Mundane solutions fail against magic. The problem cannot be ignored or simply removed; it demands a different approach.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Repressing the emerging unconscious content (books) is futile; it continues to proliferate (\"grew ever fuller\") and spills out, cluttering the conscious space (halls).
