The Singing Fish
There was once a king whose wife had died, leaving him much sorrow and a great empty library. But each morn when the king went to mourn therein, he found new books upon the shelves where none had been the night before. At first the king did not know what to think, and ordered them carried away, but the library grew ever fuller. So it went, until there were so many books that there was no room left in the library, and the king's servants piled them in the halls. Then the king sent forth word into all the land, offering riches and estates to any man who could discover whence the books came and make them cease. Many wise men came and studied the library, and soldiers kept watch all night, but none could solve the riddle, and the books still came each night. Now there lived not far from the king's city a miller who had three sons, and the youngest was held to be good for little but dreaming. This youngest son heard the king's word, and said to himself one day, "I will go and try my fortune, for naught worse can befall me than staying here." His father and brothers laughed at him, and said, "What use is a dreamer at court? Take this leaky bucket to carry your hopes in," but he paid them no mind. He paid them no mind, but took from the wall an old stuffed fish, a great bass his mother had prized, and set off for the king's city.
When the miller's son came to the city gates, the guard laughed to see such a simple fellow carrying a dusty fish, yet the youth said only, "I have come to stop the books." The guard, thinking it good sport, said, "Aye, a fool's errand is best started quickly; follow the piles of books, they reach nigh to the throne room now," and let him pass. The miller's son walked through halls where books were piled high as a man's chest, and saw weary servants and bewildered courtiers stepping around them. He came before the king, who sat looking tiredly at a map, bowed low, and said, "Your Majesty, I am here about the books, and I carry only this fish." The king sighed, looked at the fish, and said, "Another try? Very well. A fish. How helpful. Go into the library and watch this night; perhaps the books will dislike the company." So the miller's son did as he was bid, and went into the great library, dusty and silent save for the faint rustling of unseen pages, and hung the great bass upon the wall. As midnight drew near, the youth watching tiredly, the fish's glass eye seemed to gleam in the gloom, and its stiff tail gave a small twitch. Then its wooden mouth opened, and in a reedy, surprising voice, it began to sing: "Dusty covers, pages deep, / While the lonely king does weep, / Knowledge comes, but not to keep!" The miller's son sat bolt upright and stared, understanding little save that this was surely the strangest fish in all the world. And indeed, even as the fish sang its last note, books began to appear upon the shelves, sliding softly into empty spaces as if placed by unseen hands.
Remembering the fish's words "not to keep," the youth leapt up and tried to grab the books as they appeared, thinking to throw them out. But as soon as his hand touched a cover, it turned not to paper but to sharp stinging nettles, making him cry out and snatch his hand away. He saw this was no use, and nursing his stinging fingers, turned to the fish upon the wall and asked, "Wise fish, if the books cannot be kept and cannot be touched, what must I do?" The fish waggled its tail once more and sang, "The Queen's lost thimble, silver bright, / Fell down the well one moonless night. / Find the thimble, set things right!" With that, the books stopped appearing, the fish fell silent and still, and the first light of dawn crept through the high library windows. The miller's son went to the king and said, "Your Majesty, I cannot yet stop the books, but I know I must first find the Queen's silver thimble, lost long ago in the courtyard well." The King was amazed, for he remembered his dear wife's thimble and how she had wept losing it down the well years past. "Go then," he said, "and if you find it, you shall have a purse of gold and a new suit of clothes." The miller's son went to the courtyard well, lowered the leaky bucket his brothers had scorned, and drew up the silver thimble at the very first try. He brought the thimble, shining still, to the amazed king. The king was true to his word, and gave him the purse of gold and a fine new suit of clothes, though he still carried the fish.
But that night, the books still came, filling the halls yet further, and the king looked again to the miller's son. The youth, dressed in his new clothes but feeling no wiser, went again to the library at nightfall, knowing only the fish might help further. At midnight the fish awoke and sang: "The bear in cage does sadly sigh, / He wants his honey, sweet and high. / The key upon his collar fast, / Unlocks a truth that's meant to last!" The youth understood he needed honey, and went at dawn to the royal beehives, asking the beekeeper for a pot of the finest sort. He went to the royal menagerie, where a great brown bear paced in a strong cage, and it growled low as the youth approached with the pot of honey. The youth spoke gently and offered the honey through the bars; the bear stopped growling, greedily licked the pot clean, then rolled happily on its back, allowing the youth to reach through and unfasten the rusty key from its thick collar. He returned to the king and showed him the key, holding it carefully, for it was indeed very old and rusty. The king was pleased, and gave him a fine black horse and leave to practice arms with the young knights in the castle yard, saying, "You have sharp wits for a miller's son, perhaps you need a sword." Yet that night, the mysterious books appeared again, tumbling from shelves and making the weary servants groan. So for the third night, the miller's son, now looking somewhat knightly but still carrying his fish, went faithfully to keep watch in the library.
At midnight, the great bass sang again, clearer than before: "The Cook whose belly shakes with glee, / Thinks hidden things are known to he. / Best him in riddles, three times three, / And gain the prize I hold for thee!" As it finished singing, the fish spat out a single iridescent scale onto the floor before falling silent again. The youth carefully picked up the scale, tucked it inside his tunic, and the next morning went down to the steamy royal kitchens to seek the cook. He found the royal cook, a fat, red-faced man stirring a great pot of stew, who boasted loudly to the kitchen lads that he knew every secret in the castle. The miller's son bowed and said, "Good Cook, I hear you are wise in secrets; let us trade riddles, and see who knows more." The Cook laughed so hard his ladle nearly fell in the stew, and said scornfully, "Trade riddles with a simpleton dressed as a knight? Gladly! I shall win easily." They traded riddles nine times back and forth; the Cook grew less sure with each turn, while the youth, perhaps aided by the fish scale warm against his skin, answered rightly every time and won the contest. The Cook, unused to losing, flew into a rage, raised his heavy stew ladle high, and brought it down hard towards the youth's head. But the youth was quick, having learned much in the castle yard; he drew the sword the king had given him and ran the cook through the belly, so he fell down quite dead amongst the carrots and onions. The miller's son wiped his sword, went straight to the king, and told him how he had won the riddles, and how the cook had attacked him, and how the cook was now dead.
The king nodded slowly and said, "The cook was ever boastful; it served him right. He will riddle me no more boiling my soup too thin! You shall be my sword and shield henceforth, and stand beside my throne." But still, the books came each night, filling every corner, until the castle seemed more library than fortress, and paper rustled in every draft. The king said to the youth, now his trusted advisor, "One task remains: discover the secret of these endless books, and you shall have my daughter's hand in marriage." The youth bowed, his heart beating quickly, and knew he must spend a fourth night in the library, listening to the fish upon the wall. That night, the fish sang its longest song: "No curse it is, no magic blight, / But Queenly wisdom, clear and bright. / His endless tears, the King's sad plight, / Call forth her words into the night. / Use rusty key in pale moonlight, / Touch scale to page, reveal the light!" The youth waited for the moonlight to fall upon the central bookshelf, then took the rusty key won from the bear, and touched it to the lock of a large, plain-bound book that had just appeared. The old lock clicked open smoothly, though it had no visible keyhole before that moment. He opened the cover, took out the iridescent scale the fish had given him, and gently touched it to the first page. The pages shone with a soft light, and words appeared clear and fair, telling not of dark magic, but of the late Queen's wisdom, her funny stories, and the songs she wrote for her husband. The youth understood at last; the books were not a plague, but a gift born of sorrow, and they would cease only when the king himself read them and let his grief run its course.
He went to the king at dawn, showed him the open book shining faintly, and explained what the fish had sung and what must be done. Tears welled in the king's eyes as he understood; he took the book gently and nodded, ready at last to read his wife's legacy. For many days the king read from the books, sometimes weeping freely, sometimes laughing at a remembered jest, and as his sorrow found its voice, the books appeared no more in the library. The king, his heart lighter, was true to his word again, and announced the wedding of his daughter to the miller's son who had saved the castle from drowning in books. There was a great feast, and the fish hung proudly on the dining hall wall, though some said it winked during the toasts. His father and brothers came to the wedding, and bowed very low indeed, and they did not mention the leaky bucket. It was discovered later that the old head gardener, greedy for gold, had been stealing the rarest of the Queen's books each morning to sell in secret. As punishment, the king ordered him planted head-first in the royal compost heap and fed only with watered-down ink until he learned to appreciate stories more than silver. The miller's son and the princess lived wisely and ruled well, and the Queen's books were often read aloud, bringing comfort and laughter back to the castle. And that is why we always say, "A singing fish knows more than a shelf of unread books."
