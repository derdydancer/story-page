The Dancers of the Silver Leaves
The king sat in his great hall, but paid little heed to the matters of state brought before him. A faint scent of old wine rose from the golden cup he turned slowly in his hands. His gaze followed the fine carving of silver leaves that wound about its stem. Many a day the courtiers had seen him thus, lost in the contemplation of the cup. The king’s son, who had a watchful eye like his father, stood quietly by a tall window. He watched the king turn the cup, round and round, in the pale light. Sometimes, the son thought he heard faint music, as if from a great distance or a dream. One evening, the king rose from his chair and called for his old travelling cloak. The son watched as a servant brought it; the cloak was dark and heavy, with no clasp, and the son felt the thick wool of it as his father passed. The king said naught to anyone, but wrapped the cloak about him and walked out into the twilight.
After a time, the king's son also took a plain cloak and slipped from the hall. The air was cold outside the castle walls, and there was a scent of damp earth and fallen leaves. He saw his father ahead, a dark shape moving steadily along the path that led towards the old woods. The king’s son kept to the shadows of the wall, and then among the first trees where they grew close and dark. The king walked on until he came to a small clearing where a stream ran over smooth, grey stones, and there he stopped. The son saw him reach into his cloak and bring out the golden cup, his fingers tracing the silver leaves again. Then, the faint music the son had heard before came again, clearer now, and it seemed to rise from the ground itself near the stream. The very air above the stream shimmered, and the ground where the king stood began to glow faintly, as if heat rose from cold stones. The king did not move, save for a slight turning of his head towards the source of the music. From his place among the trees, the king’s son saw the faint light growing stronger around his father.
Then, out of the glowing earth itself, shapes seemed to rise, slender and pale, and they began to move in a slow dance. The king’s son saw that they wore crowns made of leaves of pure silver, like those on the king’s cup, and these leaves shimmered as they moved. The king stood as still as the stones of the stream, his gaze fixed upon the dancers. There was no sound of instruments, yet the music the son had heard was all around them, guiding the steps of the dance. In their hands, the dancers held small golden cups, like the king’s but more delicate, and they passed them from hand to hand as if sharing a draught of dark wine that smelled of spice and forest. A breath of that strange, spicy scent reached the king’s son where he hid, and a shiver, not of cold, ran through him. The silver leaves of their crowns were the brightest things in the clearing, for the dancers themselves were like shadows, and their feet made no sound on the damp earth. The king took one slow step forward, his dark cloak falling a little open. As he did so, the dancers, as one, all turned their pale faces towards him. And in an instant, like a snuffed candle flame, they were gone, and the light, and the music, as if they had never been.
The king stood alone in the clearing, and slowly lowered the golden cup. The king’s son watched from the trees, and saw that now there was only the stream and the stones, though the faintest scent of spice still hung in the cold air. The king turned and began to walk back towards the castle, his steps not hurried, nor slow. The king’s son retreated deeper into the shadows, and then made his own way back to the castle, his head full of the sight of the silver leaves and the silent dancers. For many days after, the king attended to his duties in the hall, and spoke of laws and harvests as if nothing had occurred. But the king’s son watched him closely, and saw how his father’s eyes would still stray to the golden cup when he thought no one was looking. Then, one afternoon, the king went not to the woods, but to a small cottage at the edge of the city where dwelt an old woman, wise in the lore of herbs and simples. The king’s son, ever curious, followed at a distance and hid himself behind a gnarled apple tree near her gate. He saw the king speak low to the old woman, and she listened, her eyes bright as a bird’s, nodding slowly as the king mentioned silver leaves, and golden cups, and a castle under the ground. At last, the old woman went into her cottage and brought out a cloak, but of a different kind to the king’s own; it was fine and light, the colour of stream water shimmering in shadow, and it felt soft as moonlight when she pressed it into his hands with a few quiet words.
The king took it, with a nod of thanks, and folding it carefully, he departed. The king’s son saw that this new cloak was not heavy like his father’s other cloak, but seemed to catch the light, and he wondered at the few words the old woman had spoken, though he could not catch their meaning. Some nights passed, and the moon grew full, before the king once more took his path to the woods, but this time he wore the cloak given by the old woman. The king’s son followed, and this night the air itself felt different to him, somehow thinner, clearer, with a scent of pine and something like cold stars. When they reached the clearing by the stream, the king once more held his golden cup, and the music began almost at once, clearer and sharper than before. The pale dancers rose from the earth, and this time, to the king’s son, they seemed more solid, their silver leaf-crowns brighter, almost casting their own light. And the king, this time, did not only watch, but with the new cloak swirling around him like water touched by moonlight, he stepped forward into the very circle of the dance. The dancers did not vanish; instead, their pale faces turned to him, and as if he were one of them, they made a space for him, and the dance flowed around him. The king’s son watched, holding his breath, as his father moved among them, his steps grave and slow, his own dark, heavy cloak visible beneath the shimmering light one. For a long time they danced, or so it seemed to the son, and then, as the first hint of dawn touched the sky, the music faded, and one of them pressed a single silver leaf into the king’s hand before they all dissolved like mist.
The king stood with the silver leaf in his palm, the light cloak from the old woman still clinging to him as if made of air and water. The king’s son saw his father look at the leaf for a long moment, and noticed that this time the golden cup was not in his father’s other hand; it must have been left in the folds of the heavier cloak now discarded on the ground. Then the king carefully folded the light cloak from the old woman around the silver leaf, as if it were the most precious jewel in his kingdom. He picked up his old, heavy cloak, and with the smaller, lighter one held carefully beneath it, he made his way back to the castle with a new quietness about him that the son had not seen before. In his own chamber, the king spread out the light cloak upon his table and laid the silver leaf upon it, and he sat looking at them for many hours, thinking of the dancers and the words of the old woman concerning a castle under the ground. The king’s son, too, found himself drawn to the great hall, to the place where the empty golden cup now sat upon a side table, untouched. He reached out a finger and touched the silver leaves carved upon it, and for a moment, he thought he heard the faintest echo of the dancers' music. As he stood there, a shadow fell over him, and he turned to see the old woman from the cottage standing silently in the doorway of the great hall. She looked not at the cup, but at the king’s son, and said, 'The light cloak shows the path to the silver leaves, but the true key to the castle under the ground is not woven of moonlight, but carried in the heart that remembers its own song.' Before the king’s son could ask what she meant by such a riddle, she had turned and vanished as silently as a moth at dusk.
That very night, the king, holding the silver leaf which now pulsed with a soft light of its own, went to the woods, but deeper this time, beyond the clearing of the dancers. The king’s son, remembering the old woman’s riddle about a heart that remembers its own song, also went forth, but he carried no cloak of power, only a quiet attention in his mind. The king followed the glow of the silver leaf until it led him to an ancient oak, its branches like grasping arms against the moon, and here the leaf shone so brightly it was almost painful to behold. When the king touched the trunk of the oak with the silver leaf, the bark seemed to grow transparent, and within, faintly glowing stairs could be seen leading down into the earth. The king’s son, who had wandered, listening to that quiet pull in his chest, also found himself before the same ancient oak, though he saw no stairs, only the solid wood. The king, his face set in lines of grim purpose, took a deep breath and, without hesitation, stepped onto the first stair and began to descend into the gloom. The king’s son, feeling the faint music grow stronger within him, also reached out and touched the ancient bark, thinking not of leaves of silver, but of the melody in his heart, and for him too, the way down became clear. He too began to descend the glowing stairs, and the air grew cool and still around him, carrying the scent of old stone and something like forgotten wine. At the foot of the stairs, they found themselves in a vast hall, lit by no torch but by the silver leaves on the garments of silent figures who stood all around, like statues wrought of moonlight and sorrow, each crowned with the same shimmering foliage. And in the center, upon a throne of dark, unpolished stone, sat a queen, her face turned slightly aside, the very image of the carving on the king’s golden cup, her silver crown identical to those of the silent dancers who were her court.
