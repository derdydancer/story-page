The Honest Spoon
There was once a merchant named Bartholomew who was exceedingly rich, but his heart was as hard and false as a lead coin painted gold. He cheated his customers, lied to his neighbours, and thought only of adding more coins to his overflowing chests. He ate fine food from silver plates, but cared naught for the poor folk who had barely a crust.
One day, travelling through a strange village far from his home, he saw an old pedlar sitting by the roadside. Before the pedlar lay a dusty cloth with a few odds and ends: a tarnished buckle, three bent nails, and a single spoon made of dark, dull wood. The merchant, always looking for a bargain he could twist to his advantage, scoffed. "What rubbish have you there, old man?"
The pedlar looked up, his eyes oddly bright. "Only what you see, master. But this spoon," he said, picking up the wooden spoon, "is worth more than you might think."
Bartholomew laughed. "That plain thing? I would not give you a copper for it."
"Perhaps not," said the pedlar softly. "But it has a virtue. He who eats with this spoon must speak only the truth."
The merchant’s eyes narrowed. A truth-telling spoon? What nonsense! But a cunning thought sparked in his mind. Such a spoon, if it truly worked, could be used to ferret out secrets, to expose rivals! He haggled fiercely, thinking the old man a fool, and finally bought the spoon for a single silver coin he claimed was his last (though his purse was heavy).
Returning home, Bartholomew invited his chief trading rival, a man named Justus whom he suspected of hiding a profitable venture, to supper. He laid the table with his finest silver, but placed the plain wooden spoon at Justus’s setting. "A simple spoon, from my travels," he said smoothly. "Use it, I pray you."
Justus picked up the spoon, looking puzzled, but began to eat the rich stew. Bartholomew leaned forward, his eyes gleaming. "Tell me, friend Justus," he began, "is it true you have found a new source of rare spices in the South?"
Justus opened his mouth, intending to deny it as he always did, but instead, the words tumbled out: "Aye, Bartholomew, it is true! A whole island, untouched! The profits will be immense, far greater than yours!" He clapped his hand over his mouth, aghast.
Bartholomew was delighted! It worked! But then Justus, still holding the spoon, looked at him sharply. "And is it true, Bartholomew," he asked, his voice trembling with anger and the spoon's compulsion, "that you bribed the harbour master to delay my ships last spring?"
Bartholomew opened his mouth to laugh it off, but the spoon’s magic, even from across the table, seemed to catch him. "Yes!" he heard himself declare loudly. "And I switched your cargo manifests too!"
The dinner ended in shouting and threats. Justus stormed out, vowing revenge and promising to reveal Bartholomew’s deceit to the whole town. The merchant was furious. The spoon was too dangerous!
He tried to throw it away, tossing it into the river. But the next morning, it lay gleaming wetly on his doorstep. He tried to burn it, but the flames would not touch the dark wood. He tried to bury it deep in his garden, but the following day, his cook found it sitting innocently in the soup ladle.
The spoon clung to him. And worse, its influence grew. He found himself blurting out truths at the market, admitting he watered the wine and used false weights. He confessed his dishonest deals to the town council. His wife learned of his secret debts, his servants learned how little he truly valued them, and the beggars learned he had vaults full of gold he denied possessing.
Soon, no one would trade with him. His rivals united to ruin him. His false friends deserted him. Stripped of his wealth and reputation, Bartholomew the merchant became Bartholomew the beggar, clothed in rags, shunned by all. He owned nothing in the world but the simple wooden spoon, which now lay unused, for he had no food to eat with it, and having lost everything, he found he had no lies left to tell. He lived out his days in miserable poverty, a stark warning that ill-gotten gains built on falsehood cannot endure the simple touch of truth.
