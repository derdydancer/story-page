The Prince, the Queen, and the Secret Flame
There was once a kingdom ruled by a Queen whose heart was said to be made of winter. She had a son, the prince, who was very clever and watched all that passed in the court. In this kingdom, the palace gardens were always white with frost, even in the hottest summer. The prince would walk there sometimes and strike the frozen flowers with a small stone to see the icicles shatter. Many princes came seeking the Queen's favour or hand, but none could please her, and most went away sorrowful or vanished altogether. The prince saw all this, spoke no word, but marked it well in his mind. At feasts, the Queen demanded musicians play on instruments carved from ice, though often they melted or shattered before a tune was done. So the prince gave the musicians special gloves lined with straw, which helped somewhat. The Queen noticed the music lasted longer but said naught to her son. And so things went on in that kingdom, always cold, and the prince always watching.
One day messengers came to the court, telling of a kingdom nearby that was scorched by unnatural heat and lacked water. The Queen heard this news, but her face showed nothing. The prince, however, thought on this news carefully. He went to the Queen and spoke thus, 'Mother, let us send cartloads of ice from our gardens to the suffering kingdom as a sign of goodwill.' The Queen waved a hand, saying, 'The ice is endless here; do as you will with it.' So the servants set to work chopping blocks from the frozen gardens, but the ice was hard as stone and slippery as glass, and many fell down. The prince watched, gave commands for using sharp axes carefully, and showed them how to wrap the blocks in thick furs. At last, ten carts were filled with great blocks of ice, and they set off on the road. The prince rode with them, not at the head of the convoy, but quietly behind with two attendants. They travelled for many days, a strange sight, the carts shedding mist in the warm air as the ice slowly wept.
When they reached the neighbouring kingdom, the earth was cracked open, the plants were withered brown, and the people sat listlessly in the shade. At first, none believed their eyes when the carts of ice arrived, but then great cries went up as folk crowded round to feel the wonderful cold. Their king came forth from his palace, pale and weak, and gave great thanks, offering gold and jewels to the leader of the convoy. The prince watched from nearby and saw the king's weakness and the people's eagerness for the ice. The ice was quickly shared out; some tried to hoard chips, others cooled water, and certain foolish nobles built seats of ice but soon sat in puddles. The prince told his men only to ensure the ice was shared fairly among the villages and to take no payment but the king's thanks. For a short time, the melted ice made small streams flow again, the people breathed easier, and the plants looked less weary. Whilst his men worked, the prince spoke quietly to an old farmer and asked how long the drought had plagued them and if its cause was known. The farmer sighed and said the drought began years ago when their king broke a promise to a sorcerer dwelling in the eastern mountains. The ice now gone and thanks given, the prince and his men took their leave, and he thought much on the farmer's words concerning the sorcerer.
The journey back was swift, for the carts were light now and rattled loudly on the stones. They reached the palace once more, where the gardens glittered white with frost under the pale sun. He went before the Queen and told how the ice was welcomed and gave account of the neighbouring king's thanks. The Queen listened with a still face and nodded her head only when he was finished speaking. But the prince, walking later in the gardens, noticed a patch of ground near the Queen's own tower where the frost seemed thinner, and one ice rose dripped water. Later, when none watched, the prince went to that place and looked closely at the ground and touched the dripping rose. He found there, frozen fast within the ice near the rose's stem, a single dark feather like that of a raven or crow. He chipped the feather carefully from the ice, took it with him, and thought long on how it came to be there. In the palace kitchens, the cooks had learned to bake bread in special pans lined with sheepskin so that it might stay warm till midday. The prince ate this bread for his supper, looked out at the white gardens, and kept the dark feather hidden in his chamber.
The prince decided he must look within the Queen's tower to understand the meaning of the dripping rose and the dark feather. But the tower stood tall and smooth, with no door below, and windows set high up made of thick, frosted glass. For three days the prince watched, and saw how a silent servant brought the Queen's food, tapped thrice on the stone base, and caught a rope ladder that fell from above. When the servant departed on the third day, the prince crept forth, tapped thrice upon the stone, and climbed the ladder swiftly when it fell. Inside, the air was not cold but still, and the room was dimly lit, filled with many small cages wherein sleeping dark birds sat silent on their perches. In the very centre of the room stood a great golden cage, and within it perched no bird, but rather a small, steady flame that burned warmly. The prince looked long at the flame, then at the sleeping birds, and then he understood the Queen's secret. Even as he watched, a tiny spark flew from the golden cage, landed on a nearby cage of iron wire, and instantly frost covered the bars white, and the bird within grew utterly still. He stepped back carefully then, left the tower as he came, knowing that the secret flame was the heart of all power in the kingdom. He returned to his duties in the palace, walked in the frosty gardens, and gave no sign of what he had found within the tower.
From that day, the prince began sometimes to leave a single dark feather on the Queen's path, or near her chair at table, watching her face when she saw them. The Queen saw these feathers; her face did not change, but she ordered the palace corridors to be swept twice each day thereafter. Soon, messengers came once more from the neighbouring kingdom, saying the ice had melted long ago, the drought was returning, and begging for more help. The prince heard this and thought again of the farmer's words concerning the sorcerer in the eastern mountains. He spoke to the Queen again, saying, 'Sending ice gives only brief comfort; let me travel now to seek out this sorcerer, perhaps to make peace and keep our own borders safe.' The Queen consented with a slow nod and spoke one command: 'Deal with the heat there if you must, but bring no uncontrolled fire back into my kingdom.' The prince made ready for this journey, taking few weapons but carrying maps, inks, and the dark feather carefully wrapped in silk. He rode out from the palace gates alone, turning east towards the mountains where the farmer said the sorcerer dwelt. As he passed through a thin wood, he saw three squirrels pushing vainly at a great round stone, chattering and arguing over the best way to roll it uphill. The prince watched them a moment, shook his head slightly, and rode on towards the mountains, for he had greater matters at hand.
After many days riding, he found the sorcerer's dwelling in the mountains, not a cave, but a tall tower made of sun-baked clay from which heat shimmered. An old man came forth from the tower door, his skin like cracked earth and his eyes like burning coals that radiated heat. The sorcerer demanded in a voice like dry wind, 'Why come you here? I punish that foolish king who broke his word, and his land suffers justly.' The prince spoke calmly, not of pleas but of balance, telling of his Queen and her land of ice, and for a moment he let the sorcerer glimpse the dark feather. The sorcerer's burning eyes flickered as he saw the feather, and he fell silent a moment, the heat around him wavering. Then the prince said, 'Let there be a truce; lessen your heat that rain may fall, and I shall see that the king makes amends, perhaps with a gift of a single perfect ice rose from my mother's garden.' The sorcerer agreed slowly, 'So be it, if amends are truly made; but beware, young prince, playing games with ice and fire.' And as he spoke, clouds began to gather over the mountain peaks, and the fierce heat lessened a little. The prince gave a slight bow, departed the tower, and left the sorcerer standing alone in the lessening heat. He rode back towards the kingdoms, carrying the sorcerer's warning, the knowledge of the secret flame, and now, perhaps, influence over both fire and ice.
