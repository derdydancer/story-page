Lazy Leo and the Sky-Root
Leo was quite possibly the laziest man in the Seven Valleys. He lived in a tumbledown hut at the edge of the village, and his greatest ambition was to find a way to lie in the sun all day without needing to work for his supper. His scrap of garden was overgrown with weeds, save for one corner where his tired old mother had, years ago, planted a single, stubborn bean seed of a variety no one quite remembered. Leo mostly ignored it.
One spring morning, Leo was lying on his back, watching the clouds, and idly tossed a bucket of dirty dishwater out the door. Much of it landed, by chance, on the forgotten bean plant's corner. Leo yawned and went back to his nap.
He awoke later that afternoon to a strange scraping sound. He looked out. A thick, green vine, thicker than his arm, was climbing rapidly up the side of his hut, already reaching the roof. It had burst from the spot where the bean seed lay.
"Well, that's odd," thought Leo, mildly interested. "Must have been thirsty." He went back to sleep.
The next morning, the vine towered over his hut, reaching high into the sky, so high he couldn't see the top. It looked less like a beanstalk and more like a gnarled, green root growing downwards *from* the sky. Birds were perching on its side-shoots.
"Hmm," Leo mused, scratching his head. "Might be cooler up there." Laziness, rather than courage or curiosity, prompted him. He grabbed hold of the rough bark of the Sky-Root, as he decided to call it, and began to climb. It was surprisingly easy; the knobs and side-shoots made perfect handholds.
He climbed for what seemed like hours, passing through the clouds. Above the clouds, the Sky-Root emerged into dazzling sunlight. It didn't end, but seemed to spread out, forming a sort of vast, green, upside-down forest canopy high above. And hanging from the smaller tendrils were not leaves, but... biscuits! Golden-brown, perfectly baked biscuits dangled everywhere like fruit.
Leo's eyes widened. He plucked one. It was warm and delicious. He plucked another, and another. He ate his fill, then lay back on a broad, root-like branch, basking in the sun. "This is the life!" he sighed happily. Free food, warm sun, no work.
He stayed up there for three days, eating biscuits and sleeping. He noticed other things hanging from the Sky-Root: occasionally a waterskin filled with cool, clear water, sometimes a pouch of roasted nuts, once even a small cooked chicken. It seemed the Sky-Root provided everything needed for a lazy existence.
On the fourth day, however, he saw something else climbing the Sky-Root from below. It was Grumbald, the Mayor's stout and greedy son, who was famous for always wanting what others had. Grumbald had seen the giant root from the village and, driven by envy and ambition, had decided to climb it himself.
"Ho there, Lazy Leo!" Grumbald puffed as he reached Leo's level. "What's this place? Have you found treasure?" He saw the biscuits. "Biscuits! Growing on a root! I'll claim this Sky-Root for my father!"
Grumbald started grabbing biscuits greedily, stuffing his pockets. He tried to pull down a whole branch laden with them. But the Sky-Root seemed... displeased. The branch Grumbald tugged suddenly writhed like a snake, slapping him hard across the face. The biscuits he had stuffed in his pockets turned instantly to hard, inedible pebbles.
"Ouch! Hey!" yelled Grumbald. He kicked the root in anger.
The Sky-Root shuddered. The branch Leo was lying on dipped alarmingly. Far below, the ground seemed impossibly distant.
"Don't make it angry!" Leo yelped, clinging on. He wasn't brave, just concerned for his comfortable napping spot.
But Grumbald, furious at being denied, drew a small axe he had brought and began hacking at a smaller dangling root from which hung a plump waterskin. "I'll take what I want!" he snarled.
The moment the axe struck, the entire Sky-Root gave a mighty shudder. A deep groan echoed through the air. The root Grumbald was hacking at recoiled violently, striking him squarely in the chest and sending him tumbling off into the empty blue sky with a surprised yell. They never saw him again.
The Sky-Root then began to *pull itself up*. The massive root slowly, steadily, withdrew back into the sky from whence it came. Leo clung on desperately as his perch was drawn higher and higher. Finally, the very tip of the root lifted from his garden patch below, leaving only a shallow hole. The Sky-Root vanished completely back above the clouds.
Leo found himself deposited gently not back in his garden, but on a soft cloud bank. The Sky-Root was gone. There were no more biscuits. He was alone, high above the world.
"Oh dear," thought Leo. "This requires effort."
He eventually found his way down by jumping from cloud to cloud (which were surprisingly bouncy) and finally sliding down a long sunbeam when the clouds parted, landing with a soft thump in a haystack miles from his home.
He had to walk back to his village, which took two whole days – more work than he'd done in years. He arrived tired, hungry, and biscuit-less. The hole where the Sky-Root had been was just a hole. His hut looked even more tumbledown.
Leo sighed. It seemed his perfect lazy life was unattainable. With no Sky-Root biscuits, he realised he would actually have to weed his garden if he wanted to eat. He picked up a hoe. It felt terribly heavy. But the memory of falling from the sky, and the thought of having absolutely nothing to eat, was motivation enough. Leo, the laziest man in the Seven Valleys, actually began to work. Just a little bit.
