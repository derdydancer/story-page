The Wanderings of a Copper Penny
Once upon a time, there was a copper penny. It was new made, all shiny and bright. An old woman got the penny first; she dwelt near the town and sold herbs. She earned the penny and thought, "With this, I will buy a ribbon for my granddaughter on the morrow." The penny felt it was meant for good things.
But as the old woman walked home, the day nigh spent, alas, the penny slipped from a hole in her old pouch. It fell onto the dusty road, and she knew naught of it.
So the penny lay in the dust. It could not be spent, and it was sad. Soon, a rich merchant came by in his carriage. A wheel struck the penny and tossed it up, so it landed inside the carriage, near the merchant's boot. The penny thought, "Now I shall be used."
Then the merchant saw the penny. "Bah, small change," said he, and tossed it into his great purse. Gold coins and silver coins dwelt there, and the penny felt small amongst them. When the merchant bought fine silk, he paid with gold. When he bought wine, he paid with silver. The penny was not used at all, but just rattled about. At last, the merchant grew tired of the weight of small coins. He came to the city gate where he saw a beggar sitting. The merchant threw the penny, and some others like it, to the poor man.
"Perhaps the poor need me more," thought the penny as it landed in the beggar's rough hand. The beggar looked at the few coins. He bought a hard crust of bread with two pennies, and kept our penny clutched tight in his hand. "He holds me dear," thought the penny. But that night, the beggar slept in a cold alley. Then came a thief, quiet as a mouse, and stole the penny from the sleeping beggar's hand.
The penny wished it could cry out, "Stop, thief!" But it was only metal. The thief hurried away and used the penny, with others he had stolen, to pay a ship captain. The ship was sailing to distant lands across the wide world. So the penny went into the captain's pocket. It thought, "Now I shall see adventure."
But the sea journey was hard. A great storm came, and the waves rose like mountains. The captain leaned over the side of the ship. Then the penny slipped from his pocket and fell down, down into the dark, churning sea.
"Lost! I am lost!" thought the penny. It sank to the sea bottom, where it lay among the sand and the waving seaweed. Many a time did the sun rise and set, and years went by. The penny grew dull and turned green like moss. Crabs crawled over it, and fish swam past. It seemed its use was gone forever.
Then one day, another great storm raged. It stirred the sea from its deepest parts. A strong current lifted the penny and tossed it this way and that, hither and thither. At last, the current threw the penny onto the shore, where it landed among the pebbles and shells on a lonely beach, far away.
Presently, a youth came walking along the beach. He was the son of a poor fisherman, looking for firewood. His eye fell upon a dull green thing among the stones. He picked it up and rubbed it hard. Then he saw the faint shape of the king's head.
"A coin!" cried he. "An old coin!" He had never held a coin before in his life, so he clutched it tight. "He sees me!" thought the penny, feeling a little bit important again.
The youth ran home as quick as lightning to the little hut made of driftwood. His mother, a poor widow, was inside. "Look, Mother!" he shouted. "I found treasure!"
His mother took the penny, and her eyes filled with tears. "Oh, my child," said she. "This copper piece... it is just enough. The trader in the village has one small spool of good thread. With this coin, I can buy it. Then I can mend your father's old fishing net. We shall have fish, and we shall not hunger this winter." She greatly rejoiced.
So the mother took the penny to the village trader. She gave him the coin, and he gave her the good thread. The trader tossed the old penny into a clay jar with other worn coins.
The penny did not mind being with the others now. It had travelled the wide world. It had seen rich men and poor men. It had been stolen and lost in the deep sea. But at last, it had come where it was needed most. It had bought thread to mend a net; it had brought hope. Its journey was long, but its purpose was met. And in the trader's dusty jar, the copper penny rested, dull but content to its heart's content. And perhaps it rests there still.
