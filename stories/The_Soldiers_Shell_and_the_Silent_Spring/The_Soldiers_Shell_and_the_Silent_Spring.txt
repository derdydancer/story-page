The Soldier's Shell and the Silent Spring
A soldier, who had fought in a long war, was at last walking the weary road towards his home. He carried little else but a strange conch shell, which he had found on a distant shore after a great battle. He had learned its secret, and knew that if he whispered into its smooth opening, his words would travel to any ear he intended, no matter how far. Another treasure he kept was an empty bottle of dark glass, taken from a fallen sorcerer. This bottle, if uncorked and directed towards a sound, would capture it within, and hold it until the stopper was pulled again to release the noise. So he journeyed towards his own kingdom, where a good king ruled, but this king had a great sorrow. His only son, a handsome youth, had been changed by a cruel enchantment into the grievous form of a beast. This son now roamed as a great grey wolf in the dark forest bordering the kingdom. The king had learned from a wise woman that the spell could only be broken if the wolf was kissed willingly by a maiden who knew his plight. But though many had tried, or been urged, all had fled in terror upon seeing the great wolf.
Now, in this same kingdom, there dwelt a poor woodcutter who had a wicked wife and a gentle stepdaughter. The stepdaughter was kind and diligent, and bore her harsh life with patience. Her stepmother often sent her into the dark forest to gather firewood, with scant food for the day. While there, she would often share her small crust of bread with the little birds, or speak softly to the shy deer. One evening, as dusk fell and the shadows grew long, the great grey wolf stepped onto her path. She did not scream nor run, but only looked at the beast with wide eyes. The wolf, too, stood still, and looked at her with its great, sorrowful eyes. Then, she slowly held out the last piece of her bread towards the silent creature. The wolf stepped forward, and took it softly from her hand, and did not frighten her at all. From that day on, they often met in this way, and she would save a part of her meal for her strange, silent friend.
After many weeks of travel, the soldier with the conch shell and the bottle arrived at the chief city of that kingdom, and soon heard tales of the king's sorrow. He thought he might find service with the king, and so sought an audience at the palace. The king, being much gripped by his grief and willing to hear any counsel, granted the soldier entry, and spoke not only of the wolf, but also of a second, hidden enchantment tied to the first. "'For,' said the king, 'since my son was changed, the great spring that feeds our city from the mountains has begun to fail, its waters dwindling each year.' 'The same wise woman foretold that only when my son regains his true form will the spring's full strength return to us.' The soldier then spoke of his conch shell, and offered to send a message to all corners of the land, seeking a maiden brave enough for such a task. The king agreed with great hope, and the soldier whispered the king's plea and the wolf's condition into the shell, so all eligible maidens might hear it. Far away in the forest, as she shared her crust with the great wolf, the words of the king echoed faintly in the stepdaughter's ear. She understood then that her forest companion was none other than the lost prince, suffering under that cruel spell. She looked at the wolf with new eyes of pity and resolve, though she said naught of what she had heard.
The soldier remained at court, and the king, much impressed by the conch's power, asked about the dark glass bottle the soldier also carried. The soldier explained its nature, and to show its virtue, he uncorked it towards the courtyard and captured the sharp bark of a distant dog. The king was greatly intrigued and said, 'Perhaps this bottle could capture the sound of the silent stones of our dwindling spring, or what it once was.' So they went to the place of the great spring, and the soldier held the bottle towards the rocks whence the water usually gushed, capturing the faint sound of its weak trickle. Then, the soldier took his conch, and whispered a question to the high mountains, asking if any old hermit or spirit of the peaks remembered the spring's mighty voice of old. An answer returned through the shell, the thin voice of an ancient mountain spirit, describing a roar like a great waterfall, a music that made the stones themselves sing. And as this voice spoke from the conch, the soldier cleverly held his dark bottle near the shell's opening, and captured that very description of the lost, powerful sound. "'Now, Lord King,' said the soldier, 'I have its lost voice here, captured from the spirit's memory.' He then took the king back to the dwindling spring, and there uncorked the bottle, releasing the captured sound of its own forgotten, mighty roar of water. As the memory of its own glorious voice echoed among the rocks, the stones seemed to tremble, and the flow of water pulsed a little stronger from that moment.
The stepdaughter, hearing also of the spring's partial revival and knowing the full story, felt that duty and compassion urged her towards a difficult path. She went into the forest the next day, not merely to share her bread, but with a clear purpose. When the great wolf appeared, she looked into his sorrowful eyes and said, 'I know who you are, poor Prince.' The wolf whined softly and its great ears flattened for a moment, as if in surprise or fear. "'And I am not afraid,' she continued, 'and I will kiss you now, if you will allow it, to break this wicked spell.' The great wolf did not move, but only lowered its great head a little, as if in assent. So the brave stepdaughter closed her eyes, and leaned forward, and kissed the rough fur on the wolf's broad brow. As her lips touched him, the wolf shuddered violently, a bright light surrounded it, and then before her stood the handsome prince, whole and restored. "'You have saved me,' said the prince, his voice filled with wonder, 'kindest and bravest of maidens!' And far away, yet at that very instant, the great spring in the king's city burst forth with a joyful roar, its waters plentiful and sweet once more.
The prince took the stepdaughter's hand, and they resolved to return to the palace without delay. At the court, the soldier was much honored for the spring's surprising improvement, though none knew its true, deeper cause. Then swift messengers arrived, telling of the spring's full miraculous flow, and that the prince was alive, restored, and returning with a maiden. The king wept with joy and ordered a great feast, but also, in his prudence, asked the soldier if his conch or bottle might reveal who this rescuing maiden truly was before she arrived. The soldier, with a strange look, said his bottle could not hear thoughts, but if one spoke their honest story near its mouth, the bottle would hold the true echo of their past words and deeds, separate from any present falsehood. The king, eager to know all, commanded that when the prince and maiden arrived, she should tell her tale with the soldier's bottle held nigh, to affirm her virtue. Soon, the prince and the stepdaughter entered the great hall to much rejoicing, and the prince declared her the one who had broken his cruel enchantment. The king then, praising her courage, gently requested she recount her brave deeds, while the soldier stood by, holding his dark bottle with its stopper loosened. The stepdaughter, in a clear, soft voice, told of her encounters in the forest, the sharing of her bread, her knowledge of the king's message, and the final, fearful kiss. When she finished, the soldier quickly stoppered the bottle, but then, to the court's amazement, he uncorked it again and from it came not her voice, but the sharp, cruel words of her stepmother, recorded days before, plotting to claim she herself had saved the prince by a feigned act of bravery.
A great astonishment fell upon the court as they heard the wicked words and the false claim being planned by the stepmother's own voice. The stepmother, who had come to court hoping for some reward for her 'daughter's' deed, grew pale and could not utter a word in her defense. The king, in a stern voice, then banished the wicked stepmother from his lands forever for her deceitful heart and intended treachery. Then all eyes turned to the true stepdaughter, whose quiet virtue now shone all the brighter. The prince then asked the king for her hand in marriage, which was granted with tears of joy and much blessing. The soldier too was rewarded with gold and lands, and a fine black horse with a silver-stitched saddle, for his unique services to the crown. It was said that the soldier's new horse would nuzzle his hand and follow him like a dog, just as the stepdaughter had shown unwavering faith to the prince in his beastly form, never fearing his fangs but seeing the soul within. Great preparations were made for the wedding, and the whole kingdom rejoiced, for the prince was restored and the great spring flowed mightily again. The stepdaughter, though adorned in silks and jewels, still found time to walk in the palace gardens and feed the small birds from her hand. The soldier, now a lord with his own lands, often rode his fine black horse through the city, and many remarked on the creature's keen understanding of its master's slightest wish.
But, as happiness is often fleeting without further trial, a messenger arrived from a stern, neighboring king, full of envy for the kingdom's renewed fortunes. This envious king declared that unless the bride-to-be could perform three tasks of his devising, he would take it as a sign of weakness and wage war upon the land. "'First,' read the messenger from a scroll, 'she must weave a tapestry by sunrise that shows the entire history of the wind, from its first whisper at the dawn of time to the sigh it makes in the leaves today.' Great dismay filled the court, for no mortal skill could achieve such a thing, yet the stepdaughter, though troubled, did not weep. The soldier then approached her and said quietly, 'Perhaps my conch shell can hear more than just words meant for ears; perhaps it can hear the wind's own story.' So that night, as the stepdaughter sat pale before a vast, empty loom, the soldier stood by an open window, holding the conch shell outwards to the silent, listening sky. Slowly, the shell began to hum, not with words, but with faint, ancient melodies, the sighing of primeval gales, and the whispers of breezes through long-vanished forests. And as these ancient sounds filled the room, threads of many colours flew from unseen spools to the loom, and began to weave themselves into patterns of air and motion. By sunrise, a magnificent tapestry hung there, shimmering with the whole story of the wind, from its birth among the stars to its dance upon the morning dew, all miraculously wrought. The envious king's messenger, upon seeing it, was struck dumb with astonishment, and could not deny its wonder nor its completion.
"'For the second task,' announced the grim messenger, 'your princess must bring to my king, by the next sunrise, a crystal vial filled with the tears of a dragon, shed willingly.' This caused even greater fear, for dragons were creatures of fire and wrath, not sorrow, and none knew where such a beast might be found, let alone made to weep. The stepdaughter's gentle face was etched with sadness at this cruel demand, but the soldier, seeing her grief, came to her with his dark glass bottle held ready. "'Fear not, noble maiden,' he said, 'for long ago, when you suffered much at your stepmother's hand and thought no one saw, I once captured the sound of your own innocent, heartfelt weeping in the deep woods.' "'If we can find a dragon's lair,' he proposed, 'perhaps the sound of such true and undeserved grief, played from this bottle, might touch even a dragon's heart to pity.' He then used his conch once more, and a trembling air-spirit, after much pleading, whispered the location of a reclusive dragon's lair high in the fire-scarred peaks. The soldier, commending the stepdaughter to the prince's care, mounted his brave black horse and rode swiftly towards that perilous place, the precious bottle secured at his side. He found the great dragon, scaled in obsidian and breathing plumes of acrid smoke, sleeping fitfully before its cave; and with a steady hand, he unstoppered the bottle, releasing the soft, heartbreaking sound of the maiden's long-ago tears. The dragon awoke with a start, smoke snorting from its nostrils like a startled bull, but as the genuine sorrow filled the air, its great eye, usually like molten gold, seemed to film with a strange moisture, its jagged jaw trembling slightly, much like a hound that hears its lost master's call from afar. Then, a single, huge, glistening tear welled and fell from its eye, and the soldier, darting forward with the crystal vial the princess had given him, caught it deftly before riding away as fast as his black horse could carry him, the task complete.
Just as the sun's first rays touched the highest tower, the soldier returned to the court, presenting the vial with the single, shimmering dragon's tear to the astonished king. The envious king's messenger, his face sour, confirmed the second success, then announced the third task: 'By tomorrow's dawn, she must count truly every grain of sand upon the king's longest sea-shore, and deliver the number written.' At this, true despair was seen on the stepdaughter's face, for the shore was vast and the sands countless as the stars. Even the clever soldier looked downcast, for his conch could not speak with sand, nor could his bottle capture a number not yet known. But the prince, who loved her dearly, knelt by her side and said, 'Dearest, you have shown kindness to all creatures; perhaps the smallest beings of the shore might aid you now, if we ask.' So they went to the vast sea-shore, and the stepdaughter knelt upon the sand and called out softly, not with a command, but with a gentle plea, to the ants and the tiny crabs and all the little burrowing creatures of the beach. And in answer to her voice, an innumerable host of tiny shore-creatures emerged from the sand; the ants formed lines like diligent scribes, the little crabs used their claws like abacus beads on strands of seaweed, and sandpipers made quick, precise marks with their beaks, each taking a tiny section of the beach to assess. All through the moonlit night they toiled, a silent, rustling army, while the stepdaughter, the prince, and even the soldier watched from the dunes in breathless wonder. As the first hint of dawn touched the waves, a single, wise-looking old ant crawled onto her hand and, with a faint buzz, seemed to whisper one single, immense number into her waiting ear. The stepdaughter quickly wrote this number upon a smooth piece of driftwood with a charred stick, her heart light with gratitude, the final task done.
At sunrise, the envious king's messenger returned, a smirk upon his lips, certain that this last demand had surely been too great for any mortal. The stepdaughter, with quiet dignity, handed him the piece of driftwood whereon was written the single, astonishingly long number. The messenger stared, his jaw agape, for though he had no way to count them himself, the clear confidence in her eyes, and the memory of the two prior wonders, left him no room for doubt. He departed shamefaced to his master, who, upon hearing of this third marvel, knew his ill-intent was thwarted and dared not speak of war again. And so, the wedding of the prince and the good stepdaughter took place, and it was the greatest feast the kingdom had ever known, lasting seven days and seven nights. The brave soldier, now a high lord, sat at a place of honor, his dark bottle and gleaming conch shell resting on the table before him as symbols of his aid. The prince's own faithful grey charger, which had stayed near him even in his wolf-days in the forest, was led into the feasting hall, its mane braided with ribbons of gold. And just as that noble beast had shown its master steadfast devotion through dark times, so too did the people of the kingdom now pledge their unwavering loyalty to their wise prince and his virtuous princess. The new princess did not forget her old father, the woodcutter, but brought him to the palace to live in comfort and peace for all his remaining days. The kingdom flourished as never before, for the prince ruled with wisdom gained from suffering, and the princess with a compassion that touched every heart, and the great spring sang its joyful song day and night.
Many years passed in peace and plenty, and the soldier, now an old man and chief advisor to the king, decided upon a final use for his wondrous gifts. With his conch, he gathered the memories and true spoken words of the prince, the princess, the old mountain spirit, and even the king himself, concerning the days of the enchantment and the trials. Each of these true accounts, clear and unblemished by time, he then carefully directed into his dark glass bottle, layering sound upon sound within its depths. This bottle, now holding what he called the 'Great Chronicle of Sounds,' he presented to the Royal Scribe to be kept safe in the deepest vault of the king's library. And it is said that to this very day, if one holds an ear most carefully to that ancient, dark glass, one can still hear it faintly hum with all those voices of trial, and of courage, and of love long past. The soldier's black horse, grown grey about the muzzle, served him faithfully to the end of its long days, always responding to his gentlest touch. Thus it can be seen how a shared crust of bread, or a captured sound of sorrow, may set great changes in motion far beyond their first intent. The prince and princess had many good children, who grew tall and fair, and often listened to the wonders held within the Chronicle of Sounds. And so the soldier, who came from war with but two strange treasures, lived out his days in honor, his story and his gifts becoming a legend in that happy land. They all lived content and in great joy for many long years, and if they have not left off their happiness, they are living there still.
