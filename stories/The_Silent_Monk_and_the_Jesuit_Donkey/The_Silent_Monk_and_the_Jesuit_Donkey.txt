The Silent Monk and the Jesuit Donkey
There was once a monk who dwelt in a quiet monastery, and though he could speak quite well when alone, he uttered no word when any other soul was near. In his small cell, his only companion was a talking donkey, which had been schooled by Jesuits and spoke with great learning. Each day the monk performed his duties in silence, while the donkey often quoted learned fathers of the Church or commented on the quality of the hay. One morning, alas, a sacred relic known as the Tear of God, a single drop of crystal kept within the monastery chapel, was found to be missing. The Abbot tore at his hair and wept, and he commanded all monks to search every corner of the holy grounds, but the Tear was nowhere to be found. Then the Abbot, looking upon the silent monk, pointed to him and then towards the wide world outside the monastery gates, making it clear that he, despite his affliction, must seek the lost Tear. The Jesuit donkey then brayed loudly, �And I shall go with him, for who else will speak for you and read the maps, good father Abbot?� and thus it was settled. So, with the Abbot's blessing, but with little food and no money, the monk upon the donkey's back rode out from the monastery into the wide world. After some days, they came to the edge of a dark forest, where the trees grew so thick that the sun dared not to penetrate its gloom. �Hark ye, brother monk,� said the donkey, �the old texts speak of such forests as places where lost souls wander and where the very air is sorrowful; let us be wary.�
The monk, without a word, merely nudged the donkey�s flanks with his heels, and so they entered the shadowed wood. Dry twigs snapped under the donkey�s hooves, and the only other sounds were the cries of unseen birds and a distant rustling in the undergrowth. �Brother,� began the donkey, clearing its throat, �have you ever considered the precise nature of an angel�s locomotion? Is it by volition, or by a continuous act of divine sustentation?� The monk only patted the donkey�s neck and pointed further down the barely visible path, his gaze fixed ahead. Soon they came upon a small, withered wreath of flowers lying on a mossy stone, as if left there long ago and forgotten. �Ah,� sighed the donkey, �like the garland of forsaken Dido, perchance, a testament to love�s sharp ache; a heavy subject, indeed.� The monk dismounted, picked up the wreath, touched it to his brow, and then gently laid it back upon the stone. As they continued, a low moaning sound reached their ears, a sound not of beast nor man, yet full of a deep and abiding pain. The donkey�s ears flattened against its skull and its sturdy legs trembled, but the monk simply made the sign of the cross and pressed onward. They found the source of the sound in a small clearing: a great, magnificent stag with antlers like the branches of an old oak, its leg caught fast in a cruel iron trap.
�By the sainted bones of Ignatius!� cried the donkey, �What manner of godless man would set such an engine of torment for God�s own creatures? This is a grievous sin!� The monk slid from the donkey�s back and, after a moment�s examination of the trap�s mechanism, began to work with his strong hands to pry open its iron jaws. The metal was stubborn and the monk strained, the iron creaking in protest, while the great stag rolled its eyes in fear and snorted plumes of white breath. At last, with a sharp crack, the trap sprang open, and the stag, after looking at the monk for a long moment with its great, dark eyes, bounded away into the trees and was gone. �Well,� observed the donkey, twitching an ear, �one does not often receive a bow or a �thank ye kindly� from such forest nobility, but the deed itself was good.� The monk looked down at his hands, and saw they were scraped and bleeding slightly from his struggle with the iron. Wiping his hands on some moss, the monk remounted the donkey, and they journeyed on as the light began to fail. When darkness fell completely, they sought shelter at the foot of a broad-branched ancient oak, the largest tree they had yet seen. �Our oats are scant, brother,� remarked the donkey as the monk shared the last of their bread, �and this forest offers little hospitality for a discerning palate.� As they settled down, the monk suddenly pointed: through the distant trees, a faint and flickering light, like a single star fallen to earth, could just be seen.
�A hermitage, perhaps?� mused the donkey. �Or some errant will-o�-the-wisp? My studies suggest caution with nocturnal illuminations, yet� curiosity is a powerful spur to scholarship.� The monk nodded, and together they rose and began to make their way cautiously towards the distant gleam. The way was difficult, with thorny bushes that tore at the monk�s robe and tangled roots that tripped the donkey, but the light grew steadily brighter. At last they came to a small clearing, and in its center stood a little hut built of rough logs, with a mossy roof, and the light shone from its single window. Before the monk could reach the door, it creaked open, and an old woman, bent with age but with eyes as keen as a hawk�s, stepped out holding a flickering candle. �Hark, travelers,� she said, her voice like the rustling of dry leaves, �what seek ye so late in this benighted wood, where only shadows and sorrows hold court?� The donkey, bowing its head as much as a donkey can, replied, �Good mother, we are on a holy quest to find the lost Tear of God, stolen from our monastery, and the path has led us hither.� The old woman looked at the silent monk, and then at the talking donkey, for a long time, her keen eyes seeming to pierce through them to their very souls. �The Tear of God, ye say?� she finally rasped. �Well, the night is cold and the wood is full of peril; enter my humble dwelling, but you must ask me three questions, and answer one of mine, ere morning light.� The monk looked at the donkey, who nodded gravely, and so they followed the old woman into the dim, herb-scented interior of the hut.
Inside, bunches of dried herbs hung from the low rafters, strange symbols were painted on the wooden walls, and a single black raven perched on a skull regarded them with one bright eye. The old woman bid them sit on low stools, and she broke a loaf of dark bread for them and poured a bitter, steaming tea from an earthen pot. �Revered mother,� said the donkey, after a sip of the brew that made its whiskers twitch, �concerning these questions: are there any particular subjects forbidden, or any preferred mode of inquiry?� �Ask what you will, so long as your questions are truthful and come from the heart,� the old woman replied, her gaze unsettlingly steady, �for the wind carries away empty words.� The donkey pondered for a moment, then asked, �Good mother, do you know aught of the Tear of God, the sacred relic we seek, or of who might have taken it?� The old woman smiled, a slow, knowing smile. �The Tear of God,� she said, �is born from the sorrow of the world, and can only be held by a heart that has forgotten how to weep for others.� �A weighty thought, indeed,� the donkey conceded, then pressed on, �Our second question, then: is there a path through this accursed forest that does not lead to despair or the dens of ravenous wolves?� �All paths in any forest are the same, little brother,� she replied, stirring her pot, �fear finds wolves at every shadow, but faith finds hidden springs even amongst barren rocks.� Then the monk, who had been silent as the stone floor, slowly raised a hand, pointed to his own mouth, then to his heart, and looked at the old woman with an expression of profound inquiry and sorrow. The old woman�s eyes softened for the first time. �The silent tongue,� she whispered, �is often payment for a broken vow, or for a word that once unleashed innocent blood upon the earth.�
Hearing this, the monk grew so pale that his skin seemed like parchment, and the hand he had raised trembled violently before he slowly lowered it to his lap. �Heavy truths for a heavy heart,� the old woman murmured, then her keen eyes sharpened again. �Now, your three questions are answered; it is time for mine.� She leaned forward, her voice dropping low, �Tell me, travelers: if God is all good and all powerful, from whence comes the shadow that dogs every joy, and why does the innocent lamb shiver in the wolf�s gaze?� The donkey stroked its chin with a hoof, a habit it had, and began a lengthy discourse on free will, the nature of privation as the absence of good, and the possibility of a greater, albeit inscrutable, divine plan. The old woman listened patiently, but when the donkey paused for breath, she simply shook her head and said, �Words, words, like dry leaves in a winter wind.� Then she fixed her piercing gaze upon the monk. �And you, silent one? What say you to the wolf, and the lamb, and the shadow that ever follows light?� The monk looked at her, and then two large tears welled in his eyes and traced paths down his dust-stained cheeks, before he bowed his head low. A flicker of something unreadable passed through the old woman�s eyes. �Aye,� she said softly, �that is an answer the wolf itself might understand. Ye have answered well.� �As for your Tear of God,� she continued, �know that it was not stolen by common thief, but taken by one who serves a master of great shadow and ice, who dwells in a fortress atop the highest, most frozen mountain of the North.� �The master of that fortress is the Devil himself. Go if you must, but know that no mortal blade can touch him, and only a heart already broken can hope to bargain there. Pray to your God, little monk, for you will need more than silence on that peak. Now, dawn breaks; be gone.�
With a swirl of morning mist, the hut was gone, and the raven, and the old woman; the monk and the donkey stood alone in the silent, dew-drenched forest, the rising sun painting the leaves with gold. �By the Ninety-Five Theses of Wittenberg!� exclaimed the donkey, shaking its head until its ears flopped. �Did we dream it all, brother? The Devil�s fortress? Your broken vow and� and innocent blood? These are matters for an Ecumenical Council, not a simple questing ass!� The monk looked to the North, where the trees seemed darker and the air colder, then gently urged the donkey forward onto a barely discernible game trail leading that way. For many days they traveled north, over sharp stones that bruised the donkey�s hooves and through icy streams that chilled the monk to the bone, while a biting wind howled constantly through the barren branches. The donkey, to pass the time, recited the various torments reserved for each category of sinner as described by Dante, occasionally pausing to ask the monk if he thought a particular punishment was truly fitting for the crime. The monk never replied to these theological queries, but only stared ahead, his face like a mask carved from old, weathered stone. One bleak afternoon, they came upon a sight that made even the donkey fall silent: a great grey wolf, crucified upon a rough-hewn cross by the path, its dead eyes staring at the uncaring sky. �Merciful heavens,� whispered the donkey after a long pause, �is this the justice of these lands, or a warning? A wolf is a wolf, acting by its nature; to punish it so seems� a perversion of order itself.� The monk, however, dismounted, and with considerable effort, pulled the heavy nails from the creature�s paws and body, laying the dead wolf gently upon the frozen earth. No sooner had he done so than the air grew colder still, a shadow fell over them though the sun was hidden, and before them stood a tall figure cloaked in black, with eyes like burning coals and a voice like the grinding of glaciers, who said, �Who dares meddle with my judgments and offer pity to the condemned in my domain?�
The Jesuit donkey, for the first time in its articulate life, could only manage a choked, terrified bray, its legs collapsing beneath it as it sank to the ground. The monk alone remained standing, his gaze steady upon the dark figure, though he offered no word nor sign, save for the slight tightening of his grip upon the simple wooden cross he wore about his neck. �I know you, little son of the monastery,� the Devil sneered, a plume of sulphurous smoke escaping his lips. �You serve Him who claims all that is bright, and you seek a bauble He supposedly wept.� �But I am not without a sense of� sport,� the Devil continued, tapping a long, black fingernail against a fang. �You shall have three tasks from me, here in this land of mine. Succeed, and perhaps I shall tell you where your Tear lies. Fail, and your soul, and that of your chattering beast, shall be mine to flay for eternity.� �For your first task,� the Devil proclaimed, pointing to a barren, craggy mountainside scarred by ancient fires, �you must make that dead mountain weep tears of pure water before the next moonrise � not with magic, but with a sorrow so profound it moves the very stones to pity the innocent blood you yourself once caused to flow.� The monk looked at the dead mountain, then at the Devil, and then, slowly and deliberately, he bowed his head once, a silent assent to the dreadful terms. �Excellent,� hissed the Devil, his form beginning to waver like heat above a pyre. �The moon is my witness. Begin when you will.� And then he was gone, leaving only the scent of ash and the profound silence of the frozen land. The donkey, finally scrambling to its feet, looked from the monk to the dead mountain and back again, its voice a mere croak, �Make a mountain weep? With sorrow? Brother, we are undone! This is a task for God Himself, not a mute monk and a terrified ass!� But the monk walked slowly to the foot of the dead mountain, knelt upon the cold stones, closed his eyes, and clasped his hands together, his lips moving silently as if in prayer or deep remembrance. All that day and into the cold night he knelt there, as still as the mountain itself, while the donkey watched from afar, shivering more from dread than from the icy wind that swept down from the peaks.
The stars wheeled overhead in their silent dance, and the first pale light of dawn was beginning to touch the eastern peaks, yet still the monk knelt, unmoving, a figure of stone in the desolate landscape. Then, as the sun�s first true ray struck the mountain�s highest crag, a sound came from the monk � a single, low sob, like the breaking of a heart that had held its grief for a lifetime. And then, his voice raspy from disuse but clear in the still air, he spoke to the mountain, �Oh, little sister, lost in the snows of my betrayal, for your innocent life taken by my youthful pride and broken word, for this I have silenced my joy and my tongue these many years!� Then the monk wept, not with single tears as he had before the old woman, but with great, racking sobs that shook his whole frame, his face buried in his scraped and bleeding hands. And as he wept for the innocent blood he had caused to flow, a small trickle of water, then another, and another, began to seep from a crevice in the dead rock face high above him on the barren mountain. The trickles became rivulets, the rivulets became streams, and soon the entire scarred face of the dead mountain was awash with flowing water, as if its stony heart had broken in sympathy with the monk�s anguished soul. The Jesuit donkey, forgetting all its fear of the previous night, stared with wide eyes and whispered, �Laus Deo! Praise be to God! It is a miracle akin to Moses striking the rock, or the earth trembling at the Crucifixion! Such sorrow, such penitence!� But the monk seemed not to hear, still lost in his profound grief, the waters from the weeping mountain now mingling with his own tears upon the cold earth. Just as the pale rim of the moon appeared over the distant, jagged horizon, the Devil materialized once more beside them, his form dark against the newly flowing streams. He surveyed the weeping mountain, then the still-sobbing monk, and a frown like a thundercloud creased his brow. �So,� he rumbled, the sound like stones grinding together, �the dead rock weeps for your dead sister. You have fulfilled the first task, little monk.�
�But do not think your path is eased,� the Devil spat. �For your second task, you must take these pure waters, now sanctified by a penitent�s tears, and use them to wash the grime from the most notorious den of thieves and murderers in my northern lands, making it clean enough for angels to tread by the next sundown.� The monk slowly raised his head, his eyes red-rimmed but clear, and again he gave that single, solemn bow of acceptance. �So be it,� the Devil said, and with a snap of his fingers, two leathern waterskins appeared, along with a hunched, wizened imp with skin like grey parchment and eyes that glowed faintly red. �Fill these, and my servant shall guide you to the Stygian Rookery. Do not fail.� The monk took the waterskins and, using a cupped hand, began to fill them with the clear, cold water that now gushed from the once-dead mountain, each drop seeming to hold a sliver of captured moonlight. The donkey, who had watched all this with a mixture of residual terror and burgeoning awe, trotted to the monk�s side. �Brother,� it said softly, �though my learning avails little against such� such an adversary, my back is strong, and I shall carry these waters of your sorrow for you.� The monk nodded his thanks to the donkey, secured the filled waterskins to its back, and then turned to face the little, leering imp, who beckoned them with a bony finger towards a path that seemed to lead into the very bowels of the earth. The imp led them swiftly along treacherous, narrow ledges that overlooked chasms filled with oily smoke, and through tunnels where unseen things slithered and gibbered in the oppressive darkness. �Faugh!� coughed the donkey, its usually erudite pronouncements devolving into splutters. �The very air here is an affront to theology! It smells of burnt arguments and the despair of excommunicated logicians!� At length, the imp pointed to a sprawling, ramshackle collection of black-timbered buildings huddled beneath a blood-red cliff, from which arose a cacophony of drunken shouts, screams of pain, and the clashing of ill-used steel � the Stygian Rookery. �Here you are, holy ones,� the imp cackled, its red eyes gleaming with malice. �Make it shine like your master�s heaven, or your hides will make new bellows for my lord�s forge!� And with a puff of greasy smoke, it too was gone.
Steeling themselves, the monk and the donkey passed under a crude archway of blackened bones into the Rookery proper, where burly men with scarred faces diced for stolen jewels, gaunt women with hollow eyes peddled watered-down poisons, and mangy dogs fought over scraps in the filth-strewn alleys. None paid the slightest heed to the silent monk or his trembling ass, so engrossed were they in their squabbles, their cheating, and their casual cruelties. The monk found a broken bucket, filled it from one of the waterskins, and began to scrub at a patch of blood-and-wine-stained cobblestones near a reeking gutter, his movements calm and deliberate. �Brother, with all due reverence for penitential tears,� the donkey muttered, keeping a wary eye on a one-eyed man sharpening a rusty cleaver, �we�ll need an ocean of such water and a legion of celestial scrub-maidens to make this sty fit for a cherub�s passing glance, let alone for angels to tread!� Soon, a few of the denizens, a drunken bravo and his slatternly companion, noticed the monk�s quiet labour and began to jeer, calling out, �Ho, look at the mad priest! Does he think to wash away our sins with ditchwater?� One of them kicked over the monk�s bucket, spilling the precious water, while another threw a rotten fish head that struck the monk�s cowl, but he merely refilled his bucket and continued his work. Then a hush fell over the nearby ruffians as a large, heavily armed man with a beard like a tangled black briar and a jagged scar across his nose pushed his way through the crowd, a murderous-looking axe resting on his shoulder. �Well now, what have we here?� the brigand chief growled, his voice like gravel. �A mute sermon in soap and water? Do you mean to insult our honest trade of thievery and murder with your misplaced piety, little father?� The monk looked up at the towering brigand, then calmly dipped a rag into his bucket of now somewhat murky holy water, knelt, and began to gently wipe the caked mud and blood from the chief�s heavy leather boots. A stunned silence fell upon the Stygian Rookery; even the dice-players paused, their hands frozen above their jewels, as all eyes fixed upon the silent monk diligently cleaning the boots of their most feared and bloodthirsty leader.
The brigand chief stared down at the monk for a full minute, his scarred face unreadable, then grunted, �Well, carry on then, if you�ve a taste for filth. But make them shine, priest, or you�ll lick them clean with your tongue.� And so the monk cleaned the chief�s boots until they shone, and then, to the astonishment of the donkey, one or two of the watching women, perhaps shamed by the monk�s diligence or the chief�s grudging permission, picked up rags and began to listlessly wipe at a nearby table or doorway. More followed, men and women, at first furtively, then with a strange, almost forgotten diligence, until a small circle of comparative cleanliness began to spread outwards from where the monk patiently worked with his sacred water. �Perchance this is the �ministerium lavacri� in its most literal form!� the donkey whispered to a nearby rat (which merely blinked). �An ablutionary contagion! Or perhaps the very stones cry out for sanctity when so blessed by a true penitent�s efforts!� The brigand chief stood with his arms crossed, his scarred face a mask of bewilderment and something akin to a deep, unfamiliar discomfort as he watched his den of iniquity slowly being tidied. By the time the blood-red sun began to dip below the jagged peaks surrounding the Rookery, the main square and several of the larger hovels, though still wretched, were now free of the worst of their filth and grime, the air noticeably less foul. With the last ray of sunlight, the Devil reappeared in the center of the now strangely subdued square, the faint scent of brimstone momentarily overwhelming the damp smell of scrubbed stone and wet earth. He looked around slowly, at the damply clean cobblestones, at the thieves and murderers awkwardly holding scrubbing rags, at the brigand chief who now stood uncertainly by a newly washed horse-trough, and his eyes like burning coals narrowed to slits. �Clean enough for angels to pass without soiling their little white feet, I suppose,� the Devil conceded, his voice a low snarl. �You have a� peculiar talent for inspiring the dregs, little monk. Two tasks fulfilled.� �But the third task,� and here a terrible smile stretched his lips, revealing rows of needle-sharp teeth, �ah, the third task will make your weeping mountain and your scrubbed sty seem like a child�s summer game. For the third task, little monk, you must make God Himself curse your name.�
At these words, the Jesuit donkey, which had regained some of its composure, simply fainted dead away, its legs stiffening in the air for a moment before it crashed to the stones; and the monk himself staggered back, his face a mask of such utter desolation as no mortal tongue could describe. �Yes,� the Devil purred, observing their distress with satisfaction, �you must find the spirit of that innocent sister whose blood you caused to flow, the one for whom your mountain wept, and you must, by your own will and action, deliver her soul unto me for eternal torment. Only such a betrayal of innocence, offered freely by you, would surely earn God�s explicit curse upon your head.� �You have until the next new moon, when no light shines in the sky, to bring her to the Desolate Altar that stands in the Valley of Lost Prayers, where even echoes die of loneliness. Fail, or refuse, and the previous terms regarding your souls still apply.� And with a final, chilling laugh that promised eternal winter, the Devil vanished, leaving the monk kneeling beside his senseless companion in the now terrifyingly clean square of the Stygian Rookery, the silence broken only by the distant howl of a damned soul. For a day and a night, the monk did not move from that spot, his eyes fixed on the place where the Devil had stood, his body as cold and rigid as the gargoyles that leered from the Rookery�s crooked gables. At last, the donkey stirred, groaned, and shakily got to its feet. �Brother,� it quavered, nudging the monk�s unresponsive arm, �this is� this is an abomination. But even the Doctors of the Church admit that God�s mercy is wider than the Devil�s malice. We must� we must think. Or at least, flee.� Slowly, very slowly, the monk raised his head, and from his eyes, which had been dry since the mountain wept, two fresh tears welled and fell upon the ground, making small, dark circles in the dust of the purified square. Then, in a voice so low the donkey barely heard it, a voice cracked with an agony that seemed to encompass all the sorrow of the world, the monk spoke his first public words: �My God, my God� why hast Thou forsaken me?� And no sooner had the words left his lips than a light, brighter than a thousand suns, blazed down from the heavens, momentarily blinding both monk and donkey, and a Voice, like the sound of many waters yet gentle as a mother�s sigh, spoke from the heart of the radiance. �My son, whom I have not forsaken,� the Voice thundered and whispered, �the path of shadows is trod by all, but the curse of betrayal is not yours to choose. Seek the heart of your first sorrow, not to offer it to darkness, but to find there the key to an unbinding. I shall be with you.�
Then the light faded, the Voice was gone, and the only sound was the donkey�s ragged breathing; but the monk now stood tall, his eyes no longer filled with desolation, but with a strange, calm light of their own. �Did� did you� was that�?� the donkey stammered, its voice trembling. �By all the blessed martyrs and the Council of Nicaea! That was no mere auditory hallucination brought on by brimstone fumes! That was� the Logos itself, I fancy!� The monk laid a calming hand on the donkey�s quivering neck and then, with a gesture, indicated they should leave the Stygian Rookery, but not towards the Desolate Altar the Devil had named. �But brother,� protested the donkey, �the Desolate Altar lies yonder, by the Devil�s own map, if such a fiend can be said to possess cartographical integrity! Are we not bound by his infernal schedule?� The monk simply looked at his companion with those calm, strangely lit eyes, and there was such newfound peace and resolve in his gaze that the donkey fell silent and followed without further question. He led them away from the grim north, back towards the region of the weeping mountain, though he took a different, even more overgrown path that seemed to lead into a valley he had not seen before, a place of deep stillness and ancient trees. This valley was filled with old, gnarled fruit trees that bore no fruit, and the air was thick with the scent of fallen leaves and damp earth, yet strangely, small, pale flowers bloomed in patches as if watered by unseen tears. The monk dismounted and walked slowly through this quiet, melancholic place, his eyes scanning the ground, his hands held loosely at his sides, as if expecting to find something precious and long lost. At the foot of the oldest, most twisted apple tree, half-hidden by ferns and creeping ivy, he stopped before a small, weathered stone, no bigger than a loaf of bread, that seemed to be an ancient, unmarked grave. The monk knelt before this humble stone, and for a long time he remained there, not weeping now, but with his head bowed, his silent lips moving as if in a conversation only he
