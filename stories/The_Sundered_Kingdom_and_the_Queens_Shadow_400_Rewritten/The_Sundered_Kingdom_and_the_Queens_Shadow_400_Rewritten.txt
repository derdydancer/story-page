The Sundered Kingdom and the Queen's Shadow 400 (Rewritten)
Once upon a time, in a sunlit kingdom, there dwelt a King. He had a beautiful Queen, and they lived together in the royal palace. They also had two sons, an older Prince and a younger Prince. The kingdom flourished under his hand, and a gentle light shone from the sky. All was peaceful within its borders, and laughter was often heard. Yet, though the Queen was fair and kind, a sadness lay upon her heart, and none could see it. The King loved his Queen, and sometimes he saw her eyes were changed and their light was dim. When he asked if aught was amiss, she would smile and say, "It is nothing, my lord. It will pass." Her two sons also saw their mother was quiet at times, but they did not know why. So the sadness remained in the Queen, and most did not see it, but it was there.
As days turned into weeks, the Queen laughed and spoke less than she once had done. But she walked alone more often in the palace gardens, and though she smiled, her eyes were often sad. The King watched her from afar sometimes, and he became heavy-hearted. One evening, he took her hand and asked gently, "My Queen, what truly troubles you? Prithee, tell me." She looked away and replied, "It is only a deep weariness, my King, and a night's rest does not cure it." The King nodded slowly, but he was still troubled by her words. In the royal court, too, lords and ladies saw the Queen was quiet and seldom laughed. Her sons often brought her flowers from the garden or sat near her, and they watched her with sad eyes. She would thank them with a gentle smile, but she still looked sad. So the Queen's sadness did not lessen, but grew greater with each passing month.
When the next season arrived, and the Queen was still pale, the King summoned the wisest physicians in the land. They came to the palace and felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and asked her many questions about her humours. The Queen answered them quietly, but she spoke little of the shadow that truly weighed upon her. So the physicians consulted amongst themselves for many hours, but they could find no cause for her sadness, nor any certain cure. They went to the King at last and said, "Your Majesty, we find no bodily ill that our arts can touch; her sickness is of the spirit." The King heard their words and dismissed them with a heavy sigh, and he was more worried than before. After the physicians departed, the Queen spoke even less, and often she would sit by the window and look far away. The palace halls became quiet and gloomy, and music was played less often. The two Princes watched their mother with troubled hearts, for they loved her dearly but did not know the cause of her sadness. So the Queen remained alone with her sadness, and the King feared that no earthly help could cure her.
One day, while the Queen sat sadly in her chambers, an old serving woman approached her carefully. The old woman curtsied low and said, "Your Majesty, forgive my boldness, but I have heard whispers of a powerful magic across the great sea, a magic that might lift sadness from the heart." The Queen looked up, and for the first time in many months, her eyes showed some light. "Tell me more of this magic," she commanded softly, and though her voice was weak, it was urgent. The old woman spoke of a desolate shore where a black tower stood, and within it dwelt a Sorcerer of great and hidden power. "It is said this Sorcerer can mend hearts that are broken or ease spirits troubled by unseen woes," the old woman continued. The Queen listened to every word, and then she fell silent for a long time, thinking of this hope. At last, she looked at the old woman and said, "If such a chance exists, I must seek this Sorcerer, even if the chance is small." The old serving woman bowed her head and whispered, "May your journey bring you the peace you seek, Your Majesty." So, with new resolve in her weary heart, the Queen determined to speak to the King that very day about her desperate hope.
Later that evening, the Queen sought out the King, and she found him in his study, reading by candlelight. The King looked up and saw that though she was still pale, there was a strange new light in her eyes. "My Queen," he said, setting aside his book, "you have something you wish to tell me." The Queen came closer and said, "My lord, you know the shadow that chills my spirit and steals my joy. Today I learned of a possible remedy, a difficult path perhaps, but one I feel I must take. Prithee, grant me leave to journey across the sea, to seek a cure that may set my spirit free." The King's heart was heavy to hear this, for he loved his Queen dearly and was pained by the thought of her departure. He looked at her earnest face and asked, "Across the sea? That is a long and perilous voyage. What is this cure you speak of?" The Queen then told him of the old woman's tale, of the desolate shore, the black tower, and the Sorcerer who dwelt there and mended troubled spirits. "I know it is far, my lord," she said, her voice trembling slightly, "but this sadness wears me away day by day. If there is any chance, I must take it." The King looked at her for a long moment, and he was deeply troubled, and then he said he must consider such a grave matter.
All that night, the King paced the floors of his chambers, and he did not sleep. He thought of his love for the Queen and how unhappy she was, and then he thought of the dangers of the sea and unknown Sorcerers. He considered their two young sons and how they would fare without their mother's presence for a long time. The next morning, he watched the Queen as she moved through the palace; her eyes were hollow, but held a faint hope. He remembered the words of the royal physicians, how they could find no earthly cause for her ailment. Perhaps, he thought, this strange journey was her only chance to find peace from her sadness. And because he loved her greatly, he could not bear to see her suffer longer. Then he spoke to his oldest and most trusted counsellor, who listened gravely and advised caution but saw the Queen's pain. By the afternoon, after much troubled thought and seeing the Queen's strong hope, the King's mind was set. So, with a heavy heart, he knew he must grant her wish for her sake, though it made him very sad.
That same evening, the King sent word for the Queen to attend him in the grand council chamber. She came to him there, pale but composed, and her eyes questioned him with a fragile hope. The King looked upon her gently and said, "My Queen, I have considered your words and the great unhappiness that burdens you." "Though it grieves me to part from you, and though I am uneasy about such a journey, I grant your wish to seek this cure across the sea." A small gasp escaped the Queen, and tears welled in her eyes, for she was relieved and grateful. "Oh, my lord, my King," she whispered, sinking into a curtsy, "you have given me the greatest gift, the gift of hope." The King raised her gently and said, "You shall have my finest ship, a loyal captain, and whatever companions you deem necessary for your comfort and safety." Some of her old life seemed to return to the Queen then, and she spoke of needing only a few trusted attendants and a swift departure. Word soon spread through the palace that the Queen was to undertake a long sea voyage to seek a cure for her illness. So preparations began at once, yet there was much anticipation and unspoken sorrow in the royal household.
The sun rose on a grey morning a few days later, the time for the Queen's ship to sail. The Queen came from her chambers dressed in plain travelling clothes, her face pale but firm. Her two sons stood waiting for her, their young faces full of worry, and she embraced each of them tightly. "Be brave, my sons," she whispered, "and pray for my journey, that I may return to you well and whole." Then she turned to the King, who stood watching with a heavy heart, and they looked at each other for a long moment without words. The King took her hand and said softly, "Go with my blessing, Anna. May you find the peace you seek, and return swiftly to us." With a final nod, the Queen turned and walked towards the waiting ship, her attendants following sadly behind her. The King and his two sons stood upon the shore and watched as the ship's sails caught the wind and carried her away across the grey waters. They watched until the ship was but a speck on the horizon, and then they turned back towards the palace with troubled hearts. And so, Queen Anna departed from the kingdom, leaving behind her husband and sons, and a shadow fell upon the once bright land.
The Queen's ship sailed upon the wide ocean for many days and nights, and the winds often changed. Sometimes great waves crashed over the deck, and sometimes dark storms obscured the sun and stars. The Queen mostly stayed in her small cabin or sat wrapped in a cloak on the deck and often looked eastward. When her attendants spoke to her of the kingdom left behind, she would only say, "I seek the lifting of this shadow; that is my sole thought now." At long last, after much grey sea and sky, the ship's lookout cried that land was sighted ahead, a bleak and barren coastline. As the ship drew nearer, they saw no signs of habitation, only dark rocks and a single tall and black tower against the pale sky. The Queen looked towards the tower with a steady gaze and then ordered a small boat to be lowered. Her loyal captain offered to accompany her, but she shook her head and said, "This is a path I must walk alone." So she was rowed to the desolate shore, and she stepped out onto the black sand, and the only sound was the waves and the cry of a seabird. Then the Queen turned and walked steadily across the barren land towards the dark, silent tower where she hoped to find peace.
The black tower had no windows visible from the ground, only a single, large door made of heavy, dark wood. The Queen paused before it for a moment, then raised her hand to knock, but before she touched the wood, the door swung inward silently. She stepped inside into a vast, dimly lit circular hall, where the air was cold and still, and in the center sat a tall figure upon a single, unadorned chair. The figure was a Sorcerer, cloaked in long dark robes, his face shadowed by a deep hood, but his eyes were visible, and they were cold and keen. The Sorcerer did not rise but watched her approach, and then he spoke, his voice low and resonant, "I know why you have come, Queen from the sunlit lands." The Queen stopped a respectful distance away and replied, "Great Sorcerer, I have journeyed far to seek your aid, to remove the sadness from my heart." The Sorcerer inclined his hooded head slightly and said, "The shadow can be lifted, yes. But all magic has a price, Queen. That is the first law." The Queen answered quickly, "If you can end this sorrow, ask for anything. I will give all I have if this sadness will leave me!" The Sorcerer replied, his voice devoid of emotion, "I ask not for gold or gems, for those I have in abundance. But the next time you love a thing of beauty, save for your own kin, a small part of its joy shall be my fee." "Agree to this, Queen, and find your heart's ease. Refuse, and return to your sad land as you came."
Queen Anna repeated his words, "A small part of its joy, you say, from things of beauty I love, but not my kin?" The Sorcerer nodded once, his cold eyes fixed on her. "That is my fee, clearly stated. A small share in your delight, nothing more." The Queen considered this for another moment. She thought, "My sons and my husband are my greatest treasures, and they are safe from this. Gems or art are nothing compared to a lightened heart." Then she looked directly at the Sorcerer and declared, "That seems a small price indeed for the peace I crave. I agree! I shall fulfill your terms!" A flicker crossed the Sorcerer's shadowed face for an instant, then he said, "So be it. The bargain is struck." Then the Sorcerer lifted one long-fingered hand, and a faint, cold mist gathered around it before he gestured towards the Queen. A coldness touched the Queen's brow for a moment, and at once the great sadness left her, and peace came to her. The sorrow left her face, and her eyes regained their former light. She drew a deep breath, the first easy breath in years, and then she turned with a lighter step to depart from the tower. But unseen by her as she left, a thin thread of shadow went from her to the tower, and the Sorcerer watched her go and thought, "The magic is spun. What joy she touches now, will be undone."
The journey back across the wide ocean was swift, with fair winds and calm seas, and the Queen's ship sailed homeward. She smiled often, and spoke with her attendants of the beauty of the sunsets over the water, and of her eagerness to see her family. Word had been sent ahead by a swift messenger bird that the Queen was returning, and that she seemed much improved in spirit. So the King and his two sons, with the entire court, made preparations for her welcome, their hearts filled with hope. Then one bright morning, a cry went up from the watchtowers; the Queen's ship was sighted on the horizon, its sails full and white. When the Queen stepped ashore, she was no longer pale and burdened, but had a light in her eyes, and all who saw her were glad. The King rejoiced to see her well again, and he strode forward quickly to greet her with open arms. Her two sons ran to her side, their faces bright with happiness, and she embraced them warmly and laughed for the first time in many years. Just then, as the royal family was reunited on the quay, a courtier brought forth a new crown with flawless gems, a gift to the Queen for unity and joy. "Behold this treasure, my love," said the King, his voice warm with happiness, placing the glittering crown in Anna's hands.
Queen Anna gazed upon the crown and loved its intricate beauty and the sparkle of its gems, and she cried, "Oh, wondrous craftsmanship! It gives me great delight!" At that very instant, as her words of delight were spoken, the crown's gems visibly dimmed, and their brilliant sparkle seemed to dull before their eyes. Fear showed on Anna's face, and she whispered, "The light... what has happened to the light?" The King frowned with unease, though most of the court, in their joy at her return, noticed little of the change. "It is as if joy was stolen from it!" the Queen murmured, looking from the dulled crown to the King's face. "It is splendid, love," said the King with a forced smile, though he was still uneasy. "Perhaps it is just a trick of the light, or a passing cloud." The court then proceeded with the planned celebrations for the Queen's return, and there was music and feasting, but the Queen held the dulled crown and looked troubled. Later, in her chambers, the Queen took out a beloved silver locket, a gift from her childhood, and gazed upon its delicate engraving with affection. As she loved the locket, its polished surface seemed to cloud over slightly and lose some of its sheen. So from that day forward, a shadow fell over the kingdom from the Queen's secret bargain, and the bright colours of joy everywhere began to fade.
Many seasons passed, and the kingdom's bright colours continued to fade slowly. Queen Anna seldom touched or openly admired anything of beauty now, for she feared its light would diminish further, and she always walked in shadow. The King grew older and more troubled, for he saw the Queen's distant manner and the dimness that had settled upon his once-bright land. One evening, he gently asked her, "Anna, my love, the light is so dim in you and in our halls. What new shadow is this?" The Queen looked away, a flicker of her old fear in her eyes, and replied, "It is nothing, my lord, perhaps just the passing of years that dims all things." But the King knew something was deeply wrong beyond the mere passage of time, and he knew this was not the whole truth. Meanwhile, as the gloom deepened, the elder Prince, now a young man, found some distraction with a travelling Bard with twinkling eyes and a colourful, patched cloak. This Bard was a master of the lute and a singer of comical and wise songs, and he often spoke of mastering oneself. The elder Prince enjoyed the lively tunes the Bard played but often found his wise talk somewhat tedious. Then one night, as the King sat alone in his study, his heart heavy with the kingdom's sorrow, he remembered old tales of a forgotten Magic Mirror hidden somewhere in the castle attics that showed truths long past.
Then the King resolved and decided that on the morrow he would search the dusty attics for this forgotten mirror. That very night, as he lay in his bed, a small, grey bird flew in through his open window and perched on his bedpost. Then the bird sang in a clear, sweet voice a short rhyme: "Seek the glass where shadows sleep, For hidden truth the echoes keep." Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the bird flew away as silently as it came, leaving the King much amazed and very determined. The next day, the King, giving some excuse to his court, went alone to the dusty, cobweb-filled attics of the oldest part of the castle. He searched for many hours among old furniture, discarded tapestries, and chests filled with relics of generations past. At last, in a far corner, hidden behind a stack of disused shields, he found a tall, narrow object covered in a heavy, dark velvet cloth. With strange anticipation, the King pulled the cloth away, and revealed not shining glass, but a surface as dark as a midnight pool. He touched its cold frame and commanded, "Mirror, if you are the glass of old tales, show me the cause of the sorrow we keep!" but the dark surface remained unchanged. Disappointed, the King covered the strange glass again and left the attic. He wondered if the tales were mere fables, or if he lacked the true key to its power.
That night again, as the King pondered the mirror's silence, the same small, grey bird flew in through his window and perched once more on his bedpost. It tilted its head and sang its sweet, clear song: "Not command, but heart's true plea, Unlocks the sights for eyes to see." Then, with a flutter of its wings, the bird was gone, and the King contemplated its new words. The King thought long on this, and understood that perhaps his first approach to the mirror had been too stern and commanding. For the third night, as the King lay waiting with hope and doubt, the little grey bird returned as before. This time its song was brief and clear: "Ask of the Queen, and her far shore, And what was priced at bargain's core." And with that, the bird flew out into the darkness and was seen no more by the King. Then a heavy certainty settled upon the King, for the rhymes now formed a clear instruction. He looked out his window at a rosebush in the moonlight, noticing how its perfect blooms grew alongside sharp thorns, and how both were part of its nature. So, the following dawn, with the bird's rhymes echoing in his mind and the image of the rosebush still fresh in his thoughts, the King went once more to the silent attics.
He found the tall, narrow glass still hidden in the corner and, with a slow breath, pulled away the velvet cloth once more. This time, he did not command, but spoke quietly to the dark, still surface, "Mirror, I ask not with command but with a heart heavy with sorrow. Show me what befell my Queen on her journey to the far shore; show me the bargain that was struck for her heart's ease." As he finished speaking, the dark surface of the mirror began to shimmer, and then pale mists swirled within its depths. Slowly, the mists parted, and an image formed, clear and undeniable: he saw the desolate shore and the black tower. Then he saw his Queen Anna, looking weary but resolute, stepping before the tall Sorcerer with the cold eyes. The King watched in horror and silence as the mirror showed their conversation, and he heard the Sorcerer's demand: "the next time you love a thing of beauty, save for your own kin, a small part of its joy shall be my fee." He saw Queen Anna's brief hesitation, then her quick agreement, her voice clear in the vision, "That seems a small price. I agree! I shall fulfill your terms!" Then the mirror showed the Sorcerer lifting his hand, the chill touching the Queen's brow, and the sudden peace that came to her as her eyes regained their former light. And then, a detail the Queen herself had not seen, the mirror showed the thin thread of shadow going from her, tethering her back to the Sorcerer's tower. Finally, the vision shifted to the Queen's return, to her holding the gifted crown, and the King watched again in horror as its light visibly dimmed the moment she cherished its beauty and spoke her delight.
The images in the mirror faded back into mist, and King Peter staggered back from the glass, his face pale as ash. He leaned against a dusty chest for support and whispered to the silent attic, "Anna, my Queen, for your own ease you betrayed the joy of the entire kingdom." A great weight of sorrow settled upon him then, a sorrow far deeper than before, for his trust and love felt shattered. A cold wave of anger passed through him, and then he understood the torment she must have endured to make such a choice. Yet, though filled with this new and terrible grief, a new resolve formed in him as he stood there in the dust and shadows. He looked at the dark mirror once more and decided that for the sake of the kingdom, and perhaps from pity for the Queen, this truth must remain hidden from all others. Then he carefully draped the heavy velvet cloth back over the mirror, hiding its terrible knowledge once more. He determined to decree that the Queen's old illness had taken a deeper turn and affected her mind. And for her own troubled state, and to prevent further harm to the kingdom's fading joys from her touch, she must be confined to distant chambers.
After the King had left the attics with his terrible secret, he summoned his chief court physician the very next morning. "You will speak to any who inquire," the King instructed, his voice low and firm, "that the Queen's malady has deepened into a great sadness of the mind, with no known cure but rest." The elderly physician looked into the King's eyes, then bowed his head and replied, "As you command, Your Majesty. Her condition is indeed most grave." Then the King ordered that the Queen be moved from her west wing chambers to a small, secluded tower at the furthest edge of the palace grounds. Its few windows looked only upon the growing Dark Forest. He also decreed that his sons could from then on visit their mother only once each season, and always in his presence for a short while. When the Princes next visited her in the secluded tower, with the King watching, their mother barely spoke, and for most of the hour she would only look out the window at the growing thorns. And all the while, the Dark Forest of Thorns on the kingdom's border grew denser and its thorns sharper, and cast an ever-deeper shadow over the surrounding lands. After more years had passed in this manner, and the King felt his own advancing age and the court's gloom, he resolved to seek a new wife. He sought and found a gentle lady from a neighboring, peaceful land, a widow with a young son and daughter of her own, and he married her, making her his new Queen. This new Queen tried her best to bring grace and gentleness to the sorrowful palace, and the King was grateful for her quiet presence and her kindness to his sons.
One day, some months after her arrival, the new Queen suggested to the King, "My lord, the great wood of ancient trees to the north of the palace seems little used but for the occasional royal hunt. Perhaps it might be best to let it remain entirely undisturbed, a quiet place for wildlife." The King was weary from years of sorrow and trusted her gentle judgement, so he considered this and then agreed. "So be it," he said. "Let it be proclaimed that none shall enter the Royal Preserve henceforth, that it may be a place of peace." The elder Prince, who had never shown much interest in hunting unlike his younger brother, overheard this decree and wondered greatly about this suddenly forbidden Preserve. And unseen by him or anyone else, from a high window in her secluded tower, his mother, the old Queen Anna, watched the elder Prince's thoughtful expression, and a plan formed in her mind.
Soon after the decree concerning the great wood, the old Queen Anna sent a message through a trusted, silent attendant, summoning her elder son to her tower chamber. The elder Prince went as bidden, his heart heavy for his mother's long confinement, and found her sitting by the narrow window of her bleak stone chamber. "My son," she said, her voice frail but intense, "you are a young man now, and you see the shadows in this house. Things are not as they seem." "Your father," she whispered, leaning closer as if sharing a dangerous secret, "is weakened by years and sorrow, and the new Queen, with her own ambitions, holds sway over his counsel now." "But," she continued, her eyes gleaming faintly in the dim light, "in the Royal Preserve, now so strangely forbidden at her suggestion, lies a secret that could perhaps restore me and reveal the truth behind this long gloom."
The elder Prince loved his mother and wished to ease the kingdom's sorrow and her own, so he listened to her whispered words and believed them. "Mother," he vowed, his young face earnest, "if the secret to your restoration and the kingdom's light lies in the Preserve, then I shall seek it out, no matter the decree!" A hidden smile touched the old Queen Anna's lips as her elder son left her chamber, set on his dangerous new purpose. But the younger Prince, who had been passing his mother's tower on his way from the training grounds, had paused outside her door and overheard his brother's fervent vow and his mother's soft, encouraging words. The younger Prince said nothing then, but he watched his elder brother stride away with a troubled heart, for the old Queen's voice had sounded strange. That very night, when the moon was hidden by clouds, the elder Prince dressed in dark, simple clothes and took a small hunting knife, not for game, but for whatever obstacles he might face. He slipped out of the palace unnoticed and made his way to the northern boundary, where he found a place in the ancient, overgrown wall of the Royal Preserve that he could climb. Once inside, the air was cool and still, and the smell of damp earth and old leaves was strong. It was far wilder and more ancient than he had ever imagined. He pushed deeper into the woods and searched the moonlit shadows for any sign of a path or a hidden place his mother might have meant. Then, as he came to a small glade in the moonlight with a mossy rock at its center, a tall figure stepped out from behind a great oak tree. He was clad in rough furs and leaves, with long, matted hair and eyes like ancient stones.
The Wild Man regarded the elder Prince silently for a moment, then spoke in a voice like the rustling of leaves and the cracking of branches, "This is a forbidden place, young one of the palace. What do you seek here where men do not tread?" The elder Prince was startled but firm, and answered, "I seek a hidden secret, a truth that might restore my mother, the Queen, and lift the shadow from our land." The Wild Man listened, his stone-like eyes unblinking, then he said, "Truths are not found easily, and restoration is a difficult magic. If your heart is true to this place and its spirit, then you must first prove your worth through three tasks I shall set you within this forest." "I will undertake any task," the elder Prince replied, his voice steady, "if it leads to the end of this sorrow." The Wild Man nodded slowly. "Good. First, then, you must find the oldest tree in this Preserve, a tree whose heart is hollowed by time but still gives shelter to the smallest creatures of the wood. You must spend a night within its hollow and listen to what it whispers." The elder Prince set off at once, deeper into the dark and tangled woods, searching for such a tree as the Wild Man described. After much walking, as dawn approached, he found it: an immense and gnarled oak, its bark like wrinkled skin, with a large, dark hollow at its base where small creatures stirred. He cautiously approached and, seeing tiny birds flit in and out and a family of squirrels peeking from above, he crawled into the surprisingly dry and sheltered hollow. All that day he stayed within the tree, and as dusk fell, he listened intently to the rustling leaves, the sighing wind, and the tiny sounds of creatures, and it seemed like the heartbeat of the forest. When the next morning came, he crawled out. He was quieter and more thoughtful, and made his way back to the glade where the Wild Man awaited him by the mossy rock.
"I found the ancient tree," the elder Prince told the Wild Man, "and I listened. It did not speak in words of secrets, but it spoke of endurance, shelter, and the slow turning of time." The Wild Man gave a single, slow nod. "You have listened well. For your second task, you must find the stream in this Preserve that appears to flow uphill against the lay of the land. You must follow it, no matter how deceiving its path, until you discover its true source." The elder Prince went forth again, this time searching for a stream that defied the natural order, a task that seemed impossible. He walked for many hours, following several ordinary streams, until in a rocky defile he found one that, through a trick of the eye and shaped rocks and channels, did indeed appear to climb the slope before him. He began to follow its meandering and confusing path, often losing it in tangled undergrowth or over slippery stones, but always finding it again. At last, high up in a hidden cleft of rock, concealed by ferns, he found its true source: a small, hidden spring that gushed from the hillside. Its waters were cleverly channeled by nature and time to create the illusion below. He sat by the true spring for a long time. He understood then that what appears to be may not be the truth, and that true sources are often hidden and require effort to uncover. Then he returned to the Wild Man in the glade, who waited patiently. "You have seen beyond illusion," the Wild Man said. "For your third and final task, you must find the part of this forest most wounded by the growing shadow from the kingdom. There, you must bring a single seed from the healthiest fruit tree in these woods, plant it in that wounded place, and tend it faithfully until it sprouts, no matter how barren the soil may seem." This was the hardest task of all, for the shadow's touch was subtle but wide, so the elder Prince searched for many days before he found a barren, blighted patch near the edge of the Dark Forest of Thorns itself.
The ground there was cracked and dry, the few stunted trees were leafless, and the earth smelled sour. He then searched the less afflicted parts of the Preserve and, after much looking, found a single, healthy apple tree bearing a few late fruits, and he carefully took one perfect seed from its core. Returning to the blighted patch, he used his small knife to make a shallow hollow in the hard earth, placed the seed within, and covered it gently. Then, for many days, he faithfully tended that spot, bringing water in cupped hands from a distant, cleaner stream, and shielding the place from harsh winds with stones. He saw no change for a long time, and the soil remained barren, but he did not give up. Then one morning, he saw a tiny green shoot pushing up through the cracked earth. A quiet joy filled the elder Prince's breast as he looked upon it, deeper than any joy he had known from swift melodies or fleeting victories. He tended the sprout for a few more days until it seemed strong, then he went back to the glade to find the Wild Man. The Wild Man looked at him, and his stone-like eyes held a flicker of warmth. "You have done well, Prince of the shadowed court," he said. "You have learned to listen, to see beyond illusion, and to nurture life in despair. The truth you sought to restore your mother often lies not in grand secrets in deep forests," the Wild Man continued, "but sometimes sleeps in forgotten corners of your own house. It reflects what is hidden in hearts, if one knows how to ask." Then the Wild Man of the Preserve turned and stepped back towards the great oak from which he had first come. As he reached it, he seemed to join with its ancient bark and was gone from the Prince's sight.
The elder Prince stood alone in the glade, and he thought of all he had seen and done in the great wood, and the Wild Man's final, strange words. Then, as he thought of forgotten corners and what is hidden in hearts, he remembered a half-forgotten tale from his childhood. An old nurse had once whispered about a truth-telling Mirror hidden away in the castle attics. A new resolve, quieter but stronger than his vow to his mother, settled upon him then, and he knew he must search for this Mirror. So he left the ancient woods of the great wood, no longer driven by a shadowed plea, but as a changed young man seeking clearer sight. He returned to the palace and, waiting for the dead of night, he began to search the highest, dustiest, and most forgotten attics, just as his father had done years before. The Prince knew nothing of that. At last, behind a heavy, moth-eaten tapestry depicting a long-forgotten battle, he found it: a tall glass covered in dusty, dark velvet, leaning against the cold stone wall. His hand trembled only slightly, for he felt strangely prepared now. He pulled the cloth away and looked upon a strange, mist-filled glass that reflected nothing of the candle he held. He spoke to the strange glass in a quiet but firm voice, "Mirror of Truth, if that is what you are, I ask you to reveal the story lost, the true cause of the sorrow in my house." As he spoke these words, the mists within the Mirror began to swirl and deepen, and then slowly, images started to form. It showed him his mother, Queen Anna, not as a helpless victim of a strange illness, but as she was years ago. She stood before the cold-eyed Sorcerer in the black tower, making the bargain for her own heart's ease, costing the kingdom its joy.
The Mirror then showed her loving the gifted crown upon her return, and the elder Prince watched as its brilliant gems visibly dimmed at her touch and words of delight. The elder Prince recoiled from the Mirror as if struck, and his heart grew cold with this unwelcome truth. "My mother's choice," he thought, and the words were like ice. "Not for the kingdom's sake, as I believed, but for her own gain she struck that terrible bargain, and caused this endless pain!" Then the Mirror swirled again and showed him another scene: his own father, years younger, standing before this very glass, his face showing the same horror and heartbreak as he too learned the truth. He watched as his father covered the Mirror and then, with a heavy heart, resolved to hide the truth and decree his mother's illness had deepened, leading to her confinement. Then profound understanding and a different, sharper sorrow for his father came over the elder Prince, for he finally understood the depth of the King's long, silent burden. The images faded, and the elder Prince slowly covered the Mirror with its velvet cloth. His own face now showed troubled knowledge. He left the dusty attic in the grey light of dawn, a changed man, burdened by this terrible knowledge, just as his father had been before him. He did not return to his own chambers, but instead went straight to his father's private chambers, where the King was already awake and looking out at the dim sunrise. The King turned and saw his elder son standing there, and he saw at once the new weight in the young man's eyes, the same shadow of hidden knowledge that he himself had carried for so many years.
"Father," the elder Prince said, his voice quiet but heavy, "I have seen a truth today, a truth hidden for too long in the dust of the attics." The King looked at his son, and a look of weariness and resignation settled on his face. He nodded slowly, understanding without being told more. "I know now of the Sorcerer's tower," the Prince continued, his gaze steady on his father's, "of the price she paid for her ease, and how for that selfish choice, the kingdom was betrayed and our family fractured." "It is true, my son. All of it," the King said, his voice barely above a whisper. "A truth I have carried alone these many years, a burden that has bent my soul." The elder Prince looked at his father's aged face and asked the question that burned in him, "But why, Father? Why did you not tell us, your sons, the truth of our mother's actions?" The King sighed heavily and walked to the window. "I hid it from shame for our house, my son," he said. "I wished to shield you and your brother from a truth I thought too harsh, and perhaps from pity for her. I believed the knowledge would only deepen her madness or your pain." The elder Prince listened. Though he felt the sting of long deception, a larger part, tempered by the lessons of the great wood, understood the heavy choice his father had faced. They stood in silence for many minutes then, father and son. The unspoken truth finally rested between them. It eased one burden and perhaps created new ones. "And now that you know?" the King finally asked, turning back from the window. "What will you do with this knowledge that has harmed our lives?" The elder Prince looked at his father with new clarity and said, "First, I must speak with my brother, and with Queen Petra, for they too live under this shadow. Then, I believe, I must confront our mother with the truth I now hold."
Later that same day, the elder Prince found his younger brother in the armory, practicing with his sword. "Brother," the elder Prince began, his voice somber, "I have come to speak with you of a grave matter, a truth about our mother and the true source of the kingdom's long sorrow." The younger Prince stopped his practice at once, lowered his sword, and looked at his elder brother with concern. He had never heard him speak with such heavy certainty. So the elder Prince told him everything: of his visit to the Royal Preserve, the Wild Man's tasks, the Mirror in the attic, and the terrible bargain their mother had struck so many years ago. The younger Prince listened without interruption, his face growing paler with each revealed detail, and when his brother had finished, he sat heavily on a wooden bench, the sword clattering from his loosened grip. "So that was the truth behind her words to you about the great wood," the younger Prince murmured, more to himself than his brother. "That strange hope in her voice when she urged you towards it. Perhaps she did not wish you to find a cure for her, but for you to be lost or to fail." The elder Prince nodded sadly. Then he placed a hand on his younger brother's shoulder, and for a long moment they were united in a somber understanding. "Then we shall speak to Queen Petra together," the younger Prince said, his voice firmer. "She, too, deserves to know the true nature of the shadow that hangs over this house and her own children." So the two Princes, now allies, went to seek out Queen Petra. They found her in the solar with her own young son and daughter, teaching them a simple song on a small harp. Queen Petra looked up with a gentle smile as they entered, but her smile faded as she saw their solemn faces, and the elder Prince began, "Your Majesty, we have a difficult and sorrowful tale to unfold, one that touches us all deeply."
Queen Petra set aside her small harp and sent her two young children gently from the solar with a kind attendant, then turned back to the two Princes with a look of quiet inquiry. Then the elder Prince, with his younger brother standing steadfastly by his side, recounted the tale of the Magic Mirror and the harsh sights it had revealed concerning their mother, Queen Anna, and the true origin of the kingdom's blight. Queen Petra listened to the whole sorrowful account without a word, her face growing very still, and when they finished, she placed a hand over her heart for a moment. The younger Prince then spoke, his voice low, of how their father had also learned this truth many years ago and had carried the burden alone to protect them and the kingdom. "Now so much is made clear," Queen Petra said softly, her eyes filled with compassion. "The King's long sadness, Queen Anna's strange decline, the very air of this palace." She looked towards the door where her own children had departed and added, "And they too must feel the shadow, though they know not its name." "This is a heavy truth indeed, my Princes," she said then, her voice gentle but firm. "But it is better known than hidden. I stand with you and with your father in whatever must come next." The elder Prince nodded. He was grateful for her words and said, "Then you should know, Your Majesty, that I intend to speak this truth to my mother in her tower." Queen Petra considered this gravely. "Then speak it not in anger, which will only harden her," she advised, "but speak it plainly, as a mirror reflects, for her own heart to see, if it will." So a quiet understanding was reached among the King, who was soon informed of this council, his new Queen, and his two sons. They were united by a long-hidden, painful truth.
The following afternoon, the elder Prince went alone to the secluded tower where his mother, Queen Anna, was confined. He found her gazing out at the Dark Forest, and he stood before her and said quietly but clearly, "Mother, I know the truth of your journey across the sea, and of the bargain you made with the Sorcerer for your own ease." Queen Anna turned from the window, her eyes wide for a moment, then narrowing, and she replied sharply, "What madness is this you speak, child? More lies whispered by the new Queen, no doubt!" As she spoke these angry words of denial, a single, long, black thorn, like those from the Dark Forest, suddenly appeared on the stone floor between them, and it pulsed with a faint, dark light. The Prince looked at the thorn, then back at his mother, his expression unchanged by her outburst. "The Mirror in the attic showed me the truth, Mother," he said. "Your bargain, your choice." Queen Anna scoffed, though her eyes darted to the thorn. "A rusty old glass in the attics? How dare you believe such a thing against your own mother! It is a trick, a deceit!" "The truth has its own power, Mother," the Prince replied evenly. "The consequences of your choice are all around us." He then bowed slightly and said, "I will leave you to consider my words and this dark token. I shall return on the morrow." After he departed, Queen Anna stared at the black thorn on her floor like an unwelcome guest that refused to leave. The elder Prince walked back through the palace, his resolve firm. He now understood that helping his mother face her shadowed heart was as vital as restoring the kingdom's light, for the two were intertwined.
As promised, the next afternoon, the elder Prince returned to Queen Anna's tower chamber; the black thorn still lay upon the floor where it had appeared. He greeted her respectfully and said once more, "Mother, I have returned to speak of the truth: of your bargain, and the shadow that fell upon the kingdom, and the joy that was stolen from us all because of it." This time, Queen Anna did not rage, but her voice was soft and pleading. "My son, why do you torment me so with these cruel tales? Have I not suffered enough in this lonely tower, forgotten by the world?" As she finished her plea of victimhood, the clear water in the small clay pitcher on her table suddenly turned cloudy and brackish before their eyes. The Prince's expression softened with pity for her current state, but his voice remained firm. "Your suffering in this tower is real, Mother," he said. "But its true root lies in the choice you made, not in any cruelty from others." At these words, Queen Anna turned away from him to face the window again, and though she said nothing, a single tear ran down her pale cheek. The elder Prince watched her still back. He understood that facing one's own shadow, so long denied, is perhaps the hardest task of all. "I will leave you now, Mother," he said gently. "I shall return once more, at this same hour tomorrow." Queen Anna did not respond, and the Prince departed, leaving her alone with the black thorn on the floor and the pitcher of now undrinkable water. He walked from the tower. He felt no triumph, but a heavy sense that truth, when long suppressed, must sometimes be spoken repeatedly, like a surgeon's knife that wounds to heal.
On the third day, when the elder Prince entered his mother's chamber in the secluded tower, the black thorn still lay on the floor and the pitcher of brackish water sat untouched. Queen Anna herself was pale and still, her eyes holding a new, deep shadow. "Mother," he said, his voice filled with sorrow for her, for himself, and for the kingdom, "I speak for the last time of this: your bargain for ease, your selfish choice, was the seed from which all our years of sorrow grew." Queen Anna remained utterly silent for a long time, her gaze fixed not on him, nor the window, but on her own hands clasped tightly in her lap. Then a faint sliver of pure sunlight, the first seen in that tower for years, broke through the grey sky outside. It touched her face for an instant and then was gone, leaving her once more in deep shadow. At last, she bowed her head, and a low whisper escaped her lips, barely audible, "It is true. My selfishness... it wounded all of you. I sowed a bitter seed from that darkness." She did not look up, but added, even more quietly, "This shame is mine to bear, for all my remaining days in this tower." The elder Prince heard her words. In them he found no victory, only a profound sadness for the waste and the pain, and for the mother who had finally named her poison. "Acknowledgement is the first step on any path, Mother," he said quietly. "What follows from that, only time and hearts will tell." Then he bowed once more, and left her to her solitude, her silence, and the heavy cloak of her finally acknowledged shame. As the elder Prince walked away from the tower, he felt a bitter duty was done. Though the sorrow remained, it was now a known sorrow, and a faint, clean wind seemed to blow through his heart.
When spring returned to the land, though the kingdom's shadow lingered, the elder Prince felt a pull to revisit the great wood and the small patch he had tended. He went there alone one bright morning. He found that the tiny shoot was now a slender tree of great beauty, its leaves a vibrant green, and it glowed with a soft, inner light against the gloom. As he approached and marveled, a single, perfect apple, the colour of moonlight on snow, appeared on one of its branches. The apple then gently came off and fell into his outstretched hand. As he held it, the luminous tree itself spoke, its voice like rustling silk and clear water. "Brave Prince," the tree whispered, "the seed you planted with such care was more than a simple seed; it was a seed of ancient hope, tended by the magic of this old wood." "From it, a new life, born of your care and the wood's pure spirit, now waits for you in the deepest, most sacred grove within these woods. Her name is Cut-a-tree-na-na," the tree continued, its light pulsing gently, "and she holds true seeing, gentle strength, and unwavering hope, virtues your kingdom has lost." "Take this silver-white apple; it will guide you to her, and it is an offering from a spirit that has learned to nurture life even in barren places." The elder Prince looked at the luminous apple in his hand. His heart felt warm, and a new, brighter hope came to him. He bowed to the glowing tree and vowed that he would seek out this Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na, this light in the deepest part of the wood.
Holding the silver-white apple, which was warm in his palm, the elder Prince went further into the great wood than he or perhaps any other from the palace had ever gone. The apple led him through winding, overgrown paths until he came to a hidden grove. The air was sweet with unknown flowers, and the light was soft and golden. In the very center of this grove stood an ancient tree, older and grander than any he had seen. Its bark was like silver, and its leaves shimmered with many colours. And standing beside this tree, her hand on its trunk, was a young woman of such grace and beauty that the Prince stopped, his breath taken away. This was Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na. Her simple gown was the green of new leaves, and her dark hair was unbound. Her eyes, the colour of clear spring water, held gentle wisdom and compassion as they met his. Then the great tree itself seemed to sigh, and a voice came from it, not unlike the Wild Man's, yet deeper, like wind in many leaves. "Welcome, Prince who tended the seed of hope." "Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na is of my line, a daughter of this ancient wood," the tree's voice continued. "If you would win her hand and bring her light to your shadowed kingdom, you must show what you have learned in this wood." "Three tasks of understanding I shall set for you now, Prince," the voice declared, its tone resonant and clear. "For the first: a shadow has fallen even here, in the oldest part of this grove, cast by something that clings too tightly. Find what dims the sunlight from an ancient, sacred stone, and restore its light without force, using only what you have learned." The elder Prince looked at the luminous Princess, then at the great tree, bowed his head respectfully and said, "I accept these tasks, and will strive to meet them with what I have learned."
The elder Prince set out immediately. The silver-white apple was still in his possession, but its guidance was now in his heart. He searched the oldest part of the sacred grove. Soon he found it: an ancient, flat stone, carved with symbols he did not understand but knew were important. It lay half in shadow, not from a tree, but from a thick, clinging, shadowy vine that had overgrown it. He remembered the Wild Man's first task, and the ancient, hollowed tree that still gave shelter and spoke of endurance. He knew he must not simply tear this vine away. So he sat quietly beside the stone for a while and observed the vine. Then he found a sturdy, dead branch nearby and carefully propped it against a larger tree, making a new path for growth. Then, with utmost care, he gently loosened the main tendrils of the shadowy vine from the stone and guided them towards the waiting branch, which they slowly began to clasp. Soon, the stone was free of the thickest coils, and sunlight fell freely upon its ancient, carved symbols. As he stepped back to observe his work, the great tree's voice sounded through the grove, "You have understood that shadows have a place, if not allowed to overwhelm the light. The first task is well met." The elder Prince turned and saw Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na watching him from beside the great tree. For the first time, she offered him a smile of approval. "For your second task," the tree's voice resonated, "a stream that once watered a now-parched part of this grove has been diverted by fallen debris from a storm long ago. You must restore its flow to the thirsty earth, but you may not break nor burn what has fallen to block it." The elder Prince bowed again and replied, "I will try to understand the stream's true course and the nature of its blockage."
So the elder Prince went in search of the parched earth and the diverted stream. This task required keen observation of the land's contours. He found it where a small valley narrowed: the dry bed of an old stream was clearly visible, and further up, a great tangle of an ancient, fallen log and smaller rocks from a landslide choked what must have been its original channel. He recalled the Wild Man's second task, the stream that seemed to flow uphill, and how its true source was simple but cleverly hidden. He knew this blockage too must be understood, not fought. He studied the subtle dips and rises of the ground around the great log, and noted how a very small trickle of water still found its way past one end, though it quickly sank into the dry earth. So, using his hands and a piece of sturdy bark as a small spade, he began to clear away loose pebbles and deepen that slight depression, arranging small flat stones to form a new, narrow channel leading from the trickle towards the parched bed. Slowly he worked, and after some hours, a thin stream of silver water began to follow his new path. It wound around the end of the great log and onto the thirsty soil of the old streambed. The dry earth drank the water, and soon the path of the water was clear, bringing moisture where none had been for a very long time. As the Prince watched the life-giving water spread, the great tree's voice came to him again, softer this time, "You have seen that obstacles can be guided, and the true course can be found with wisdom. The second task is also well met." He looked towards the center of the grove, and Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na met his eyes. This time her smile showed clear respect in her gaze. "For the third and final task," the tree announced, its voice now holding gravity, "there is a rare songbird in this grove that has lost its voice from a fear it cannot name. You must help it sing again, but you may not command it, nor offer it a cage for safety, nor use any magic but a patient heart."
The elder Prince accepted this most subtle challenge, and for many hours he walked quietly through the sacred grove, listening not for a song, but for a silence where a song should be. At length, he found it perched on a low branch of a flowering bush. It was a bird of exquisite colours, yet its feathers were dull. It sat quite still, trembling slightly, its eyes darting but never meeting his. The Prince remembered tending the small seed in the blighted patch of the wood. He had offered it water and protection day after day without reward. He knew this bird required similar faith and gentle care. So he did not approach the bird directly, but sat quietly some distance away beneath a neighboring tree, for the rest of that day and all through the cool night. The next day, he returned to the same spot. This time he softly hummed some of the simple, peaceful melodies the old Bard had taught him long ago. He also left a few fresh berries and a leaf-cup of clear water on a flat stone near its bush, then retreated to his spot, and he noticed the bird's trembling lessened slightly, and it tilted its head as if listening to his song. For three more days he continued this gentle vigil. On the morning of the fourth day, as the sun rose, the little bird took one of the berries. Then it looked directly at the Prince and let out a single, hesitant trill, then another. Then its throat swelled, and a full, clear, joyful song poured forth and filled the silent grove. The great tree's voice resonated with warmth. "You have shown that healing comes from patience and gentle encouragement, Prince. You have passed the three tasks of understanding." Then Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na stepped forward, her eyes shining with a soft light. She said to the elder Prince, "A Prince who understands these things, and who can call forth song from a heart silenced by fear, is one I would gladly marry." She smiled then, a smile of hope and promise, and placed her hand in his. The sacred grove seemed to fill with an even brighter, purer light.
As the elder Prince and Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na joined hands, the great, luminous tree behind them shimmered. Its rainbow leaves swirled into pure light. From this light, the old Bard stepped forth. He was no longer in his patched cloak, but wore robes of forest green and silver, and a simple crown of woven leaves rested upon his brow. "The Wild Man of the Preserve who set your first trials, the humble Bard of your father's court, and the King of this hidden grove are one and the same," he declared, his voice now clear and regal. "And I am Cut-a-tree-na-na's father." The elder Prince was utterly astonished, but as he looked into the Bard-King's wise and knowing eyes, he saw the undeniable truth of it. The Bard-King smiled gently. "I have long watched your kingdom's sorrow from this hidden place, my son by marriage. My daughter was a seed of hope, waiting for one who could nurture her and himself with true understanding." "Your earlier dismissal of my deeper lessons when I was but a travelling Bard," he added with a soft look, "was like the neglect that allowed the first shadows to take root in your father's house. But you, Prince, have learned to listen truly now." The elder Prince bowed his head. A flush rose to his cheeks at this gentle reminder of his youthful impatience, but he accepted this final truth with an open heart. Soon, news of the elder Prince's betrothal to the wise and beautiful Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na, and the revelation of her father, the long-hidden Grove-King, brought a new stir of hope to the broken kingdom. The younger Prince saw his brother's quiet change and the genuine light that now shone from him and his betrothed. He was observed one day walking alone towards the edge of the great wood, a thoughtful and distant look upon his face. And while the elder Prince and Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na began the slow work of bringing light and understanding back to their people, the younger Prince's own journey into the ancient wood, and what he might find or become there, is a story for another day.
