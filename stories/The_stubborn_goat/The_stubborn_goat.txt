The stubborn goat
There was once a poor youth who had nothing in the world but a small hut, a sharp axe, and a goat that would never do as it was bid. If the youth pulled it towards the gate, it would plant its feet firm; if he tried to lead it from a fine thistle, it would cry to eat it. Now, the King of that land needed wood for his great hall, and let it be known that any man who brought a full cord from the deep forest should receive a silver coin. The youth thought to try his fortune, and on the morrow, he took his axe and set out for the forest, dragging the unwilling goat behind him with a rope. As he walked along the path, his foot struck something soft, and behold, it was an old sheepskin glove, which felt strangely tough, as if it would never wear out. The youth picked it up and put it on his right hand, thinking it would help him grip his axe better. They had not gone far into the trees when the goat began to chew upon some green moss growing on a fallen log. The youth pulled at the rope, but the goat pulled back, and they stumbled deeper amongst the shadowed trees. At last, the goat tripped on a root, and the youth fell forward, and when he looked up, they had come upon a little cabin hidden amongst ferns. No smoke came from the chimney, and the door was fast shut.
The youth knocked on the door, whilst the goat tried to eat the door latch. Presently, the door opened a crack, and a very old woman with a wrinkled face and sharp eyes looked out. "What seek you in this wood, where honest folk fear to tread?" asked she. "I seek wood for the King," answered the youth, "but this troublesome goat led me astray." The old woman chuckled, "Aye, goats wander. Sweep my floor clean and fetch water from the spring behind the house, and I can set you right, but keep that thistle-eater tied fast." The youth agreed readily, tied the goat to a sturdy sapling, swept the dusty floor till it shone, and fetched cool water, the sheepskin glove keeping his hand strong on the heavy bucket. But while he was at the spring, the goat gnawed through the rope, pushed open the cabin door which had not been latched properly, and began eating the dried herbs hanging from the rafters. The old woman returned and cried out in anger, "My winter herbs! You careless boy, did I not tell you to tie him fast?" "Now I will not help you find the path," she declared, "Be off with you and your cursed goat, but take this smooth grey stone; perhaps like seeks like in this wood." So the youth departed, sad at heart, with the troublesome goat trotting behind and the smooth grey stone heavy in his pocket, and he knew not which way to turn in the darkening wood.
The youth wandered for two days in the forest with little to eat, while the goat complained loudly if it did not find tasty leaves. At last they came to a great river, which flowed so swift and wide that no man might swim across. The youth sat down upon the bank and knew not what to do, but the goat cared naught for the river and began to chew contentedly on some weeds. Then the youth remembered the old woman's stone and her words 'like seeks like,' and took it out from his pocket. He wondered what she meant, and tossed it towards the water, and behold, the stone did not sink but floated upon the surface like a leaf. Then it grew longer and wider until it touched the other bank and became a narrow stone bridge. The youth marvelled and walked across, pulling the goat, which stopped halfway to try and look back, and nearly tumbled into the swift water below. When they were safely on the other side, the bridge shrank back into a smooth grey stone, and the youth saw a fat leather purse lying on the grass, filled with gold coins. The youth picked up the purse, which was heavy with gold, and thought, "This is welcome indeed, for my stomach is empty." He tucked the purse safely away and travelled onwards, with the goat skipping awkwardly ahead, already looking for trouble.
After another day's travel, they came at last to the gates of a great city where the King held his court. The goat promptly tried to eat the red plume from a guard's helmet, causing the guards to shout and people to stare. Now it happened that the youth's own twin brother, who had a wicked heart, stood watching in the crowd, and he looked so like the youth that none could tell them apart. The wicked brother saw the goat and saw the youth, who seemed simple and poor despite the purse the brother spied hidden beneath his cloak, and he thought wickedly to himself. He stepped forward through the crowd with a smiling face and said, "Greetings, brother! What strange beast have you brought to the city?" The youth was surprised to be called brother by a stranger dressed in fine clothes, but replied honestly, "This is my goat, though he is more stubborn than is good for him." "Indeed," said the wicked twin, "It is a pity to see you so ragged. Come with me to yon quiet alley, and let us trade clothes; yours are not fit for this city." The youth, seeing no harm and thinking fine clothes would be good, agreed, and in the alley they swapped garments, though the youth kept the worn sheepskin glove on his hand. But as soon as the clothes were swapped, the wicked twin snatched the purse from the youth's belt, seized the goat's rope, and ran off laughing, leaving the youth in his fine but unfamiliar clothes. The youth stood dismayed in the alley, the fine clothes feeling strange upon him, and realized he had been ill-used by the one who called him brother.
Having no choice, the youth made his way to the palace, hoping his finer clothes might gain him entry or some small work. It chanced that the King's daughter, who was fair to look upon, saw him from her window, and seeing his fine clothes, thought him some visiting prince. She sent a servant to inquire who that noble lord was who stood so forlornly by the palace gate. Meanwhile, the wicked twin was flaunting the purse in a tavern, whilst the goat chewed up a royal decree posted on the market square. When the servant asked his name and rank, the youth, ashamed of his plight and confused by the fine clothes, merely said, "I am but a traveller seeking my way." The servant reported this, which only piqued the princess's curiosity, and she bade the youth be brought to the palace garden where she sometimes walked. There, seeing a wilting rose bush, the youth knelt and tended to it with care, his gloved hand gentle on the thorns, and the princess watched him with approval. Just then, word came to the King of a richly-dressed stranger causing uproar in the city, spending gold freely, accompanied by a goat eating public notices. The princess, pleased with the youth's gentle ways, had just given him a fine silver locket, when guards rushed in, crying, "By order of the King, seize the troublemaker!" Before the princess could speak, the guards seized the bewildered youth and dragged him away to the palace dungeons.
The youth sat in the damp dungeon, knowing not how to explain about a wicked twin brother and traded clothes. The wicked twin heard the news of the arrest and rejoiced, seeing his chance to perhaps even gain favour at the palace himself. But the princess, recalling the youth's gentle tending of the rose, did not believe him guilty of uproar and resolved to discover the truth. Disguised as a merchant's daughter, she went into the city and soon found the infamous goat tied to a tavern post, looking quite forlorn. She tried to lead the goat away gently, thinking to question its master later, but the goat planted its feet, refused to budge, and set up a loud bleating. The loud bleating drew the wicked twin from the tavern, annoyed that his stolen goat was making such a noise, and he came to fetch it. The princess saw he was the image of the youth in the dungeon, and devised a clever plan, saying sweetly, "Good sir, your goat seems unwilling; perhaps only its true master can make it move?" The twin scoffed, "Of course I am its master!" and took the rope, pulling with all his might, but the goat leaned back and would not stir an inch, bleating louder still. Then the Princess declared loudly to the gathering crowd and the arriving guards, "This man cannot be the goat's true master, nor the one I saw earlier! Seize him, for he is an imposter!" and ordered the true youth released and rewarded with a fine horse and armour. The wicked twin was seized, and by the King's decree, as punishment for his deceit and troublemaking, he was tied firmly to the back of the stubborn goat, which immediately bolted through the city and out into the wilderness, never to be seen again.
The youth was freed from the dungeon and brought before the King and the princess, who looked kindly upon him. He then told his tale, of seeking wood for the King, of the old woman's stone and the river, and how his wicked twin had tricked him and stolen his purse and the troublesome goat, leaving him only the sheepskin glove. The King listened gravely and said, "You have suffered much due to your brother's malice; the kingdom is in your debt for your honesty, though you brought no wood." The youth then showed them the old sheepskin glove, and let the captain of the guard try to cut it with his sword, but the blade could not mark it. The King and all the court marvelled greatly at the glove, saying it was surely a sign of great fortune to come. The princess especially looked upon him with favour, remembering his kindness to the rose bush as much as the magical glove. Then the King declared, "A youth who faces such trials with honesty, and whom fortune favours with such gifts, is worthy indeed! You shall marry my daughter!" The youth accepted with great joy, for the princess was as good as she was fair. There was a great wedding feast which lasted seven days, and no one missed the stubborn goat at all, least of all the palace guards. And the youth and the princess lived happily together, ruled wisely after the old King, and he often used the sheepskin glove when gardening, finding it never wore thin.
