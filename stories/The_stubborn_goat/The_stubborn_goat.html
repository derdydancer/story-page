var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "Establishes the protagonist and his initial state of poverty and responsibility, introducing the problematic goat. Sets a humble beginning common in these tales.", "Grimm Style": "Begins by introducing a character defined by his role and lack (\"poor youth\"). Uses simple, declarative structure. Introduces the goat as a key element. Adheres to simple vocabulary.", "Moral Implication": "Sets up a situation of hardship and responsibility, perhaps hinting at future tests of patience or resourcefulness related to the goat.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The poor youth represents the humble Ego at the start of its journey. The goat, an animal known for stubbornness and instinct, could symbolize a difficult, intractable part of the youth's own nature, his circumstances, or a burden he must manage (the Shadow aspect of everyday struggle).", "Sentence": "There was once a poor youth who had nothing in the world but a small hut, a sharp axe, and a goat that would never do as it was bid.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "Emphasizes the goat's defining characteristic (stubbornness) with a specific, slightly humorous example, establishing it as a source of conflict.", "Grimm Style": "Simple sentence focusing on action (or lack thereof). Uses concrete detail (gate, thistle). The humor is situational and arises from the animal's unreasonable behavior, fitting the style.", "Moral Implication": "Highlights the challenges of dealing with obstinate forces or beings. Foreshadows future troubles caused by the goat.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The goat's refusal to move exemplifies the stubborn, irrational aspect it represents. It actively resists the Ego's direction (youth's pull), preferring its own contrary desire (thistle). This symbolizes internal resistance or external obstacles that defy logic.", "Sentence": "If the youth pulled it towards the gate, it would plant its feet firm; if he tried to lead it from a fine thistle, it would cry to eat it.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces a task set by a higher authority (the King) and a potential reward, providing motivation for the youth beyond mere survival. Links the task to the forest, an archetypal setting.", "Grimm Style": "Introduces royalty (\"King\") and a task (\"fetch wood\"). Mentions a reward (\"silver coin\"), a simple, tangible incentive. Uses the archetypal forest setting. Follows clear cause-effect structure (decree -> youth acts).", "Moral Implication": "Opportunity arises even for the poor. Reward is offered for labor. Introduces the need to venture into the potentially dangerous forest.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The King represents societal order or a higher calling (Superego or Self impulse) setting a task for the Ego. The task involves venturing into the Unconscious (forest) to gather resources (wood = raw material, energy). The silver coin is an initial, external motivation.", "Sentence": "Now, the King of that land needed wood for his great hall, and let it be known that any man who brought a full cord from the deep forest should receive a silver coin.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "The youth decides to undertake the task, linking his troublesome goat to the endeavor, setting up inevitable complications.", "Grimm Style": "Simple statement of intent (\"youth thought to try\"). Includes the goat, connecting the established conflict element to the new quest. Uses straightforward language.", "Moral Implication": "Shows initiative and willingness to work despite potential difficulties (the goat). Necessity drives action.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (youth) decides to undertake the task set by the higher authority, but must bring along the difficult, stubborn element (goat) \u2013 representing perhaps his limitations, his shadow, or an inseparable burden he cannot yet shed.", "Sentence": "The youth thought to try his fortune, and on the morrow, he took his axe and set out for the forest, dragging the unwilling goat behind him with a rope.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 4}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces the magic item \u2013 the sheepskin glove \u2013 found unexpectedly. Establishes its magical property (indestructibility).", "Grimm Style": "Introduces a magical object found by chance. Simple description (\"old sheepskin glove\"). States its magic property directly (\"never wear out\"). Typical discovery of a helpful item. Adheres to Magic Item list conventions (Part 4).", "Moral Implication": "Fortune favors the active; finding the glove suggests a reward for setting out on the task. Hints that unseen help may be available.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "On the path into the Unconscious (forest), the Ego finds a magical tool. The glove (protecting the hand, the instrument of action) that never wears out symbolizes resilience, enduring strength, or a protective aspect granted by fate or the unconscious itself. It\u2019s found, not earned initially.", "Sentence": "As he walked along the path, his foot struck something soft, and behold, it was an old sheepskin glove, which felt strangely tough, as if it would never wear out.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "The youth utilizes the magic item immediately for a practical, mundane purpose, integrating it into his task.", "Grimm Style": "Simple action showing the use of the magic item (\"put it on his right hand\"). Connects it to the task (\"grip his axe better\"). Matter-of-fact use of magic.", "Moral Implication": "Practicality; making use of unexpected gifts. The magic aids his labor.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego immediately integrates the newfound resilient quality (glove) into his conscious work (wielding the axe). This symbolizes applying inner strength or protection to the task at hand.", "Sentence": "The youth picked it up and put it on his right hand, thinking it would help him grip his axe better.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 6}, {"Plot Function": "The goat begins causing trouble as soon as they enter the forest, immediately complicating the task. Humorous element of the goat eating something inappropriate.", "Grimm Style": "Action shifts back to the conflict source (goat). Situational humor (eating moss). Simple sentence structure. Sets up the next plot point.", "Moral Implication": "Obstacles persist. The nature of the goat doesn't change just because the setting does. Trouble follows familiar patterns.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Upon entering the Unconscious (forest), the stubborn, irrational element (goat) immediately creates problems, consuming something of little value (moss) instead of facilitating the task. This shows how ingrained patterns or shadow aspects interfere with progress.", "Sentence": "They had not gone far into the trees when the goat began to chew upon some green moss growing on a fallen log.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 7}, {"Plot Function": "The youth tries to redirect the goat, leading to a struggle that moves them deeper and potentially off the intended path.", "Grimm Style": "Describes simple actions (pulling, goat resisting). Shows movement (\"stumbled deeper\"). Uses direct cause and effect (struggle leads to going deeper).", "Moral Implication": "Struggling against stubbornness can lead one astray or into unforeseen territory. Sometimes direct confrontation isn't the best method.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego's attempt to control the stubborn element (goat) by force leads them deeper into the Unconscious (forest), away from the intended path or task. This suggests that wrestling directly with resistant parts of the psyche can lead one further into complexity or disorientation.", "Sentence": "The youth pulled at the rope, but the goat pulled back, and they stumbled deeper amongst the shadowed trees.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 8}, {"Plot Function": "The struggle leads to an unexpected discovery \u2013 a hidden cabin \u2013 introducing a new element into the forest setting.", "Grimm Style": "Uses \"At last\" to signal a change. Unexpected discovery (\"came upon a little cabin\"). Simple description (\"hidden amongst ferns\"). Sets up a potential encounter or new stage.", "Moral Implication": "Sometimes struggle or going off the beaten path leads to unexpected findings. What seems like a problem can lead to something new.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The struggle with the resistant element (goat) leads the Ego to a hidden structure within the Unconscious (cabin). This could represent a previously unknown complex, a forgotten aspect of the self, or the dwelling place of another unconscious figure.", "Sentence": "At last, the goat tripped on a root, and the youth fell forward, and when he looked up, they had come upon a little cabin hidden amongst ferns.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 9}, {"Plot Function": "Raises a question about the cabin's inhabitant, creating minor suspense and ending the chapter on a note of uncertainty before the next stage.", "Grimm Style": "Simple observation leading to a question (implied or direct). Focuses on external detail (no smoke). Ends the introductory phase, ready for the next development.", "Moral Implication": "Curiosity about the unknown. Signs (no smoke) suggest abandonment or perhaps something unusual.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego observes the hidden structure (cabin) and notes its lack of apparent life (no smoke), raising questions about its nature or inhabitant. It signifies encountering a part of the unconscious that seems dormant or mysterious.", "Sentence": "No smoke came from the chimney, and the door was fast shut.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 10}, {"Plot Function": "Driven by curiosity or need, the youth investigates the cabin, leading to the next interaction. The goat's involvement continues the humor/conflict.", "Grimm Style": "Simple action (\"knocked on the door\"). Continued presence of the goat, adding a touch of absurdity (\"goat tried to eat the door latch\"). Direct and advances the plot.", "Moral Implication": "Taking initiative to investigate the unknown. Obstacles (goat's behavior) persist even during moments of curiosity or need.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (youth) decides to interact with the mysterious unconscious structure (cabin). The stubborn/instinctual element (goat) immediately tries to engage in a nonsensical, destructive way (eating the latch), symbolizing how primal impulses can interfere with conscious investigation.", "Sentence": "The youth knocked on the door, whilst the goat tried to eat the door latch.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 11}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces a new character, an old woman, who responds to the knock. Establishes her appearance and potential archetype (old woman of the woods).", "Grimm Style": "Introduces an archetypal character (\"very old woman\"). Simple description (\"wrinkled face,\" \"sharp eyes\"). Direct action (\"opened the door a crack\"). Creates potential for help or hindrance.", "Moral Implication": "Encounters in the forest often involve solitary, potentially magical figures. Appearances can be deceiving (sharp eyes despite age).", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The hidden structure (cabin) is inhabited by the Wise Old Woman archetype (or Crone aspect of the feminine). She represents ancient wisdom, intuition, or the hidden aspect of the unconscious. Her \"sharp eyes\" suggest perception beyond the surface. She cautiously reveals herself (\"opened... a crack\").", "Sentence": "Presently, the door opened a crack, and a very old woman with a wrinkled face and sharp eyes looked out.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 12}, {"Plot Function": "The old woman poses a direct question, demanding the youth's purpose, a common trope for threshold guardians or helpers.", "Grimm Style": "Direct question (\"What seek you...?\").
