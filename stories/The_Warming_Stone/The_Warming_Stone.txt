The Warming Stone
There lived once a poor widow at the edge of a dark wood, and she had but one son. The son gathered sticks in the wood every day, that they might have a fire. One day he went deeper into the wood than he was wont. There he saw an old man with a long white beard, whom he had never before seen, sitting upon a stone, and the man looked kindly upon him. The old man said, 'Child, why do you gather sticks so far from your home?' 'My mother and I are poor,' answered the boy, 'and we need wood for our fire, but near the cottage there is little left.' The old man nodded, and gave the boy a small, smooth stone, saying, 'Take this, and as long as it is on your hearth, you shall never want for fire.' The boy thanked the man and ran home as fast as his legs could carry him. He reached the cottage and placed the stone upon the cold hearth. At once a bright flame leaped up from the stone, and warmth filled the little room as never before.
The widow and her son lived for some time in comfort and warmth, thanks to the burning stone. But then word came through the land of the highest judge in his black robes, who passed hard judgments upon all. This judge travelled the land and set up his court in the market town nearby, and great fear fell upon the people. About this time, a bright light was seen at night in the hills beyond the dark wood. From this light, a traveler came walking down into the villages, whose face shone, and who had great kindness in his eyes, and spoke gently to all he met. He healed the sick with the touch of his hand and comforted the sorrowful. It was whispered among the folk that he was surely sent from heaven, or perhaps was an angel. Now it happened that the gentle traveler and the stern judge came both to the market town, and their paths crossed in the main square. The judge in his black robes stopped, and looked hard at the traveler, and spoke sharply, saying, 'Who are you that walks here doing such works?' 'I am a friend to all,' answered the traveler, and smiled gently, but the judge only scowled the more.
The judge gave his guards a dark look and said, 'This man is stirring up the people with false works; seize him!' The guards stepped forward at once and laid rough hands upon the traveler, but he did not resist them. They led him away and cast him into a dark cellar beneath the court house, which had cold stone walls and no light at all. Then the judge proclaimed that it was forbidden for any man to speak the traveler's name, on pain of punishment. The people were afraid, and spoke only in whispers of the traveler and his works of kindness. Now the widow's son, in his cottage by the wood, heard the news of what had passed in the town, as news travels, and he grew troubled. He thought of the old man in the wood who had given him the stone, and it seemed to him that the traveler's eyes were alike in their kindness. He said to himself, 'I must go to the town and see if this is true.' He told his mother he was going to seek work, and the next morning set out upon the road. When he reached the town, he found an air of fear hanging over it, though the market square was busy.
The boy lingered near the court house, listening to the talk of the townsfolk. He heard whispers that the kind traveler was still locked in the cellar, and that guards stood always at the door. The boy thought to himself, 'Somehow I must find a way to reach that cellar.' He looked for work nearby, and soon found a man who needed help carrying water to the guards of the court house. The boy agreed at once, hoping for a chance to see the cellar door. He carried heavy buckets back and forth, and saw the guards standing before a stout wooden door at the side of the building. The guards seemed weary from the heat and paid little heed to the water carrier. He waited until dusk when one guard left for a moment, and then he darted quickly to the door. He saw a heavy iron key was left in the lock, and the lock was not turned. With trembling hands, he turned the key, opened the heavy door just enough, and slipped inside without a sound.
It was pitch dark within, and cold and damp, but in the far corner, he saw a faint light. The light shone from the traveler himself, who sat on the floor with heavy chains on his wrists. The traveler looked up as the boy entered, and it seemed he knew the boy at once. 'Child,' he whispered, his voice gentle still, 'why have you come to this place of danger?' 'I came to help you,' said the boy, 'for your eyes are like the old man's in the wood, and I looked at the chains, wondering how to set you free.' 'You cannot break these chains, for they are not of earthly make,' the traveler said softly, 'Do not try, but listen closely.' 'The stone upon your hearth, given by the old man – bring it here and touch the locks of these chains.' The boy understood he must be quick before the guard returned; he nodded and stole away as quietly as he had come. He ran through the dark streets back to the cottage, took the stone from the hearth (which was still warm to the touch), and hid it beneath his coat. He returned to the court house, found the guard was still absent from the door, and slipped back into the dark cellar.
He took out the warm stone and touched it to the heavy iron locks on the traveler's chains, and at once they fell open without a sound. The traveler rose to his feet, and seemed to stand tall, and the faint light about him grew brighter. 'You have done well, child,' the traveler said, his voice like quiet music, 'This deed will not be forgotten. But we must go now, quickly, before the guard returns.' He led the way to the door, opened it carefully, and looked out into the alley; the street was empty. Together they stepped out and hurried away through the dark streets, turning towards the hills from which the traveler had first come. By sunrise, they had reached the edge of the dark wood near the boy's own cottage. The traveler stopped and said, 'Return now to your mother. The stone will still serve you well, and you need fear the judge no longer. Go in peace.' Then he turned, and strode into the deep wood, and in a moment was lost to sight among the trees. The boy watched him go, then went to the cottage where his mother rejoiced to see him safe. He found the stone still burned brightly on the hearth, and soon word came from the town that the highest judge had vanished as suddenly as he had come, and the fear was lifted from the land.
So the years went by, and the widow's son lived peacefully with his mother, and the stone warmed their hearth. The boy grew into a man, tall and strong, but quiet in his ways. He often thought of the old man in the wood, and of the traveler in the cellar, and wondered if they were one and the same. Then it happened that his mother grew old and fell ill. No physic could cure her, and a wise woman of the village said it was a sickness born of deep sorrow. Her son asked his mother what sorrow weighed upon her heart. She was silent for a long time, then said, 'One thing I have never told you, concerning your father.' 'Your father was a huntsman in the king's service, good and brave, but one day he went into the dark wood and never returned.' 'This was before you were born, and some said he was taken by strange magic deep within the trees.' 'My sorrow for him has remained always in my heart, and his image is ever before me,' she finished, weeping softly.
Then the son understood the source of her illness, and he said, 'Mother, weep no more, for I will go into the wood and seek my father, or learn his fate, that your heart may find peace.' He made ready, and at the next dawn, he took the warming stone from the hearth and put it in his pouch. He entered the dark wood where he had met the old man, but went far deeper than ever before, where the trees grew thick and the paths vanished. He did not know the way, but held the stone in his hand, and felt a faint warmth guiding him forward between the ancient trees. After three days of walking thus, he came to a hidden clearing, and in its center stood a tall tower made of black, lightless stone. The tower had no windows, only one great iron door, and this door stood slightly ajar. Taking courage, the young man pushed open the heavy door and stepped inside. Within was a single large room, lit by dark lamps, and at a heavy table sat a figure robed all in black, writing in a great book with a quill pen. The figure looked up, and the young man saw that the face was the face of the highest judge who had vanished from the town. 'What do you seek here, boy,' said the judge, his voice cold as ice, 'in my private domain?'
'I seek my father,' the young man answered steadily, 'a huntsman lost to this wood long ago.' The judge stared at him for a long moment, then pointed with a bony finger to the great book upon the table. 'Look for yourself then,' he said, 'if you dare know the fate of those who trespass too deep.' The young man stepped forward, his hand steady, and opened the great, heavy book. Its pages were filled with names, and alongside each name, a fate was written, and soon he found his father's name. Beside it was written: 'Held here by my power, until a debt is paid.' The young man looked up from the book and asked the black-robed figure, 'What debt does my father owe?' The judge replied, his voice grating like stone on stone, 'He owes a debt of light, a borrowed brightness he took from the one you freed, and could not repay when his helper was chained.' 'Then I will pay this debt,' said the young man, 'Let me use my own light, from the stone given me, to settle his account.' The judge considered this, his dark eyes gleaming, then slowly nodded. 'So be it. We shall see if the stone's light suffices.'
He rose from his chair and led the young man through another door hidden behind a dark curtain. There, in a small, bare room, sat an old huntsman, thin and pale, staring at the floor. He looked up slowly as they entered, but did not seem to know his own son. The young man took out the warming stone from his pouch and held it before his father. The stone's light flared brightly, and as it shone upon the huntsman, some colour returned to his face and his eyes cleared. The judge stared at the stone, then at the huntsman, and said grudgingly, 'The debt is paid.' He turned away back to his book. The old huntsman now knew his son, and embraced him with tears in his eyes. The young man led his father out of the black tower and into the sunlit clearing. Together they made their way back through the wood, the stone still guiding them, and at last reached the cottage. When the widow saw her husband restored, her deep sorrow lifted at once, and the three lived together in peace, and the stone burned bright upon their hearth always.
