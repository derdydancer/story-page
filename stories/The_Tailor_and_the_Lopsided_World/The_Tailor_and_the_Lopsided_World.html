var analysisData = [{"Grimm Style": "Formulaic opening \"Once upon a time\". Simple character description (tailor, poor). Simple sentence structure. Concrete details related to his trade implied.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Tailor represents the Ego in a state of lack or limitation (\"poor\"). His trade involves mending and shaping (Persona work, adapting to the world), but currently ineffectively.", "Moral Implication": "Introduces the theme of poverty and perhaps the value of hard work or the need for fortune.", "Plot Function": "Establishes the protagonist (a tailor) and his initial state (poverty, struggling). Sets the scene simply.", "Sentence": "Once upon a time there dwelt a poor tailor who had barely enough thread to sew a patch."}, {"Grimm Style": "Simple transition (\"One morning\"). Introduces an action. Dialogue tag \"said he.\" Unusual request described matter-of-factly.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "An unexpected demand from the outer world (customer/request) challenges the Ego's current state. The strangeness suggests it might come from an unconventional part of the psyche or reality.", "Moral Implication": "Opportunity can arise unexpectedly. Tests the tailor's willingness to take on strange tasks.", "Plot Function": "Introduces an inciting incident. A strange request arrives, creating an opportunity or challenge.", "Sentence": "One morning, a very round man with a voice like a squeaky hinge came to his door and said, 'Tailor, I need you to sew buttons on the wind.'"}, {"Grimm Style": "Simple response. Dialogue focuses on the practical impossibility. Direct and unadorned.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (tailor) initially reacts with rational objection to the seemingly impossible task demanded by the unusual figure (round man/unconscious demand?). It tries to apply ordinary logic (\"cannot sew on wind\").", "Moral Implication": "Points out the difference between reasonable work and absurdity. Common sense reaction.", "Plot Function": "Shows the protagonist's initial, logical reaction to the impossible task. Highlights the absurdity.", "Sentence": "The tailor looked at his needle, then at the door where the wind blew leaves past, and answered, 'Good sir, one cannot sew on the wind.'"}, {"Grimm Style": "Dialogue used to advance plot. Insistence (\"you must try\"). Offer of reward (\"great reward\") is a common motivator. Ignores logic.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The demanding force (round man) insists, overriding the Ego's rational objections. The \"great reward\" symbolizes the potential gain from engaging with this non-rational demand, perhaps integration or transformation.", "Moral Implication": "Persistence (even illogical) can overcome initial refusal. The lure of reward can make one attempt the impossible.", "Plot Function": "The customer overcomes the tailor's objection with insistence and perhaps a tempting offer, forcing the plot forward.", "Sentence": "'Nevertheless,' squeaked the round man, 'you must try, and there will be a great reward if the buttons hold even for an hour.'"}, {"Grimm Style": "Simple statement of agreement or decision. Action-oriented (\"took up his needle\"). Shows acceptance despite absurdity.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (tailor), perhaps motivated by need (poverty) or the promise of gain (reward), agrees to engage with the non-rational task. He takes up his tools (needle = focused conscious effort) to apply to the intangible (wind).", "Moral Implication": "Sometimes one must attempt the seemingly impossible, perhaps out of desperation or hope for reward. Willingness to try.", "Plot Function": "The protagonist accepts the challenge, setting the main action in motion.", "Sentence": "So the tailor, thinking of his empty pantry, took up his needle and three bright brass buttons he had been saving."}, {"Grimm Style": "Describes action literally and simply. Focus on the physical struggle (\"jabbed,\" \"wind snatched\"). Direct and visual. Comedic effect through the impossible physics.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego attempts to apply its usual methods (sewing) to the intangible, chaotic force (wind). The failure (\"needle passed through,\" \"wind snatched\") shows the inadequacy of conventional conscious tools/methods for controlling such forces directly.", "Moral Implication": "Illustrates the foolishness of the task literally. Perseverance in the face of guaranteed failure?", "Plot Function": "Shows the execution of the attempt, highlighting its difficulty and absurdity.", "Sentence": "He went outside, held up a button, and tried to jab his needle where the wind blew strongest, but the needle passed through naught, and the wind snatched the button away."}, {"Grimm Style": "Repetition of action and failure. Simple description. Round man as observer adds pressure or absurdity.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Repeated attempts with the same inadequate conscious method lead to further loss (buttons = perhaps energy, focus, or concrete resources). The demanding figure (round man) watches, representing the persistent pressure from the source of the task.", "Moral Implication": "Trying the same failed method yields the same failed result. Loss accumulates through foolish attempts.", "Plot Function": "Reinforces the impossibility and the tailor's growing loss (buttons). Builds the comic frustration. Introduces the observer.", "Sentence": "He tried again with the second button, holding it tighter, but the wind twisted it from his fingers, and the round man watching from the doorway only tapped his foot."}, {"Grimm Style": "Shows problem-solving. Simple action (\"looked about\"). Finds a mundane object (leaf). Connects the impossible (wind) to the tangible (leaf) via the button.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego, facing complete failure with direct methods, seeks an indirect approach. Attaching the button (focus/intent) to a leaf (a natural, transient object moved *by* the wind) represents working *with* the intangible force indirectly, using a natural symbol or intermediary.", "Moral Implication": "Necessity sparks invention. Thinking differently when the direct approach fails. Using intermediaries.", "Plot Function": "Facing final failure, the protagonist tries a different approach, showing ingenuity born of desperation.", "Sentence": "With the last button, the tailor looked about, saw a large dry leaf skittering past, and quickly sewed the button onto the leaf."}, {"Grimm Style": "Describes the action clearly (\"tossed the leaf,\" \"wind caught it,\" \"button danced\"). Visual and active. Simple cause and effect.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "By attaching the conscious intent (button) to a natural, receptive element (leaf), the Ego allows the intangible force (wind) to interact with it indirectly. The button \"dances,\" showing engagement and movement, a form of success achieved by yielding and indirectness rather than control.", "Moral Implication": "Cleverness finds a way. Redefining success based on the constraints. Working with forces rather than against them.", "Plot Function": "Shows the outcome of the innovative solution. The button is now subject to the wind via the leaf. A kind of success, albeit absurd.", "Sentence": "He then tossed the leaf into the air, and the wind caught it at once, sending it tumbling and spinning down the lane, the brass button flashing as it danced."}, {"Grimm Style": "Customer's reaction described simply (\"clapped his hands,\" \"laughed\"). Direct speech confirms acceptance. Reward given (\"small pouch\"). Character departs. Typical interaction pattern completed. Comedic resolution.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The demanding figure (round man) accepts the Ego's indirect, symbolic solution. The laughter signifies the playful or non-rational nature of the source. The reward (pouch) represents the gain from successfully engaging with the unconscious demand, even symbolically. The figure departs, the immediate pressure resolved.", "Moral Implication": "Unconventional solutions can be accepted. Success can come from unexpected interpretations. Reward for cleverness.", "Plot Function": "Resolves the initial conflict. The customer accepts the solution, provides the reward, and potentially departs. Sets up the next stage.", "Sentence": "The round man clapped his hands, laughed a squeaky laugh, and said, 'It holds! It holds on the wind!' Then he gave the tailor a small, heavy pouch and rolled away down the street like a barrel."}, {"Grimm Style": "Simple action (\"opened the pouch\"). Describes contents concretely (\"not gold or silver,\" \"smooth, grey stones\"). Creates mystery around the value of the reward.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The reward gained from engaging the non-rational task is not conventional psychic wealth (gold/silver = obvious value) but something seemingly mundane yet significant (\"smooth, grey stones\"). These might represent foundational elements, primal matter, potential, or perhaps burdens. Their true nature is hidden.", "Moral Implication": "Rewards may not be what they seem. Value isn't always obvious (gold/silver). Tests the tailor's perception or patience.", "Plot Function": "Reveals the nature of the reward, creating intrigue and leading to the next plot point.", "Sentence": "The tailor opened the pouch, but found not gold or silver, but twelve smooth, grey stones, each no bigger than his thumb."}, {"Grimm Style": "Expresses reaction through action (\"felt disappointment,\" stated simply or implied). Action of discarding (\"tossed one onto the refuse heap\"). Shows misjudgment of value.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (tailor), expecting conventional reward, is disappointed by the seemingly worthless outcome (stones). Discarding one represents rejecting or failing to recognize the value of the potential gained from the unconscious encounter. This is a common motif \u2013 the hero initially misunderstands the gift of the donor figure.", "Moral Implication": "Judging value too quickly by appearance. Impatience or lack of insight can lead to discarding something precious.", "Plot Function": "Shows the protagonist's initial reaction to the disappointing reward. Sets up a potential consequence for discarding one.", "Sentence": "He felt disappointment bite him, and thinking himself cheated, he tossed one grey stone onto the refuse heap behind his cottage."}, {"Grimm Style": "Time marker (\"Next morning\"). Describes a surprising transformation (\"stone had sprouted,\" \"tiny silver tree\"). Matter-of-fact tone for the magical event.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The discarded potential (stone) reveals its true nature when left unattended or returned to the 'refuse heap' (perhaps the personal unconscious). It \"sprouts,\" symbolizing growth and transformation, becoming a \"silver tree\" \u2013 silver often linked to the moon, the feminine, intuition, hidden value. The unconscious works on the rejected potential.", "Moral Implication": "Things are not always as they seem. Hidden value revealed. The consequences of discarding something potentially precious.", "Plot Function": "Reveals the magical property of the stones, correcting the tailor's misjudgment and introducing a supernatural element.", "Sentence": "Next morning, however, he saw that the stone on the refuse heap had sprouted roots and grown into a tiny, perfect tree made of pure silver."}, {"Grimm Style": "Shows realization through action (\"ran quickly,\" \"gathered up\"). Contrasting emotion implied by action (carefulness now vs. carelessness before). Simple and direct.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (tailor) recognizes the true value of the seemingly mundane reward (stones = potential). He now carefully gathers the remaining potential, understanding its transformative power (silver tree = manifestation of inner value).", "Moral Implication": "Learning from mistakes. Recognizing true value after a demonstration. Opportunity grasped before it's all lost.", "Plot Function": "The protagonist understands the value of the reward and secures the remaining items. Sets him on a new path, managing this newfound resource.", "Sentence": "The tailor gasped, ran quickly to gather up the other eleven stones, and stored them carefully in his empty thread box."}, {"Grimm Style": "Simple action based on the discovery (\"decided to plant\"). Shows methodical approach (\"in a clean pot,\" \"with good earth\"). Learning and applying knowledge.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego consciously decides to cultivate the potential (plant another stone). Using a \"clean pot\" and \"good earth\" symbolizes providing a proper conscious container and nurturing environment for the unconscious potential to grow, unlike the careless discard onto the 'refuse heap'.", "Moral Implication": "Curiosity and experimentation. Trying to replicate success. Applying care to potential resources.", "Plot Function": "The protagonist experiments with the magical items to understand them better and potentially benefit more. Drives the plot through utilizing the magic.", "Sentence": "That evening, he took another stone and planted it carefully in a clean pot with good earth from the woods nearby."}, {"Grimm Style": "Time marker (\"By morning\"). Describes the result (\"another tree\"). Specific material (\"shining copper\"). Adds a thematic detail (\"hung with tiny golden needles\"). Links back to his profession. Mildly comic image.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Conscious cultivation (careful planting) yields results. A tree grows, but of copper (associated with Venus, earthly love, perhaps practical value) instead of silver (moon, intuition). The \"golden needles\" directly link the manifestation to the Ego's profession (tailor), suggesting the unconscious potential manifests in forms relevant to the Ego's conscious identity and skills.", "Moral Implication": "Consistent results from careful action. The magic is reliable but perhaps slightly unpredictable (copper, not silver). Rewards careful cultivation.", "Plot Function": "Confirms the magical property and potentially reveals more about how it works. Provides the tailor with more wealth/resource. Adds a detail, maybe related to his trade.", "Sentence": "By morning, another tree stood there, this one of shining copper, and hung with tiny golden needles."}, {"Grimm Style": "Focus on observation (\"saw it was different\"). Simple statement of understanding or observation. No deep analysis, just noticing the facts.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego observes the different manifestation, learning that cultivating the potential (stones) doesn't always produce the exact same result. The unconscious expression varies (silver vs. copper/needles).", "Moral Implication": "Observation is key to understanding. Magic may have variations.", "Plot Function": "Shows the protagonist learning about the magic items. He observes the variation.", "Sentence": "The tailor saw it was different from the silver one and understood the stones were not all the same in their magic."}, {"Grimm Style": "Simple, practical action (\"plucked a needle\"). Uses it for his trade (\"began to sew\"). Shows the utility of the magic item.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego begins to integrate the manifested potential (golden needles) into its conscious life and work (sewing). This represents using the insights or energies gained from the unconscious to enhance worldly skills and effectiveness.", "Moral Implication": "Using newfound resources wisely. Magic serving a practical purpose. Bridging the magical and mundane.", "Plot Function": "The protagonist starts to utilize the magical resources for practical gain, connecting the magic back to his original problem (poverty).", "Sentence": "He carefully plucked a golden needle from the copper tree, threaded it with his common thread, and began to sew a waistcoat for the mayor."}, {"Grimm Style": "Describes the magical effect directly (\"needle flew,\" \"stitched by itself\"). Uses hyperbole (\"perfect stitches,\" \"sang tiny songs\"). Visual and auditory humor.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "When the Ego uses the tool derived from the cultivated unconscious potential (golden needle), its work becomes effortless, perfect, and even joyful (\"needle flew,\" \"sang tiny songs\"). This symbolizes the state of flow or inspired creativity that occurs when conscious skills are infused with energy from the Self/unconscious.", "Moral Implication": "Magic makes work easy and perfect. The reward for his earlier troubles and cleverness.", "Plot Function": "Shows the power of the magical item in action. Provides a source of success for the tailor.

The world might react unexpectedly.", "Plot Function": "Shows an immediate, perhaps unexpected or comical, consequence of manipulating the 'sky'. Introduces a reaction from the cosmos itself.", "Sentence": "As he pulled the thread tight, he thought he heard a distant, mighty 'Ouch!' from the direction of the sun."}, {"Grimm Style": "Shows decision based on the previous event (\"startled,\" \"decided one stitch was enough\"). Action (\"prepared to climb down\"). Moves the plot towards resolution of this adventure.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego, perhaps startled by the unexpected reaction from the higher realm or deeming the minimal intervention sufficient, decides to cease manipulation. It prepares to return to its ordinary level of consciousness, bringing back the experience of the ascent and the strange interaction.", "Moral Implication": "Knowing when to stop. Recognizing potential danger or respecting mysterious reactions. Discretion after achieving a minimal result.", "Plot Function": "The protagonist decides to stop the task, either satisfied or scared. Initiates the return journey.", "Sentence": "Startled, the tailor decided one stitch was quite enough adjustment for one day and prepared to climb down the long thread."}, {"Grimm Style": "Simple observation (\"looked down\"). Describes the helper's action (\"thread man was already winding\"). Creates immediate peril/urgency (\"thread was shrinking\"). Comical predicament.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The pathway back to ordinary consciousness (thread) is retracting, controlled by the autonomous function (thread man) that created it. This symbolizes that access to higher states or the pathway itself might not remain open indefinitely; the return must be timely, or the Ego risks being stranded or falling. The unconscious function operates on its own schedule.", "Moral Implication": "Helpers can be unreliable or have their own timing. Dangers on the return journey. Need for haste.", "Plot Function": "Creates urgency and comedy for the descent. The helper figure acts independently again, creating a new problem.", "Sentence": "He looked down and saw, to his alarm, that the thread man below had already begun winding the thread back up, shouting 'Tidying up! Tidying up!'"}, {"Grimm Style": "Describes the action vividly (\"slid down,\" \"faster and faster\"). Sensory detail (\"hands grew hot\"). Simple comparison (\"like a drop of rain\"). Focus on speed and descent.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego makes a rapid, uncontrolled descent from the higher state (sliding down the shrinking thread). This represents the swift return to ordinary consciousness, potentially losing some of the altitude or perspective gained due to the retracting pathway. It's a crash landing rather than a controlled climb down.", "Moral Implication": "Haste required in perilous situations. The speed of falling from great heights (literal or metaphorical).", "Plot Function": "Shows the perilous and rapid return journey. Creates a final moment of tension and physical comedy.", "Sentence": "The tailor grasped the thread and slid down as fast as he could, faster and faster as the thread zipped upwards, making his hands grow hot."}, {"Grimm Style": "Describes the landing (\"landed in a heap\"). Simple statement of location (\"back in his yard\"). Helper returned to original state (\"thread man stood... fully wound\"). Resolution of the ascent/descent sequence.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego lands back in ordinary reality (yard), possibly disorganized (\"in a heap\") after the rapid descent. The autonomous function (thread man) is contained again (\"fully wound\"). The extraordinary journey is complete.", "Moral Implication": "Safe return after peril. Journeys end back where they started, but the traveller is changed. Order restored after the adventure.", "Plot Function": "Completes the return journey. Shows the protagonist safely back, albeit perhaps ruffled. The helper is back to normal.", "Sentence": "He landed in a heap in his own yard just as the last bit of thread zipped into the little thread man, who stood looking quite pleased with himself."}, {"Grimm Style": "Helper speaks (\"declared\"). Dialogue offers a summary judgment (\"Slightly better\"). Adds a final touch of absurdity (\"still a bit wobbly\"). Keeps the character consistent.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The autonomous function (thread man) offers its assessment of the 'adjustment' made by the Ego in the higher realm. Its judgment (\"Slightly better... still a bit wobbly\") reflects a non-rational, perhaps whimsical perspective on the state of reality or consciousness. It suggests improvement but not perfection, maintaining a degree of psychic 'wobble'.", "Moral Implication": "Perspective is subjective (thread man thinks it's better). Perfection is elusive ('still wobbly'). The comical nature of the helper's judgment.", "Plot Function": "Provides closure from the helper figure's perspective. Offers a final piece of comical wisdom or observation.", "Sentence": "'There!' the thread man declared proudly. 'Slightly better, I think, though perhaps still a bit wobbly on Tuesdays.'"}, {"Grimm Style": "Shows weariness through decision (\"had enough adventure\"). Action reflects decision (\"put the thread man back,\" \"placed the stones\"). Chooses containment again.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (tailor), weary from the demands of the autonomous psychic function (thread man) and the perils of the journey, chooses to contain both the function and the remaining potential (stones) again. He seeks a return to normalcy and conscious control after the overwhelming experiences.", "Moral Implication": "Sometimes stability is preferred over adventure. Knowing one's limits. Securing magical elements to prevent further chaos.", "Plot Function": "Shows the protagonist's reaction after the second adventure. He seeks stability and decides how to handle the magical elements going forward.", "Sentence": "The tailor, deciding he had had quite enough adventure for a lifetime, carefully picked up the little thread man and placed him back in the iron pot with the stones."}, {"Grimm Style": "Repeats the hiding action (\"put the lid on tight,\" \"buried it deeper\"). Emphasizes the security measure (\"deeper than before\"). Shows learning from the rival tailor incident.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego takes more robust measures to contain the unconscious potential and its autonomous manifestations (\"buried it deeper\"). This represents a stronger effort at repression or conscious control after the chaotic emergence.", "Moral Implication": "Taking extra precautions based on experience. Securing potentially troublesome magic very firmly.", "Plot Function": "Reinforces his decision for containment and security. Shows him taking stronger precautions.", "Sentence": "He put the heavy lid on tight, and this time he buried the pot even deeper beneath his hearthstone than before."}, {"Grimm Style": "Describes return to normalcy (\"lived quietly,\" \"worked diligently\"). Adds a lingering strange effect (\"sunrise seemed straighter,\" \"except on Tuesdays\"). Simple, matter-of-fact description of the slight oddity.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego returns to ordinary life and conscious work. However, the experience has left a subtle, persistent change in his perception of reality ('straighter sunrise'), though with recurring slight instability ('except on Tuesdays', echoing the thread man). This represents the lasting, though perhaps minor and quirky, impact of the encounter with higher/unconscious realms on the Ego's worldview.", "Moral Implication": "Life goes on after adventures. Some experiences leave small, strange marks on the world. Things are mostly normal, but not quite.", "Plot Function": "Shows the long-term situation. Life returns to (mostly) normal, but with a subtle, lasting reminder of the adventure. Provides a final touch of comedy.", "Sentence": "After that, the tailor lived quietly and worked diligently, and the sunrise did seem perhaps a little straighter most mornings, except, sometimes, on Tuesdays."}, {"Grimm Style": "Simple statement about the tool (\"golden needle\"). Describes its final state (\"looked like any other\"). Choice made (\"used plain steel\"). Shows a return to mundane methods.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The derived magical tool (golden needle) eventually loses its special quality or the Ego chooses to rely on ordinary conscious effort (plain steel) again, perhaps preferring stability over the unpredictable brilliance (and potential notice) that came with the magic.", "Moral Implication": "Magical aids may fade or be put aside. Contentment with ordinary means after extraordinary events.", "Plot Function": "Resolves the status of the magical tool (the needle).", "Sentence": "His first golden needle eventually faded until it looked like any other needle, and he used plain steel ones thereafter."}, {"Grimm Style": "Simple statement about the rival (\"old tailor\"). Describes a lasting effect (\"nose and ear sometimes itched\"). Adds a final touch of comedy and consequence.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The envious shadow aspect (old tailor) remains, but is marked by a lingering reminder (itch) of its failed attempt to usurp the Ego's power. It's a minor but persistent consequence.", "Moral Implication": "Some consequences, even minor ones, linger after wrongdoing. A reminder of his failed greed.", "Plot Function": "Provides closure on the antagonist subplot.", "Sentence": "And the envious old tailor across the street complained forever after that his nose and left ear sometimes itched fiercely for no reason at all."}, {"Grimm Style": "Describes occasional thought (\"sometimes wondered\"). Action shows restraint (\"left the pot buried\"). Simple statement of his choice.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego remains aware of the contained unconscious potential (pot under hearth) but consciously chooses not to disturb it again, prioritizing stability and conscious control over further exploration or unpredictable manifestations. Contentment with the integrated past experience.", "Moral Implication": "Wisdom in letting sleeping dogs lie? Choosing peace over potentially chaotic power. Respecting the boundary he created.", "Plot Function": "Shows the protagonist's final attitude towards the contained magic. Curiosity remains, but caution prevails.", "Sentence": "Sometimes, when the fire burned low, the prosperous tailor wondered about the pot beneath the hearth, but he always left it buried."}, {"Grimm Style": "Formulaic closing (\"And so he lived...\"). Simple statement of his state (\"content enough\"). Suggests continuity (\"to the end of his days\"). Typical fairy tale ending.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego finds lasting contentment in its ordinary life, having successfully navigated encounters with the unconscious, integrated some potential, managed autonomous complexes, and achieved stability. The individuation journey depicted reaches a state of peaceful resolution.", "Moral Implication": "Finding contentment in ordinary life after extraordinary adventures. Peace after turmoil. The story concludes.", "Plot Function": "Provides a definitive ending to the story.", "Sentence": "And so he lived, content enough and stitching neatly, to the end of his days."}];
