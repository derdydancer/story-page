The Tailor and the Lopsided World
Once upon a time there dwelt a poor tailor who had barely enough thread to sew a patch. One morning, a very round man with a voice like a squeaky hinge came to his door and said, 'Tailor, I need you to sew buttons on the wind.' The tailor looked at his needle, then at the door where the wind blew leaves past, and answered, 'Good sir, one cannot sew on the wind.' 'Nevertheless,' squeaked the round man, 'you must try, and there will be a great reward if the buttons hold even for an hour.' So the tailor, thinking of his empty pantry, took up his needle and three bright brass buttons he had been saving. He went outside, held up a button, and tried to jab his needle where the wind blew strongest, but the needle passed through naught, and the wind snatched the button away. He tried again with the second button, holding it tighter, but the wind twisted it from his fingers, and the round man watching from the doorway only tapped his foot. With the last button, the tailor looked about, saw a large dry leaf skittering past, and quickly sewed the button onto the leaf. He then tossed the leaf into the air, and the wind caught it at once, sending it tumbling and spinning down the lane, the brass button flashing as it danced. The round man clapped his hands, laughed a squeaky laugh, and said, 'It holds! It holds on the wind!' Then he gave the tailor a small, heavy pouch and rolled away down the street like a barrel.
The tailor opened the pouch, but found not gold or silver, but twelve smooth, grey stones, each no bigger than his thumb. He felt disappointment bite him, and thinking himself cheated, he tossed one grey stone onto the refuse heap behind his cottage. Next morning, however, he saw that the stone on the refuse heap had sprouted roots and grown into a tiny, perfect tree made of pure silver. The tailor gasped, ran quickly to gather up the other eleven stones, and stored them carefully in his empty thread box. That evening, he took another stone and planted it carefully in a clean pot with good earth from the woods nearby. By morning, another tree stood there, this one of shining copper, and hung with tiny golden needles. The tailor saw it was different from the silver one and understood the stones were not all the same in their magic. He carefully plucked a golden needle from the copper tree, threaded it with his common thread, and began to sew a waistcoat for the mayor. The golden needle flew through the cloth faster than his eye could follow, making the most perfect stitches imaginable, and all the while it sang tiny, cheerful sewing songs. The waistcoat was finished in no time, the finest ever seen in the village, and soon the tailor had plenty of work and was poor no longer.
But as his fame for marvellous sewing grew, people in the village began to wonder at the speed and perfection of his work. Especially the old tailor across the street, who had always had the most custom, grew envious and began to watch the now-prosperous tailor's house by night. One night, peering through a crack in the shutters, the old tailor saw a faint light within, like a silver and copper glow. The old tailor resolved to find the secret of this light and planned to creep in when the prosperous tailor went to the market. Soon the day came when the prosperous tailor went to market to buy fine silk, and in his haste, he forgot to latch the back window. The old tailor, who had been watching, crept around the back, saw the unlatched window, climbed through, and tiptoed inside, peering into pots and lifting cloths. At last, in the tailor's bedroom, he found the thread box slightly open and saw within it the tiny silver and copper trees, glowing faintly. Greed filled the old tailor's heart, and he determined to steal these wondrous trees and any stones he could find. But as he reached into the box, the tiny trees leaped out and stuck fast, one to the end of his long nose and the other to his left ear. He pulled and tugged, but they would not come off, and, beginning to whimper, he tried to flee the house, bumping into furniture with the trees waving from his face.
Just then, the prosperous tailor came home from the market, his arms laden with fine silk. He saw the old tailor stumbling about with the silver tree on his nose and the copper tree on his ear, and asked, 'Neighbour, what is this?' The old tailor stammered, 'I... I was just admiring your... uh... your novel head decorations, neighbour.' The prosperous tailor understood at once, touched the base of each tiny tree, spoke the word 'Release', and they fell off the old tailor's face. The old tailor mumbled apologies, his face red as beetroot, gathered his dignity like dropped stitches, and scuttled away home. The prosperous tailor looked at the little trees, then at the nine stones still in his thread box, and knew he must find a safer place for them. He found an old iron pot with a heavy lid, placed the remaining nine stones and the two little trees inside, and hid the pot beneath the hearthstone. He continued to sew and prosper, using the golden needle, though after some months the needle seemed less bright, and its sewing songs grew fainter. His stitches were still good, but not quite so perfect, and the tailor thought perhaps the golden needle was weary and he should plant another stone. He lifted the heavy hearthstone, took out the iron pot, opened the lid, and saw the nine stones and two trees nestled inside; but amidst them, something else stirred.
A little man made entirely of tangled grey thread, with two mismatched buttons for eyes, hopped out of the pot onto the floor. 'Greetings, Stitcher!' said the thread man in a voice like rustling silk, 'I grew here out of the quiet, and now it is time for me to measure the world.' The tailor stared and asked, 'But how can you measure the world? You have no legs to walk, and you carry no measuring tape.' The thread man laughed, a sound like snips in the air, and began to unravel himself, a single long grey thread stretching out from his feet across the room. The thread snaked out the door, down the street, measured the height of the mayor's house, the width of the baker's oven, and the lean of the church steeple. Then the thread zipped back in a flash, wound itself back into the little man, who declared, 'Just as I thought, the world is quite lopsided and needs adjustment!' 'And you, Stitcher,' he announced, pointing a thread finger, 'must help me adjust it! You shall sew a tuck in the eastern sky to make the sunrise straight!' The tailor sighed a weary sigh that stirred the thread man's head and said, 'That is even harder than sewing buttons on the wind! How can I reach the sky?' 'Easy!' chirped the thread man, 'I shall unravel again, all the way up! You shall climb the thread!' So the tailor, seeing no way out of it, agreed to try, and found his stoutest thimble to wear on his finger for the climb.
The thread man stood in the tailor's yard and began to unravel upwards, the silver-grey thread rising higher and higher until it looked thinner than a spider's silk against the blue. The tailor put his thimble on his finger, took a deep breath, grasped the thread, and began to climb, finding the thread swayed mightily and was hard to hold. He climbed for a long time, passing the village rooftops, then the church steeple, and then even the puffy white clouds drifted below him. At last, his arms aching, he reached the top of the thread and found the sky was very like a vast blue cloth stretched taut above the world. He looked eastward and saw a place where the blue cloth sagged a little, letting the morning sunlight come through crookedly, just as the thread man had said. He took out a sturdy needle he had brought, and using the very end of the thread man's long thread he had climbed, he prepared to sew a tuck. He pushed the needle into the blue cloth, which felt tougher than old leather, and managed, with much effort, to make one small stitch. As he pulled the thread tight, he thought he heard a distant, mighty 'Ouch!' from the direction of the sun. Startled, the tailor decided one stitch was quite enough adjustment for one day and prepared to climb down the long thread. He looked down and saw, to his alarm, that the thread man below had already begun winding the thread back up, shouting 'Tidying up! Tidying up!'
The tailor grasped the thread and slid down as fast as he could, faster and faster as the thread zipped upwards, making his hands grow hot. He landed in a heap in his own yard just as the last bit of thread zipped into the little thread man, who stood looking quite pleased with himself. 'There!' the thread man declared proudly. 'Slightly better, I think, though perhaps still a bit wobbly on Tuesdays.' The tailor, deciding he had had quite enough adventure for a lifetime, carefully picked up the little thread man and placed him back in the iron pot with the stones. He put the heavy lid on tight, and this time he buried the pot even deeper beneath his hearthstone than before. After that, the tailor lived quietly and worked diligently, and the sunrise did seem perhaps a little straighter most mornings, except, sometimes, on Tuesdays. His first golden needle eventually faded until it looked like any other needle, and he used plain steel ones thereafter. And the envious old tailor across the street complained forever after that his nose and left ear sometimes itched fiercely for no reason at all. Sometimes, when the fire burned low, the prosperous tailor wondered about the pot beneath the hearth, but he always left it buried. And so he lived, content enough and stitching neatly, to the end of his days.
