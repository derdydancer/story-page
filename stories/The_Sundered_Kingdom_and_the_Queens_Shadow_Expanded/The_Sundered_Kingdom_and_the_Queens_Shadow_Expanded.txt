The Sundered Kingdom and the Queen's Shadow (Expanded)
Once upon a time, in a kingdom blessed with sunshine, there dwelt a King.
He had a beautiful Queen, and they lived together in the royal palace.
They also had two sons, the thoughtful older Prince and the quiet younger Prince.
The kingdom flourished under his hand, bathed in a gentle light from the sky.
Life seemed peaceful for all who lived within its borders, and laughter was often heard.
Yet, though the Queen was fair and kind, a shadow lay upon her heart that none could see.
The King, who loved his Queen, sometimes saw a change in her eyes, a dimming of their usual light.
When he asked if aught was amiss, she would smile and say, "It is nothing, my lord, merely a passing cloud."
Her two sons also sensed a quietness in their mother at times, but they did not understand its source.
So the shadow remained within the Queen, unseen by most, a small thing then, but it was there.
As days turned into weeks, the Queen tried to laugh and speak as she once had done.
But she walked alone more often in the palace gardens, and her smiles did not always reach her eyes.
The King watched her from afar sometimes, and a growing weight settled upon his own spirit.
One evening, he took her hand and asked gently, "My Queen, what truly troubles you? Prithee, lift the veil from your heart."
She looked away from his earnest gaze and replied, "It is only a deep weariness, my King, that a night's rest does not seem to cure."
The King nodded slowly, though his heart felt no lighter for her words.
In the royal court, too, lords and ladies began to notice the Queen's quiet demeanor and infrequent laughter.
Her sons often brought her flowers from the garden or simply sat near her, watching her with solemn eyes.
She would thank them with a gentle smile, but the sadness lingered in the lines around her mouth.
So the unseen burden in the Queen's heart did not lessen but seemed to deepen its hold with each passing moon.
When the next season arrived, and the Queen's pallor had not improved, the King summoned the wisest physicians in the land.
They came to the palace and felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and asked her many questions about her humours.
The Queen answered them quietly, but she spoke little of the shadow that truly weighed upon her.
So the physicians consulted amongst themselves for many hours, but they could find no cause for her lingering sadness, nor any certain cure.
They went to the King at last and said, "Your Majesty, we find no bodily ill that our arts can touch; her malady seems to lie deeper."
The King heard their words and dismissed them with a heavy sigh, his brow furrowed with greater worry than before.
After the physicians departed, the Queen spoke even less, and often she would sit by the window, gazing out at the distant horizon.
A quiet gloom began to settle over the sunlit halls of the palace, and music was played less often.
The two Princes watched their mother with troubled hearts, for they loved her dearly but knew not the cause of her persistent sadness.
So the Queen remained alone with her shadow, and the King felt a growing fear that no earthly remedy could reach her.
One day, while the Queen sat listlessly in her chambers, an old serving woman approached her with a hesitant air.
The old woman curtsied low and said, "Your Majesty, forgive my boldness, but I have heard whispers of a powerful magic across the great sea, a magic that might lift such shadows from the heart."
The Queen looked up, and for the first time in many months, a flicker of light entered her eyes.
"Tell me more of this magic," she commanded softly, her voice still weak but now holding a thread of urgency.
The old woman spoke of a desolate shore where a black tower stood, and within it dwelt a solitary Sorcerer of great but hidden power.
"It is said this Sorcerer can mend hearts that are broken or lay spirits to rest that are troubled by unseen woes," the old woman continued.
The Queen listened to every word, and then she fell silent for a long time, her gaze fixed on that distant hope.
At last, she looked at the old woman and said, "If such a chance exists, no matter how remote, I must seek this Sorcerer."
The old serving woman bowed her head and whispered, "May your journey bring you the peace you seek, Your Majesty."
So, with a newfound resolve stirring in her weary heart, the Queen determined to speak to the King that very day about her desperate hope.
Later that evening, the Queen sought out the King, and she found him in his study, reading by candlelight.
The King looked up and saw that though she was still pale, there was an unwonted light in her eyes.
"My Queen," he said, setting aside his book, "you have something you wish to tell me."
The Queen came closer and said, "My lord, you know the strange shadow that chills my spirit and steals my joy."
"Today I learned of a possible remedy, a difficult path perhaps, but one I feel I must take. Prithee, grant me leave to journey across the sea, to seek a cure that may set my spirit free."
The King's heart was heavy to hear this, for he loved his Queen dearly and the thought of her departure pained him.
He looked at her earnest face and asked, "Across the sea? That is a long and perilous voyage. What is this cure you speak of?"
The Queen then told him of the old woman's tale, of the desolate shore, the black tower, and the Sorcerer who dwelt there, mending troubled spirits.
"I know it is far, my lord," she said, her voice trembling slightly, "but this shadow consumes me day by day. If there is any chance, I must take it."
The King looked at her for a long moment, his expression deeply troubled, and then he said he must consider such a grave matter.
All that night, the King paced the floors of his chambers, and he did not sleep.
He thought of his love for the Queen and her deep unhappiness, and then he thought of the dangers of the sea and unknown Sorcerers.
He considered their two young sons and how they would fare without their mother's presence for a long time.
The next morning, he watched the Queen as she moved through the palace, her eyes hollow save for that faint hope she now carried.
He remembered the words of the royal physicians, how they could find no earthly cause for her ailment.
Perhaps, he thought, this strange journey was indeed her only chance to find peace from the shadow that haunted her.
And because he loved her greatly, the thought of her continued suffering was more than he could bear.
He spoke then to his oldest and most trusted counsellor, who listened gravely and advised caution but acknowledged the Queen's visible pain.
By the afternoon, after much troubled thought and seeing the Queen's unwavering, desperate hope, the King's mind was set.
So, with a heavy heart but a clear resolve, he knew he must grant her wish for her sake, though it would bring him great sorrow.
That same evening, the King sent word for the Queen to attend him in the grand council chamber.
She came to him there, pale but composed, her eyes questioning and filled with a fragile hope.
The King looked upon her gently and said, "My Queen, I have considered your words and the great unhappiness that burdens you."
"Though it grieves me to part from you, and though my heart is filled with unease for such a journey, I grant your wish to seek this cure across the sea."
A small gasp escaped the Queen, and tears welled in her eyes, tears of relief and profound gratitude.
"Oh, my lord, my King," she whispered, sinking into a curtsy, "you have given me the greatest gift, the gift of hope."
The King raised her gently and said, "You shall have my finest ship, a loyal captain, and whatever companions you deem necessary for your comfort and safety."
A spark of her old vitality seemed to return to the Queen then, and she spoke of needing only a few trusted attendants and a swift departure.
Word soon spread through the palace that the Queen was to undertake a long sea voyage to seek a cure for her lingering illness.
So preparations began at once, yet a heavy air of anticipation and unspoken sorrow settled upon the royal household.
The sun rose on a grey morning a few days later, the appointed time for the Queen's ship to sail.
The Queen emerged from her chambers dressed in plain travelling clothes, her face pale but resolute.
Her two sons stood waiting for her, their young faces etched with worry, and she embraced each of them tightly.
"Be brave, my sons," she whispered, "and pray for my journey, that I may return to you well and whole."
Then she turned to the King, who stood watching with a heavy heart, and they looked at each other for a long moment without words.
The King took her hand and said softly, "Go with my blessing, Anna. May you find the peace you seek, and return swiftly to us."
With a final nod, the Queen turned and walked towards the waiting ship, her attendants following somberly behind her.
The King and his two sons stood upon the shore and watched as the ship's sails caught the wind and carried her away across the grey waters.
They watched until the ship was but a speck on the horizon, and then they turned back towards the palace with troubled hearts.
And so, Queen Anna departed from the kingdom, leaving behind her husband and sons, and a shadow of uncertainty fell upon the once bright land.
The Queen's ship sailed upon the wide ocean for many days and nights, and the winds were often fickle.
Sometimes great waves crashed over the deck, and sometimes dark storms obscured the sun and stars.
The Queen mostly stayed in her small cabin or sat wrapped in a cloak on the deck, her gaze often fixed eastward.
When her attendants spoke to her of the kingdom left behind, she would only say, "I seek the lifting of this shadow; that is my sole thought now."
At long last, after what seemed an age of grey sea and sky, the ship's lookout cried that land was sighted ahead, a bleak and barren coastline.
As the ship drew nearer, they saw no signs of habitation, only dark rocks and, standing starkly against the pale sky, a single tall and black tower.
The Queen looked towards the tower with an unwavering gaze and then ordered a small boat to be lowered.
Her loyal captain offered to accompany her, but she shook her head and said, "This is a path I must walk alone."
So she was rowed to the desolate shore, and she stepped out onto the black, volcanic sand, the only sound the waves and the distant cry of a lone seabird.
Then the Queen turned and walked steadily across the barren land towards the dark, silent tower that held her only hope for peace.
The black tower had no windows visible from the ground, only a single, large door made of heavy, dark wood.
The Queen paused before it for a moment, then raised her hand to knock, but before her knuckles touched the wood, the door swung inward silently.
She stepped inside into a vast, dimly lit circular hall, where the air was cold and still, and in the center sat a tall figure upon a single, unadorned chair.
The figure was a Sorcerer, cloaked in long dark robes, his face shadowed by a deep hood, but his eyes were visible, and they were cold and keen.
The Sorcerer did not rise but watched her approach, and then he spoke, his voice low and resonant, "I know why you have come, Queen from the sunlit lands."
The Queen stopped a respectful distance away and replied, "Great Sorcerer, I have journeyed far to seek your aid, to overcome the shadow on my heart."
The Sorcerer inclined his hooded head slightly and said, "The shadow can be lifted, yes. But all magic has a price, Queen. That is the first law."
The Queen, her voice tight with longing for relief, answered quickly, "If you can end this torment, ask for anything. I will give my all if this crushing weight will fall from my soul!"
The Sorcerer replied, his voice devoid of emotion, "I ask not for gold or gems, for those I have in abundance. But the next time you cherish a thing of beauty, save for your own kin, a sliver of its joy shall be my fee."
"Agree to this, Queen, and find your spirit's ease. Refuse, and return to your shadowed lands as you came."
Queen Anna repeated his words thoughtfully, "A sliver of its joy, you say, from things of beauty I cherish, but not my kin?"
The Sorcerer nodded once, his cold eyes fixed on her. "That is my fee, clearly stated. A small share in your delight, nothing more."
The Queen considered this for another moment and thought, "My sons, my husband, they are my greatest treasures, and they are safe from this. What are gems or art compared to a lightened heart?"
Then she looked directly at the Sorcerer and declared, "That seems a small price indeed for the peace I crave. I agree! Your terms I shall fulfill!"
A flicker that might have been satisfaction, or perhaps something else, crossed the Sorcerer's shadowed face for an instant, then he said, "So be it. The bargain is struck."
Then the Sorcerer lifted one long-fingered hand, and a faint, cold mist seemed to gather around it before he gestured towards the Queen.
A perceptible chill touched the Queen's brow for a fleeting moment, and at once, she felt a great weight lift from her spirit, a wave of peace washing through her.
The lines of sorrow around her mouth seemed to smooth away, and her eyes regained their former light and clarity.
She drew a deep breath, the first truly easy breath in years, and then she turned with a lighter step to depart from the tower.
But unseen by her as she left, a thin thread of shadow unspooled from her very being, tethering her back to the tower, and the Sorcerer watched her go and thought, "The magic is spun. What joy she touches now, will be undone."
The journey back across the wide ocean was swift and untroubled, with fair winds and calm seas guiding the Queen's ship homeward.
She smiled often, and spoke with her attendants of the beauty of the sunsets over the water, and of her eagerness to see her family.
Word had been sent ahead by a swift messenger bird that the Queen was returning, and that she seemed much improved in spirit.
So the King and his two sons, along with the entire court, made preparations for her welcome, their hearts filled with a cautious hope.
Then one bright morning, a cry went up from the watchtowers; the Queen's ship was sighted on the horizon, its sails full and white.
When the Queen stepped ashore, she looked radiant indeed, no longer pale and burdened, but with a light in her eyes that gladdened all who saw her.
King Peter rejoiced to see her vibrant self apparently restored, and he strode forward quickly to greet her with open arms.
Her two sons ran to her side, their faces bright with happiness, and she embraced them warmly, her laughter echoing for the first time in many years.
Just then, as the royal family was reunited on the quay, a courtier brought forth a magnificent new crown adorned with flawless gems, a gift to the Queen signifying unity and joy.
"Behold this treasure, my love," said the King, his voice warm with happiness, placing the glittering crown in Anna's hands.
Queen Anna gazed upon the crown, truly loving its intricate beauty and the sparkle of its gems, and she cried, "Oh, wondrous craftsmanship! It fills my soul with delight!"
At that very instant, as her words of delight were spoken, the crown's gems visibly dimmed, and their brilliant sparkle seemed to dull before their eyes.
A look of fear dawned on Anna's face, and she whispered, "The light... what has happened to the light?"
King Peter frowned with a flicker of unease, though most of the court, caught up in the joy of her return, noticed little of the subtle change.
"It is as if a breath of joy was stolen from it!" the Queen murmured, looking from the dulled crown to the King's face.
"It is splendid, love," said the King, forcing a smile, though his unease remained. "Perhaps just a trick of the light, or a passing cloud."
The court then proceeded with the planned celebrations for the Queen's return, and there was music and feasting, but the Queen held the dulled crown with a troubled expression.
Later, in her chambers, the Queen took out a beloved silver locket, a gift from her childhood, and gazed upon its delicate engraving with affection.
As she felt a wave of fondness for the locket, its polished surface seemed to cloud over slightly, losing a fraction of its sheen.
So from that day forward, a shadow began to creep over the kingdom, born from the Queen's secret bargain, and the vibrant hues of joy everywhere started to subtly fade.
Many seasons passed, and the kingdom's bright colours continued to fade slowly, like a beautiful tapestry left too long in the sun.
Queen Anna seldom touched or openly admired anything of beauty now, fearing to see its light diminish further, and she walked as if in a perpetual shade.
The King grew older and more troubled, for he saw the Queen's distant manner and the pervasive dimness that had settled upon his once-bright land.
One evening, he gently asked her, "Anna, my love, the light we once knew seems so diminished in you, and in our halls. What new shadow is this?"
The Queen looked away, a flicker of her old fear in her eyes, and replied, "It is nothing, my lord, perhaps just the passing of years that dims all things."
But the King felt something was deeply wrong beyond the mere passage of time, and he knew in his heart this was not the whole truth.
Meanwhile, as the gloom deepened, the elder Prince, now a young man, found some distraction in the company of a travelling Bard with twinkling eyes and a colourful, patched cloak.
This Bard was a master of the lute and a singer of comical and wise songs, and he often spoke of the importance of mastering oneself before mastering any instrument.
The elder Prince enjoyed the lively tunes the Bard played but often found his talk of inner harmony and self-awareness somewhat tedious.
Then one night, as the King sat alone in his study, his mind heavy with the kingdom's sorrow, he remembered old tales of a forgotten Magic Mirror hidden somewhere in the castle attics that showed truths long past.
A new resolve formed in the King, and he decided that on the morrow he would search the dusty attics for this forgotten mirror.
That very night, as he lay in his bed, a small, grey bird flew in through his open window and perched on his bedpost.
Then the bird sang in a clear, sweet voice a short rhyme: "Seek the glass where shadows sleep, For hidden truth the echoes keep."
Then, as quickly as it had appeared, the bird flew away as silently as it came, leaving the King much amazed and more determined than ever.
The next day, the King, giving some excuse to his court, went alone to the dusty, cobweb-filled attics of the oldest part of the castle.
He searched for many hours among old furniture, discarded tapestries, and chests filled with relics of generations past.
At last, in a far corner, hidden behind a stack of disused shields, he found a tall, narrow object entirely covered in a heavy, dark velvet cloth.
With a sense of strange anticipation, the King pulled the cloth away, and revealed not shining glass, but a surface as dark and unreflective as a midnight pool.
He touched its cold frame and commanded, "Mirror, if you are the glass of old tales, show me the cause of the sorrow we keep!" but the dark surface remained unchanged.
Disappointed, the King covered the strange glass again and left the attic, wondering if the tales were merely fables or if he lacked the true key to its power.
That night again, as the King pondered the mirror's silence, the same small, grey bird flew in through his window and perched once more on his bedpost.
It tilted its head and sang its sweet, clear song: "Not command, but heart's true plea, Unlocks the sights for eyes to see."
Then, with a flutter of its wings, the bird was gone, leaving the King to contemplate its new words.
The King thought long on this, understanding that perhaps his first approach to the mirror had been too stern, too commanding.
For the third night, as the King lay waiting with a mix of hope and doubt, the little grey bird returned as before.
This time its song was brief and clear: "Ask of the Queen, and her far shore, And what was priced at bargain's core."
And with that, the bird flew out into the darkness and was seen no more by the King.
A heavy certainty settled upon the King then, for the rhymes now seemed to form a clear instruction.
He looked out his window at a rosebush in the moonlight, noticing how its perfect blooms grew alongside sharp thorns, and how both were part of its nature.
So, the following dawn, with the bird's rhymes echoing in his mind and the image of the rosebush still fresh, the King went once more to the silent attics.
He found the tall, narrow glass still hidden in the corner and, with a slow breath, pulled away the velvet cloth once more.
This time, he did not command, but spoke quietly to the dark, still surface, "Mirror, I ask not with command but with a heart heavy with sorrow. Show me what befell my Queen on her journey to the far shore; show me the bargain that was struck for her heart's ease."
As he finished speaking, the dark surface of the mirror began to shimmer, and then pale mists swirled within its depths.
Slowly, the mists parted, and an image formed, as clear and undeniable as if he were truly there: he saw the desolate shore and the black tower.
Then he saw his Queen Anna, looking weary but resolute, stepping before the tall Sorcerer with the cold eyes.
The King watched in horrified silence as the mirror showed their conversation, and he heard the Sorcerer's demand: "the next time you cherish a thing of beauty, save for your own kin, a sliver of its joy shall be my fee."
He saw Queen Anna's brief hesitation, then her quick, eager agreement, her voice clear in the vision, "That seems a small price. I agree! Your terms I shall fulfill!"
Then the mirror showed the Sorcerer lifting his hand, the chill touching the Queen's brow, and the sudden wave of peace that smoothed her features as her eyes regained their former light.
And then, a detail the Queen herself had not seen, the mirror showed the thin thread of shadow unspooling from her, tethering her back to the Sorcerer's tower.
Finally, the vision shifted to the Queen's return, to her holding the gifted crown, and the King watched again in horror as its light visibly dimmed the moment she cherished its beauty and spoke her delight.
The images in the mirror faded back into mist, and King Peter staggered back from the glass, his face pale as ash.
He leaned against a dusty chest for support and whispered to the silent attic, "Anna... my Queen... for your own ease... you betrayed the joy of the entire kingdom?"
A great weight of sorrow settled upon him then, a sorrow far deeper than before, for it felt as if all the trust and love he held had been shattered.
A cold wave of anger passed through him, followed by a faint, painful understanding of the torment she must have endured to make such a choice.
Yet, though filled with this new and terrible grief, a different kind of resolve began to form in him as he stood there in the dust and shadows.
He looked at the dark mirror once more and decided, for the sake of the kingdom, and perhaps from a lingering, wounded pity for the Queen, this truth must remain hidden from all others.
Then he carefully draped the heavy velvet cloth back over the unblinking eye of the mirror, shrouding its terrible knowledge once more.
He would decree, he determined, that the Queen's old illness had merely taken a deeper, more troubling turn, affecting her mind.
And for her own troubled state, and to prevent further accidental harm to the kingdom's fading joys through her unknowing touch, she must be confined to distant chambers.
So, with a heavy heart and the weight of this secret pressing down on him, the King left the attics, a changed man.
The next day, the King made a solemn decree to his court and to his sons, his voice heavy with feigned sorrow.
He announced that the Queen's spirit, once so bright, had succumbed further to the shadows that had long plagued her, and that her mind was now deeply troubled and confused.
"For her own rest and quiet," the King declared, "and to shield her from the demands that might worsen her fragile state, she must be moved to the peaceful, distant chambers in the west wing."
A hush of sorrow fell upon the court, and the two Princes listened with pale faces and deep distress, for they loved their mother dearly.
The Queen herself, when informed by the King in private of this decision, received the news with a strange quietness, her shadowed eyes revealing little.
So it was done, and the Queen was gently escorted to comfortable but remote chambers in the quietest wing of the palace, with only a few trusted attendants to see to her needs.
The great halls of the palace seemed emptier thereafter, and laughter became an even scarcer sound than before.
The two Princes were allowed to visit their mother on certain days, but her manner was often distant, and their hearts ached for the warmth they remembered.
The kingdom mourned what they believed was a beautiful Queen lost to a troubled mind, and prayers were offered for her recovery, though few now expected it.
And the King ruled on, with a heavy heart but a composed facade, carrying the secret of the mirror's revelation alone.
Years passed, and the shadow over the kingdom did not lift; indeed, the very colours of the world seemed muted, and joy was a rare visitor.
Queen Anna, seldom seen by anyone but her attendants and occasionally her sons, grew frailer and more silent in her distant chambers.
The thoughtful older Prince and the quiet younger Prince grew to young men in this time of gloom, their childhood memories of a sunlit kingdom fading.
The elder Prince still sought out the old Bard from time to time, who now had a permanent, if humble, place at court, but the Prince still preferred the Bard's swift melodies to his slow lessons of the heart.
During these long years, a vast Dark Forest of Thorns began to grow along one border of the kingdom, slowly encroaching and dividing the land.
All who lived in the sundered land felt the weight of the shadow in some way; even the trees seemed to sigh, and true joy was scarce.
King Peter continued to rule with a heavy heart, watching his sons grow, and seeing the light of his kingdom remain stubbornly dim.
No one in the kingdom, save the King, truly understood the cause of this enduring sorrow, and perhaps some of the shadow's power lay in its hidden cause.
Sometimes, in the deep of night, the King would look towards the Queen's silent wing of the palace and wonder if there had ever been another path, another way to face the shadow she had carried.
And so the long, weary years unfolded one after another, and the sundered kingdom waited without knowing for what it waited.
After the King had left the attics with his terrible secret, he summoned his chief court physician the very next morning.
"You will speak to any who inquire," the King instructed, his voice low and firm, "that the Queen's malady has deepened into a profound melancholy of the mind, beyond any known cure but rest."
The elderly physician looked into the King's haunted eyes, then bowed his head and replied, "As you command, Your Majesty. Her condition is indeed most grave."
Then the King ordered that the Queen be moved from her west wing chambers to a small, secluded tower at the furthest edge of the palace grounds, its few windows looking only upon the growing Dark Forest.
He also decreed that his sons could henceforth visit their mother only once each season, and always in his presence for a short while.
When the Princes next visited her in the secluded tower, under the King's watchful eye, their mother barely spoke, and for most of the hour she would only look out the window at the encroaching thorns.
And all the while, the Dark Forest of Thorns on the kingdom's border grew denser and its thorns sharper, casting an ever-deeper shadow over the surrounding lands.
After more years had passed in this manner, and the King felt the chill of his own advancing age and the court's persistent gloom, he resolved to seek a new wife.
He sought and found a gentle lady from a neighboring, peaceful land, a widow with a young son and daughter of her own, and he married her, making her his new Queen.
This new Queen tried her best to bring some measure of grace and gentleness to the sorrowful palace, and the King was grateful for her quiet presence and her kindness to his sons.
One day, some months after her arrival, the new Queen suggested to the King, "My lord, the Royal Preserve of ancient trees to the north of the palace seems little used but for the occasional royal hunt. Perhaps it might be best to let it remain entirely undisturbed, a quiet haven for wildlife."
The King, weary from years of sorrow and trusting her gentle judgement in such matters, considered this and then agreed.
"So be it," he said. "Let it be proclaimed that none shall enter the Royal Preserve henceforth, that it may be a place of peace."
The elder Prince, who had never shown much interest in hunting unlike his younger brother, overheard this decree and wondered greatly about this suddenly forbidden Preserve.
And unseen by him or anyone else, from a high window in her secluded tower, his mother, the old Queen Anna, watched the elder Prince's thoughtful expression and a plan began to form in her mind.
Soon after the decree concerning the Royal Preserve, the old Queen Anna sent a message through a trusted, silent attendant, summoning her elder son to her tower chamber.
The elder Prince went as bidden, his heart heavy for his mother's long confinement, and found her sitting by the narrow window of her bleak stone chamber.
"My son," she said, her voice frail but with an undercurrent of intensity, "you are a young man now, and you see the shadows in this house. Things are not as they seem."
"Your father," she whispered, leaning closer as if sharing a dangerous secret, "is weakened by years and sorrow, and the new Queen, with her own ambitions, holds sway over his counsel now."
"But," she continued, her eyes gleaming faintly in the dim light, "in the Royal Preserve, now so strangely forbidden at her suggestion, lies a secret that could perhaps restore me and reveal the truth behind this long gloom."
The elder Prince, who loved his mother and wished deeply to ease the kingdom's sorrow and her own, listened to her whispered words and believed them.
"Mother," he vowed, his young face earnest, "if the secret to your restoration and the kingdom's light lies in the Preserve, then I shall seek it out, no matter the decree!"
A hidden smile touched the old Queen Anna's lips as her elder son left her chamber, his mind set on his dangerous new purpose.
But the younger Prince, who had been passing his mother's tower on his way from the training grounds, had paused outside her door and overheard his brother's fervent vow and his mother's soft, encouraging words.
The younger Prince said nothing then, but he watched his elder brother stride away with a troubled heart, for the old Queen's voice had sounded strangely unlike her usual distant self.
That very night, when the moon was hidden by clouds, the elder Prince dressed in dark, simple clothes and took a small hunting knife, not for game, but for whatever obstacles he might face.
He slipped out of the palace unnoticed and made his way to the northern boundary, where he found a place in the ancient, overgrown wall of the Royal Preserve that he could climb.
Once inside, the air was cool and still, and the smell of damp earth and old leaves was strong; it was far wilder and more ancient than he had ever imagined.
He pushed deeper into the woods, his eyes searching the moonlit shadows for any sign of a path or a hidden place his mother might have meant.
Then, as he came to a small, moon-dappled glade with a mossy rock at its center, a tall figure stepped out from behind a great oak tree, clad in rough furs and leaves, with long, matted hair and eyes like ancient stones.
The Wild Man regarded the elder Prince silently for a moment, then spoke in a voice like the rustling of leaves and the cracking of branches, "This is a forbidden place, young one of the palace. What do you seek here where men do not tread?"
The elder Prince, startled but resolute, answered, "I seek a hidden secret, a truth that might restore my mother, the Queen, and lift the shadow from our land."
The Wild Man listened, his stone-like eyes unblinking, then he said, "Truths are not found easily, and restoration is a difficult magic. If your heart is true to this place and its spirit, then you must first prove your worth through three tasks I shall set you within this forest."
"I will undertake any task," the elder Prince replied, his voice steady, "if it leads to the end of this sorrow."
The Wild Man nodded slowly. "Good. First, then, you must find the oldest tree in this Preserve, a tree whose heart is hollowed by time but still gives shelter to the smallest creatures of the wood. You must spend a night within its hollow and listen to what it whispers."
The elder Prince set off at once, deeper into the dark and tangled woods, searching for such a tree as the Wild Man described.
After much walking, as dawn approached, he found it: an immense and gnarled oak, its bark like wrinkled skin, with a large, dark hollow at its base from which came the faint sounds of stirring life.
He cautiously approached and, seeing tiny birds flit in and out and a family of squirrels peeking from above, he crawled into the surprisingly dry and sheltered hollow.
All that day he stayed within the tree, and as dusk fell, he listened intently not to words, but to the rustling leaves, the sighing wind through branches, the tiny sounds of creatures, and it seemed like the very heartbeat of the forest itself.
When the next morning came, he crawled out, quieter and more thoughtful, and made his way back to the glade where the Wild Man awaited him by the mossy rock.
"I found the ancient tree," the elder Prince told the Wild Man, "and I listened. It did not speak in words of secrets, but its whole being spoke of endurance, and shelter, and the slow turning of time."
The Wild Man gave a single, slow nod. "You have listened well. For your second task, you must find the stream in this Preserve that appears to flow uphill against the lay of the land. You must follow it, no matter how deceiving its path, until you discover its true source."
The elder Prince went forth again, this time searching for a stream that defied the natural order, a task that seemed impossible.
He walked for many hours, following several ordinary streams, until in a rocky defile he found one that, through a trick of the eye and cunningly shaped rocks and channels, did indeed appear to climb the slope before him.
He began to follow its meandering and confusing path, often losing it in tangled undergrowth or over slippery stones, but always finding it again.
At last, high up in a hidden cleft of rock, concealed by ferns, he found its true source: a small, hidden spring that gushed from the hillside, its waters cleverly channeled by nature and time to create the illusion below.
He sat by the true spring for a long time, and he understood then that what appears to be may not be the truth, and that true sources are often hidden from casual view, requiring effort to uncover.
Then he returned to the Wild Man in the glade, who again waited patiently.
"You have seen beyond illusion," the Wild Man said. "For your third and final task, you must find the part of this forest most deeply wounded by the growing shadow from the kingdom beyond. There, you must bring a single seed from the healthiest fruit tree you can find within these woods, plant it in that wounded place, and tend it faithfully until it sprouts, no matter how barren the soil may seem."
This was the hardest task of all, for the shadow's touch was subtle but widespread, so the elder Prince searched for many days before he found a barren, blighted patch near the edge of the Dark Forest of Thorns itself.
The ground there was cracked and dry, the few stunted trees were leafless, and the earth smelled sour and unwelcoming.
He then searched the less afflicted parts of the Preserve and, after much looking, found a single, healthy apple tree bearing a few late fruits, and he carefully took one perfect seed from its core.
Returning to the blighted patch, he used his small knife to make a shallow hollow in the hard earth, placed the seed within, and covered it gently.
Then, for many days, he faithfully tended that spot, bringing water in cupped hands from a distant, cleaner stream, and shielding the place from harsh winds with stones.
He saw no change for a long time, and the soil remained barren, but he did not give up, and then one morning, he saw a tiny green shoot pushing resolutely up through the cracked earth.
A quiet joy, deeper than any he had known from swift melodies or fleeting victories, filled the elder Prince's breast as he looked upon it.
He tended the sprout for a few more days until it seemed strong, then he went back to the glade to find the Wild Man.
The Wild Man looked at him, and it seemed to the Prince that the stone-like eyes held a flicker of warmth. "You have done well, Prince of the shadowed court," he said. "You have learned to listen, to see beyond illusion, and to nurture life in the face of despair."
"The truth you sought to restore your mother often lies not in grand secrets hidden in deep forests," the Wild Man continued, "but sometimes sleeps in forgotten corners of your own house, reflecting what is hidden in hearts, if one knows how to ask."
Then the Wild Man of the Preserve turned and stepped back towards the great oak from which he had first emerged, and as he reached it, he seemed to merge with its ancient bark and was gone from the Prince's sight.
The elder Prince stood alone in the glade, and he pondered all he had seen and done in the Royal Preserve, and the Wild Man's final, enigmatic words.
Then, as he thought of 'forgotten corners' and 'reflecting what is hidden in hearts,' he remembered a half-forgotten tale from his childhood, something an old nurse had once whispered about a truth-telling Mirror hidden away in the castle attics.
A different kind of resolve, quieter but stronger than his vow to his mother, settled upon him then, and he knew he must search for this Mirror.
So he left the ancient woods of the Royal Preserve, no longer a boy driven by a shadowed plea, but a changed young man seeking a clearer sight.
He returned to the palace and, waiting for the dead of night, he began to search the highest, dustiest, and most forgotten attics, just as his father had done years before, though the Prince knew nothing of that.
At last, behind a heavy, moth-eaten tapestry depicting a long-forgotten battle, he found it: a tall glass covered in dusty, dark velvet, leaning against the cold stone wall.
With a hand that trembled only slightly, for he felt a strange preparedness now, he pulled the cloth away and looked upon a strange, mist-filled glass that reflected nothing of the candle he held.
He remembered the Wild Man's words about asking, and his father's earlier failed command, and spoke to the strange glass in a quiet but firm voice, "Mirror of Truth, if that is what you are, I ask you to reveal the story lost, the true cause of the sorrow in my house."
As he spoke these words from his heart, the mists within the Mirror began to swirl and deepen, and then slowly, images started to form.
It showed him his mother, Queen Anna, not as a helpless victim of a strange illness, but as she was years ago, standing before the cold-eyed Sorcerer in the black tower, making the bargain for her own heart's ease, costing the kingdom its joy.
The Mirror then showed her cherishing the gifted crown upon her return, and the elder Prince watched, his breath caught in his throat, as its brilliant gems visibly dimmed at her touch and words of delight.
The elder Prince recoiled from the Mirror as if struck, his heart suddenly cold with the chilling weight of this unwelcome truth.
"My mother's choice..." he thought, the words like ice in his mind. "Not for the kingdom's sake, as I believed, but for her own gain she struck that terrible bargain, and caused this endless pain!"
Then the Mirror swirled again and showed him another scene: his own father, years younger, standing before this very glass, his face etched with the same horror and heartbreak as he too learned the truth.
He watched as his father covered the Mirror and then, with a heavy heart, resolved to hide the truth and decree his mother's illness had deepened, leading to her confinement.
A wave of profound understanding and a different, sharper sorrow for his father washed over the elder Prince then, for he finally grasped the depth of the King's long, silent burden.
The images faded, and the elder Prince slowly covered the Mirror with its velvet cloth, his own face now a mask of troubled knowledge.
He left the dusty attic in the grey light of dawn, a changed man, just as his father had been before him, burdened by this terrible knowledge.
He did not return to his own chambers, but instead went straight to his father's private chambers, where the King was already awake and looking out at the dim sunrise.
The King turned and saw his elder son standing there, and he perceived at once the new weight in the young man's eyes, the same shadow of hidden knowledge that he himself had carried for so many years.
"Father," the elder Prince said, his voice quiet but heavy with all he now understood, "I have seen a truth today, a truth hidden for too long in the dust of the attics."
The King looked at his son, and a look of profound weariness, yet also a strange kind of resignation, settled on his face; he nodded slowly, understanding without being told more.
"I know now of the Sorcerer's tower," the Prince continued, his gaze steady on his father's, "of the price she paid for her ease, and how for that selfish choice, the kingdom was betrayed and our family fractured."
"It is true, my son. All of it," the King said, his voice barely above a whisper. "A truth I have carried alone these many years, a burden that has bent my very soul."
The elder Prince looked at his father's aged face and asked the question that now burned in him, "But why, Father? Why did you not tell us, your sons, the truth of our mother's actions?"
The King sighed heavily and walked to the window. "I hid it from shame for our house, my son," he said, "from a desire to shield you and your brother from a truth I thought too harsh for young hearts, and perhaps from a misguided pity for her, believing the knowledge would only deepen her supposed madness or your pain."
The elder Prince listened, and though a part of him still felt the sting of long deception, another, larger part, tempered by the lessons of the Preserve, understood the heavy choice his father had faced.
They stood in silence for many minutes then, father and son, the unspoken truth finally resting between them, easing one burden while perhaps creating new ones.
"And now that you know?" the King finally asked, turning back from the window. "What will you do with this knowledge that has poisoned our lives?"
The elder Prince looked at his father with his newfound clarity and said, "First, I must speak with my brother, and with the Queen Petra, for they too live under this shadow. Then, I believe, I must confront our mother, not with anger, but with the truth I now hold."
Later that same day, the elder Prince found his younger brother in the armory, practicing with his sword, his movements precise and focused.
"Brother," the elder Prince began, his voice somber, "I have come to speak with you of a grave matter, a truth about our mother and the true source of the kingdom's long sorrow."
The younger Prince stopped his practice at once, lowered his sword, and looked at his elder brother with concern, for he had never heard him speak with such heavy certainty.
So the elder Prince told him everything: of his visit to the Royal Preserve, the Wild Man's tasks, the Mirror in the attic, and the terrible bargain their mother had struck so many years ago.
The younger Prince listened without interruption, his face growing paler with each revealed detail, and when his brother had finished, he sat heavily on a wooden bench, the sword clattering from his loosened grip.
"So that was the truth behind her words to you about the Preserve..." the younger Prince murmured, more to himself than his brother. "That strange, fevered hope in her voice when she urged you towards it... she did not wish you to find a cure for her, but perhaps for you to be lost or to fail."
The elder Prince nodded sadly, and then he placed a hand on his younger brother's shoulder, and for a long moment they were united in a somber, shared understanding.
"Then we shall speak to Queen Petra together," the younger Prince said, his voice regaining some of its firmness. "She, too, deserves to know the true nature of the shadow that hangs over this house and her own children."
So the two Princes, now allies in this difficult knowledge, went to seek out Queen Petra, and they found her in the solar with her own young son and daughter, teaching them a simple song on a small harp.
Queen Petra looked up with a gentle smile as they entered, but her smile faded as she saw their solemn faces, and the elder Prince began, "Your Majesty, we have a difficult and sorrowful tale to unfold, one that touches us all deeply."
Queen Petra set aside her small harp and sent her two young children gently from the solar with a kind attendant, then turned back to the two Princes with a look of quiet inquiry.
Then the elder Prince, with his younger brother standing steadfastly by his side, recounted the tale of the Magic Mirror and the harsh sights it had revealed concerning their mother, Queen Anna, and the true origin of the kingdom's blight.
Queen Petra listened to the whole sorrowful account without a word, her face growing very still, and when they finished, she placed a hand over her heart for a moment.
The younger Prince then spoke, his voice low, of how their father had also learned this truth many years ago and had carried the solitary burden to protect them and the kingdom, as he saw fit.
"Now so much is made clear," Queen Petra said softly, her eyes filled with a deep compassion. "The King's enduring sadness, the Queen Anna's strange decline, the very air of this palace..."
She looked towards the door where her own children had departed and added, "And the shadow that even they, in their innocence, must feel, though they know not its name."
"This is a heavy truth indeed, my Princes," she said then, her voice gentle but firm. "But it is better known than hidden. I stand with you and with your father in whatever must come next."
The elder Prince nodded, grateful for her words, and said, "Then you should know, Your Majesty, that I intend to speak this truth to my mother in her tower."
Queen Petra considered this gravely. "Then speak it not in anger, which will only harden her resolve," she advised, "but speak it plainly, as a mirror reflects what is before it, for her own heart to see, if it will."
So a quiet understanding was reached among the King, who was soon informed of this council, his new Queen, and his two sons, a unity forged in the face of a long-hidden, painful truth.
The following afternoon, the elder Prince went alone to the secluded tower where his mother, Queen Anna, was confined.
He found her gazing out at the Dark Forest, and he stood before her and said quietly but clearly, "Mother, I know the truth of your journey across the sea, and of the bargain you made with the Sorcerer for your own ease."
Queen Anna turned from the window, her eyes wide for a moment, then narrowing, and she replied sharply, "What madness is this you speak, child? More lies whispered by the new Queen, no doubt!"
As she spoke these angry words of denial, a single, long, black thorn, like those from the Dark Forest, suddenly appeared on the stone floor between them, and it pulsed with a faint, dark light.
The Prince looked at the thorn, then back at his mother, his expression unchanged by her outburst. "The Mirror in the attic showed me the truth, Mother," he said. "Your bargain, your choice."
Queen Anna scoffed, though her eyes darted to the ominous thorn. "A rusty old glass in the attics? How dare you believe such a thing against your own mother! It is a trick, a deceit!"
"The truth has its own power, Mother, regardless of the vessel that reveals it," the Prince replied evenly. "The consequences of your choice are all around us."
He then bowed slightly and said, "I will leave you to consider my words and this dark token. I shall return on the morrow."
After he departed, Queen Anna stared at the black thorn on her floor as if it were an unwelcome guest that refused to leave.
The elder Prince walked back through the palace, his resolve firm, now understanding that helping his mother face her own shadowed heart was as vital as restoring the kingdom's light, for the two were deeply intertwined.
As promised, the next afternoon, the elder Prince returned to Queen Anna's tower chamber; the black thorn still lay upon the floor where it had appeared.
He greeted her respectfully and said once more, "Mother, I have returned to speak of the truth: of your bargain, and the shadow that fell upon the kingdom, and the joy that was stolen from us all because of it."
This time, Queen Anna did not rage, but her voice was soft and pleading. "My son, why do you torment me so with these cruel tales? Have I not suffered enough in this lonely tower, forgotten by the world?"
As she finished her plea of victimhood, the clear water in the small clay pitcher on her table suddenly turned cloudy and brackish before their eyes.
The Prince's expression softened with a flicker of pity for her current state, but his voice remained firm. "Your suffering in this tower is real, Mother," he said. "But its true root lies in the choice you made, not in any cruelty from others."
At these words, Queen Anna turned away from him to face the window again, and though she said nothing, a single tear traced a path down her pale cheek.
The elder Prince watched her still back, and he understood that facing one's own shadow, especially one so long denied, is perhaps the hardest task of all.
"I will leave you now, Mother," he said gently. "I shall return once more, at this same hour tomorrow."
Queen Anna did not respond, and the Prince departed, leaving her alone with the black thorn on the floor and the pitcher of now undrinkable water.
He walked from the tower feeling not triumph, but a heavy sense that truth, when long suppressed, must sometimes be spoken repeatedly, like a surgeon's knife that wounds in order to heal.
On the third day, when the elder Prince entered his mother's chamber in the secluded tower, the black thorn still lay on the floor and the pitcher of brackish water sat untouched; Queen Anna herself was pale and still, her eyes holding a new depth of shadow.
"Mother," he said, his voice filled with a sorrow that was for her as much as for himself and the kingdom, "I speak for the last time of this: your bargain for ease, your selfish choice, was the seed from which all our years of sorrow grew."
Queen Anna remained utterly silent for a long time, her gaze fixed not on him, nor the window, but on her own hands clasped tightly in her lap.
Then, as if the very air acknowledged the weight of unspoken words, a faint sliver of pure sunlight, the first seen in that tower for years, broke through the perpetually grey sky outside, touched her face for an instant, and then was gone, leaving her once more in deep shadow.
At last, she bowed her head, and a low whisper escaped her lips, barely audible, "It is true. My selfishness... it wounded all of you. I sowed a bitter seed from that darkness."
She did not look up, but added, even more quietly, "This shame is mine to bear, for all my remaining days in this tower."
The elder Prince heard her words, and in them he found no victory, only a profound sadness for the waste and the pain, and for the mother who had finally named her own poison.
"Acknowledgement is the first step on any path, Mother," he said quietly. "What follows from that, only time and hearts can tell."
Then he bowed once more, and left her to her solitude, her silence, and the heavy cloak of her finally acknowledged shame.
As the elder Prince walked away from the tower, he felt a bitter duty done, and though the sorrow remained, it was now a known sorrow, and a faint, clean wind seemed to blow through the passages of his own heart.
When spring returned to the land, though the kingdom's overall shadow lingered, the elder Prince felt an undeniable pull to revisit the Royal Preserve and the small patch he had tended.
He went there alone one bright morning and found that the tiny shoot was now a slender tree of breathtaking beauty, its leaves a vibrant green, and it glowed with a soft, inner light that defied the surrounding gloom.
As he approached, marveling, a single, perfect apple, the color of moonlight on snow, materialized on one of its branches.
The apple then gently detached itself and fell into his outstretched hand, and as he held it, the luminous tree itself spoke, its voice like rustling silk and clear water.
"Brave Prince," the tree whispered, "the seed you planted with such care was more than a simple seed; it was a vessel of ancient hope, tended by the magic of this old Preserve."
"From it, a new life, born of your care and the Preserve's pure spirit, now awaits your discovery in the deepest, most sacred grove within these woods."
"Her name is Cut-a-tree-na-na," the tree continued, its light pulsing gently, "and she holds within her the virtues your kingdom has lost through long sorrow: true seeing, gentle strength, and unwavering hope."
"Take this silver-white apple; it will guide your heart to hers, and it is an offering of a spirit that has learned to nurture life even in barren places."
The elder Prince looked at the luminous apple in his hand, and his heart felt a surge of warmth and a new and brighter hope than any he had dared to feel before.
He bowed to the glowing tree and vowed that he would seek out this Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na, this light in the deepest part of the Preserve.
Holding the silver-white apple, which pulsed with a gentle warmth in his palm, the elder Prince ventured further into the Royal Preserve than he or perhaps any other from the palace had ever gone before.
The apple led him through winding, overgrown paths until he came to a hidden, sun-dappled grove where the air was sweet with unknown flowers and the light was soft and golden.
In the very center of this grove stood a magnificent, ancient tree, far older and grander than any he had ever seen, its bark like silver and its leaves shimmering with all the hues of a rainbow.
And standing beside this tree, her hand resting lightly on its silvery trunk, was a young woman of such grace and luminous beauty that the Prince stopped, his breath taken away; this was Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na.
Her simple gown was the green of new leaves, and her dark hair was unbound, and her eyes, the color of clear spring water, held a gentle wisdom and a fearless compassion as they met his.
Then the great tree itself seemed to sigh, and a voice emerged from it, not unlike the Wild Man's, yet deeper, like the wind moving through a thousand leaves in harmony, "Welcome, Prince who tended the seed of hope."
"Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na is of my line, a daughter of this ancient wood," the tree's voice continued. "If you would win her hand and bring her light to your shadowed kingdom, you must show that you now embody the lessons this Preserve has striven to teach you."
"Three tasks of understanding I shall set for you now, Prince," the voice declared, its tone resonant and clear.
"For the first: a shadow has fallen even here, in the oldest part of this grove, cast by something that clings too tightly. Find what dims the sunlight from an ancient, sacred stone, and restore its light without force, using only what you have learned."
The elder Prince looked at the luminous Princess, then at the great tree, bowed his head respectfully and said, "I accept these tasks, and will strive to meet them with the understanding I have gained."
The elder Prince set out immediately, the silver-white apple still in his possession but its guidance now internalized, and he searched the oldest part of the sacred grove.
Soon he found it: an ancient, flat stone, carved with symbols he did not understand but felt were deeply important, lay half in shadow, not from a tree, but from a thick, clinging, shadowy vine that had overgrown it.
He remembered the Wild Man's first task, and the ancient, hollowed tree that still gave shelter and spoke of endurance, and he knew he must not simply tear this vine away.
So he sat quietly beside the stone for a while, observing the vine, then he found a sturdy, dead branch nearby and carefully propped it against a larger tree, creating a new path for growth.
Then, with utmost care, he gently loosened the main tendrils of the shadowy vine from the stone and encouraged them towards the waiting branch, which they slowly began to clasp.
Soon, the stone was free of the thickest coils, and the dappled sunlight now fell freely upon its ancient, carved symbols.
As he stepped back to observe his work, the great tree's voice sounded through the grove, "You have understood that even shadows have a place, if not allowed to overwhelm the light. The first task is well met."
The elder Prince turned and saw Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na watching him from beside the great tree, and for the first time, she offered him a genuine smile of approval.
"For your second task," the tree's voice resonated, "a stream that once nourished a now-parched part of this grove has been diverted by fallen debris from a storm long ago. You must restore its flow to the thirsty earth, but you may not break nor burn what has fallen to block it."
The elder Prince bowed again and replied, "I will endeavor to understand the stream's true course and the nature of its blockage."
So the elder Prince went in search of the parched earth and the diverted stream, a task requiring keen observation of the land's subtle contours.
He found it where a small valley narrowed: the dry bed of an old stream was clearly visible, and further up, a great tangle of an ancient, fallen log and smaller rocks from a landslide choked what must have been its original channel.
He recalled the Wild Man's second task, the stream that seemed to flow uphill, and how its true source was simple but cleverly hidden by the land's form; he knew this blockage too must be understood, not fought.
He studied the subtle dips and rises of the ground around the great log, and noted how a very small trickle of water still found its way past one end, though it quickly sank into the dry earth.
So, using his hands and a piece of sturdy bark as a small spade, he began to clear away loose pebbles and deepen that slight depression, arranging small flat stones to form a new, narrow channel leading from the trickle towards the parched bed.
Slowly, painstakingly, he worked, and after some hours, a thin ribbon of silver water began to follow his new path, winding around the end of the great log and onto the thirsty soil of the old streambed.
The dry earth drank greedily, and soon the path of the water was clear, bringing moisture to where none had been for a very long time.
As the Prince watched the life-giving water spread, the great tree's voice came to him again, softer this time, "You have seen that obstacles can be guided, and the true course can be found with wisdom that respects what has passed. The second task is also well met."
He looked towards the center of the grove, and Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na met his eyes, and this time her smile was accompanied by a clear respect in her gaze.
"For the third and final task," the tree announced, its voice now holding a profound gravity, "there is a rare songbird in this grove that has lost its voice, silenced by a fear it cannot name. You must help it sing again, but you may not command it, nor offer it a cage for safety, nor use any magic but that of a patient heart."
The elder Prince accepted this most subtle challenge, and for many hours he walked quietly through the sacred grove, listening not for a song, but for a silence where a song should be.
At length, he found it perched on a low branch of a flowering bush, a bird of exquisite colors, yet its feathers were dull, and it sat quite still, trembling almost imperceptibly, its eyes darting but never meeting his.
The Prince remembered tending the small seed in the blighted patch of the Preserve, how he had offered it water and protection day after day without immediate reward, and he knew this bird required a similar unwavering faith and gentle care.
So he did not approach the bird directly, but sat quietly some distance away beneath a neighboring tree, for the rest of that day and all through the cool night.
The next day, he returned to the same spot, and this time he softly hummed some of the simple, peaceful melodies the old Bard had taught him long ago, melodies of sunlight and quiet streams.
He also left a few fresh berries and a leaf-cup of clear water on a flat stone near its bush, then retreated to his spot, and he noticed the bird's trembling lessened slightly, and it tilted its head as if listening to his song.
For three more days he continued this gentle vigil, and on the morning of the fourth day, as the sun rose, the little bird took one of the berries, then it looked directly at the Prince, and let out a single, hesitant trill, then another, and then its throat swelled, and a full, clear, joyful song poured forth, filling the silent grove.
The great tree's voice resonated with warmth. "You have shown that healing comes from patience, understanding, and gentle encouragement, Prince. You have passed the three tasks of understanding."
Then Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na stepped forward, her eyes shining with a soft light, and she said to the elder Prince, "A Prince who understands these things, and who can call forth song from a heart silenced by fear, is one I would gladly join my life with."
She smiled then, a smile full of hope and promise, and placed her hand in his, and the sacred grove seemed to fill with an even brighter, purer light.
As the elder Prince and Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na joined hands, the great, luminous tree behind them shimmered intensely, its rainbow leaves swirling into a vortex of pure light.
From this light, the old Bard stepped forth, but he was no longer clad in his patched cloak; instead, he wore robes of forest green and silver, and a simple crown of woven leaves rested upon his brow.
"The Wild Man of the Preserve who set your first trials, the humble Bard of your father's court, and the King of this hidden grove are one and the same," he declared, his voice now clear and regal. "And I am Cut-a-tree-na-na's father."
The elder Prince was utterly astonished, but as he looked into the Bard-King's wise and now openly knowing eyes, he saw the undeniable truth of it.
The Bard-King smiled gently. "I have long watched your kingdom's sorrow from this hidden place, my son by marriage, and my daughter was indeed a seed of hope, waiting for one who could nurture her and himself with true understanding."
"Your earlier dismissal of my deeper lessons of the heart when I was but a travelling Bard," he added with a soft look, "mirrored, in its way, the very neglect that allowed the first shadows to take root in your father's house long ago. But you, Prince, have learned to listen truly now."
The elder Prince bowed his head, a flush rising to his cheeks at this gentle reminder of his youthful impatience, but he accepted this final truth with an open heart.
Soon, news of the elder Prince's betrothal to the wise and beautiful Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na, and the revelation of her father, the long-hidden Grove-King, brought a new stir of cautious hope to the sundered kingdom.
The younger Prince, seeing his brother's quiet transformation and the genuine light that now shone from him and his betrothed, was observed one day walking alone towards the edge of the Royal Preserve, a thoughtful and distant look upon his face.
And while the elder Prince and Princess Cut-a-tree-na-na began the slow work of bringing true light and understanding back to the heart of their people, the younger Prince's own journey into the whispers of the ancient wood, and what he might find or become there, is a story for another day.
