The Boy Who Learned the Winds Name
Once upon a time, high on a wind-swept mountain, there dwelt folk in a small village. The North Wind blew hard there. It swept the dust away in summer, but alas, it could also flatten the houses and tear away the thatch. The folk feared the wind.
There was an old tale told among them. It said the wind had a True Name, known only to the oldest stones and trees. And if a body knew this name, he might gain some knowing of the wind's ways, and perhaps speak with it.
A youth named Thomas dwelt in the village. He was no hero, nor was he book-learned. He was but a quiet boy. He helped his father mend the stone walls around their fields, which the wind pushed down many a time. He saw how the wind was fickle; sometimes it sighed like a babe, other times it roared like a beast. He saw the folk leave gifts of grain and sometimes a ribbon tied to a post, hoping to soothe the wind, but the wind paid them no mind and blew as it would.
But one year, the North Wind blew with great anger, day after day, week after week. It blew so hard that it flattened the fields of barley just as the grain was ripening. Hunger was nigh upon the village. The old folk sighed, and the women wept bitterly. They left bigger gifts, but the wind only howled the louder.
Thomas watched the poor, flat barley lying on the earth. He remembered the old tale of the True Name. The youth thought, "If I could but ask the wind why it blows so hard, mayhap it would hark to me."
So he decided he would seek the name. He went to the oldest wife in the village, whose grandmother had told her many tales. "Good mother," said he, "know you aught of the wind's True Name?"
The old wife looked at him kindly. "Hark ye," she whispered, her voice dry like leaves, "the old tales say the name is hidden. It is where three old things meet and speak. Seek the Standing Stones out on the Grey Moor. Then find the oldest Rowan tree that grows beside the Hidden Spring. Prithee, listen well. Mayhap they remember the name."
Thomas thanked the old wife and made ready. He took only a skin of water and a hard crust of bread. His heart beat fast, but he had a strong will, for the village folk were in great need. So the youth betook himself out onto the wide moor.
He walked for three days, and the wind blew hard against him. At last, he found the great Standing Stones in a circle. They were grey and cold as death. He sat among them, sheltering a little from the gale. The wind howled and moaned all about him. He put his ear close to the cold stone. He listened long, long. Naught did he hear but the wind's cry. But just as the sun began to sink low, there came a quiet moment. Then he heard, or felt deep inside the stone, a humming sound, deep and slow: "BOR." It was but one part of a word. Then the wind rose again, loud as thunder, and he heard naught more.
"Bor?" thought the youth. "That is not the whole." He rose and went on his way. He followed old sheep tracks until he came to where twisted Rowan trees grew among the rocks. He sought the oldest one. Its trunk was grey and scarred, and its branches clawed at the sky like old fingers. He climbed into its lower arms, out of the worst of the wind, and laid his head against the ancient wood. He listened to the creaking of the trunk and the rustle of the few tough leaves left upon it. Hark! After a time, a whisper came from the wood itself, a sound like dry twigs snapping: "EAS."
"Eas?" thought the youth. "Bor-eas?" That sounded more like a name. But he must find the spring.
At last, on the morrow, he came to a cleft between tall rocks. There was the Hidden Spring. The water was clear as glass and strangely still, though the wind blew hard just overhead. He knelt down beside it. He looked into the water, but saw only the grey sky rushing past. He put his ear nigh the water's edge. The spring made only a little bubbling sound. But as he listened, the bubbles seemed to make a soft, hissing sound, over and over: "SSSSS."
Then the youth put the sounds together in his mind: Bor-eas. He stood up straight. He drew a great breath. He whispered into the wind, "Boreas."
At once, the wind tearing through the cleft seemed to pause. It did not fall silent, but it felt as if it were listening. A great voice, vast and sighing like the wind itself, but clear in his head, spoke. "Who names me?" it said.
The youth was greatly afraid, and his knees shook, but he stood fast. "It is Thomas," said he, "a boy from the village yonder on the mountain. Great Boreas, why is thy wrath so great against us? Thou hast flattened our barley. We shall go hungry."
The wind's voice sighed all around him, old beyond knowing. "'Wrath?'" it said. "Nay, little one. I have no wrath. I do but blow, for that is my nature. Still air brings sickness and blight upon the land. So I sweep it clean. Your barley fell before my breath? Then it grew too proud on weak stalks this year. Better flattened by wind than withered by the rot I sweep away. Strength grows in the storm, not in hiding from it."
The youth listened. He did not truly understand all, but he knew the wind was not wicked. "But, alas," said he quietly, "we will starve."
"Did thy stone walls stand?" asked the wind.
"Yea," answered the youth. "My father and I mend them well."
"And the deep-rooted herbs that grow on the high rocks?" asked the wind.
"Yea," said the youth, thinking of the tough plants the old wife gathered. "They beest strong."
"And the oldest trees, did they break?"
"Nay," he answered. "Only the young, weak ones snapped."
"Then learn from them," said Boreas. "Learn from the stone, learn from the herb, learn from the old tree. Bend when you must. Stand strong when you can. Root yourselves deep in the earth. Do not trust only the easy grain that grows fast but snaps quick. I am the wind. I blow. Your living is in your strength, not in my stillness."
Then the voice faded. The wind still blew upon the moor, but to Thomas, it sounded less like anger and more like a great breathing, going on and on. He knew now he could not stop the wind. No man could. But he had spoken with it, and he had learned somewhat of its ways.
Then the youth went back to the village. He came home tired, but his eyes were clear. He told the elders and all the folk what Boreas had said. Some grumbled, saying, "Words do not fill bellies." But the wiser folk listened hard.
They gathered what little grain was left. They went out and gathered the hardy mountain herbs. They mended their stone walls stronger than before. When planting time came again, they planted smaller fields of barley, and fields of tougher rye beside them. They tended their hardy sheep with care.
That winter, they were leaner, it is true. But they had learned a lesson. They had more wit. They did not curse the wind so much, but built strong against it. The village lived on.
And the youth Thomas was held in honour among them, not for commanding the wind, but for having the heart to go out and listen to its True Name. And perhaps they dwell there still, building strong walls and planting hardy grain upon the wind-swept mountain.
