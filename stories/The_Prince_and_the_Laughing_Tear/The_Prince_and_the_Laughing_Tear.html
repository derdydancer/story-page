var analysisData = [{"Chapter Number": 1, "Grimm Style": "Adheres perfectly. Formulaic opening setup. Simple sentence structure. Introduces the King and his state via an external observation ('garden withered'). Archetypal elements (King, palace, garden). Functional description.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The King represents the ruling conscious principle, the Ego. His melancholy state and the withered garden symbolize a decline in vitality, a loss of connection to growth and the natural soul (Anima perhaps), or a depression affecting the whole psychic kingdom. The garden is often a symbol of the soul or the psyche's state.", "Moral Implication": "Sets a tone of decline and neglect at the center of power. Suggests something is wrong within the kingdom or the King himself, requiring intervention or renewal.", "Plot Function": "Establishes the initial state of the kingdom and the King's character (melancholy, weakened, fitting the Arthurian dark times inspiration). Introduces a problem implicitly: the lack of vitality.", "Sentence": "There was a king whose palace garden withered, though his gardeners worked hard.", "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Chapter Number": 1, "Grimm Style": "Simple sentence describing the Queen's action. Focuses on external behaviour (arranging, polishing). Contrasts with the King's neglect. Introduces the Queen.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Queen, as the feminine principle or Anima figure connected to the ruling Ego, attempts to maintain order and appearance ('polished silver') despite the inner decay (withered garden/King's melancholy). This suggests a focus on superficial control or denial, perhaps hinting at the Jocasta inspiration \u2013 maintaining facade over confronting uncomfortable truths.", "Moral Implication": "Shows a coping mechanism \u2013 focusing on external order when internal order is lacking. Raises questions about the Queen's awareness or priorities.", "Plot Function": "Introduces the Queen and her character \u2013 outwardly focused on order and appearance, potentially contrasting with or ignoring the deeper issues symbolized by the King and garden.", "Sentence": "His queen spent her days arranging the palace curtains and polishing the silver.", "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Chapter Number": 1, "Grimm Style": "Simple statement introducing the Prince and his defining characteristic relevant to the plot (cleverness) and his situation (returning). Uses 'it was said' which is a common folklore device for establishing reputation. Conforms to naming conventions ('king's son').", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Prince, the 'son' of the ruling Ego, represents the potential for renewal or the emergent heroic aspect of the personality. His 'cleverness' (Odysseus trait) suggests reliance on intellect and adaptability. His return signifies the arrival of a potential catalyst for change within the stagnant psychic kingdom.", "Moral Implication": "Introduces hope for the kingdom through the Prince's reputed abilities. Cleverness presented as a key trait.", "Plot Function": "Introduces the Prince, establishes his Odysseus-like characteristic (cleverness), and brings him into the situation as a potential actor.", "Sentence": "The king's son, who it was said was clever, was returning from a long journey.", "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Chapter Number": 1, "Grimm Style": "Simple description of a problem. Uses a concrete, slightly absurd nuisance ('clattering pot'). Focuses on the external effect ('kept all awake'). Avoids complex description. Introduces a minor antagonist/obstacle.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'clattering pot' could symbolize a persistent, irritating unconscious complex or unresolved issue that disrupts the peace of the conscious mind ('kept all awake').
