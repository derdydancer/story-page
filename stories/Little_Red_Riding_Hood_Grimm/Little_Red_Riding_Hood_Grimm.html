'Remained silent, and did not open the door' is a simple, direct description of their effective defense. Shows their united front. Consistent with direct narrative style.", "Moral Implication": "Silence and inaction (not opening the door) become powerful defenses against deception. They have learned not to engage with the predator on his terms.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego and the Wise Old Woman refuse to engage with the Shadow's deceptive ploy, maintaining their secured boundary.

Darkness is associated with danger and the wolf's evil intentions. This highlights the need for thoroughness in dealing with threats.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Shadow plans to attack when the Ego is transitioning or in a vulnerable state ('went home that evening,' 'in the darkness').
