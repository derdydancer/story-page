var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "Establishes the kingdom's unique and slightly absurd characteristic (extreme piety leading to odd customs), introduces the king, and sets a tone that allows for both seriousness and potential comedy.", "Grimm Style": "Opens with a kingdom and its ruler, a common fairy tale beginning. The specific custom (no metal) adds a unique fairytale quirk. Simple declarative sentence. 'There was once a king' is formulaic.", "Moral Implication": "Hints that extreme adherence to one principle (piety leading to no metal) might have unforeseen or impractical consequences, setting up potential problems. It could also suggest a kingdom that values spiritual matters over worldly ones, perhaps to a fault.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The kingdom without metal might symbolize an initial state of 'softness,' vulnerability, or a psyche that has rejected 'harder,' more assertive, or worldly aspects (metal as tools, weapons, currency). The king represents the ruling principle of this psyche, defined by this singular focus.", "Sentence": "There was once a king whose piety was so great that no man in his kingdom was permitted to carry anything of iron or steel, nor even of gold or silver, for these he deemed too worldly.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces the king's daughter, the princess, and her defining virtues: chastity and devotion to prayer. This immediately establishes her character type and primary mode of action or reaction.", "Grimm Style": "Simple introduction of the princess and her key traits. 'An only daughter' is a common motif, often signifying special importance or vulnerability. Her virtues are stated directly.", "Moral Implication": "Presents chastity and prayer as the highest virtues for the princess, in line with the kingdom's piety. This sets her up as a figure of purity who will likely rely on divine aid.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The princess, defined by chastity and prayer, represents an Ego focused on purity, spirituality, and perhaps a degree of passivity or reliance on higher powers rather than personal agency in a worldly sense. Her 'sole virtues' suggest a potentially one-sided development that will be tested.", "Sentence": "This king had an only daughter, whose sole virtues were her unblemished chastity and her constant prayers to God for guidance in all things.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Highlights a comical consequence of the kingdom's 'no metal' rule, affecting even the princess's daily life. This injects a touch of humor and absurdity, emphasizing the impracticality of the extreme piety.", "Grimm Style": "Use of a specific, slightly absurd detail (wooden hairpins, combs of bone) to illustrate a point, which is a Grimm-like way of showing rather than telling. Simple description of ordinary items made extraordinary by the rule.", "Moral Implication": "Subtly questions the practicality of extreme, unbending rules, even if well-intentioned. The princess's adherence shows her obedience to her father's decree.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The reliance on 'wood and bone' instead of metal for personal items reinforces the kingdom's (and by extension, perhaps the princess's initial psyche's) rejection of 'harder' or more refined worldly tools. It can symbolize a more primitive or unadorned state, or a deliberate eschewing of vanity/materialism. The comical aspect suggests this state might be somewhat unsustainable or naive.", "Sentence": "So it was that the princess combed her long hair with a comb carved of bone, and pinned it with pins of polished wood, for nothing sharper was allowed at court.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "Establishes the princess's daily routine, centered around prayer, reinforcing her pious nature and providing a contrast to the worldly events that will soon disrupt her life.", "Grimm Style": "Description of a routine, emphasizing a character trait. 'Each morning,' 'each noon,' 'each evening' creates a sense of ritual and constancy. Simple, declarative sentence about her actions.", "Moral Implication": "Her consistent prayer shows her devotion and her reliance on spiritual guidance. This dedication is presented as a core part of her character and will likely be her main recourse in times of trouble.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The princess's ritualistic prayer at set times indicates a highly structured spiritual life, perhaps a framework providing her with security and a sense of order. This reliance on prayer as her primary action suggests an Ego that seeks solutions or guidance from a transcendent source rather than through direct worldly engagement.", "Sentence": "Each morning she prayed for an hour, each noon for an hour, and each evening again for an hour, asking for protection from all worldly evils.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 4}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces the inciting incident: a demand from a powerful, neighboring king, signaling the first major threat to the peaceful, pious kingdom and directly to the princess.", "Grimm Style": "A common fairy tale catalyst: a demand from a more powerful external force. The 'great king from a heathen land' immediately establishes an antagonist and a clash of values (pious vs. heathen). Simple statement of a new development.", "Moral Implication": "The peaceful, pious life is about to be challenged by worldly power and different values. This sets up a test of faith and resilience for the kingdom and the princess.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'great king from a heathen land' represents a powerful, external worldly force or a challenging aspect of the Shadow (unintegrated, 'heathen' parts of the psyche) making demands on the established order. This intrusion threatens the Ego's (princess's) protected, spiritualized state and forces an engagement with the 'other.'", "Sentence": "One day, a messenger arrived from a great king who ruled a heathen land nearby, a land rich in iron and all manner of worldly goods.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "The neighboring king's demand is revealed: he wants the pious king's daughter as a bride for his son, or he will wage war. This creates a high-stakes dilemma for the pious king and his daughter.", "Grimm Style": "The demand is clear and comes with a dire threat (marriage or war), a classic fairy tale conflict. The 'son of this heathen king' introduces another character, the potential bridegroom. The language is direct and formal.", "Moral Implication": "The princess is treated as a political pawn. The choice is between compromising their values (marrying into a heathen, worldly family) or facing destruction. This tests the king's piety against his love for his daughter and kingdom.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The demand for the princess's hand by the 'heathen prince' symbolizes a forced union with the 'other' or the Shadow. It's a call for the pure, spiritualized Ego to integrate with, or be overwhelmed by, more worldly, perhaps instinctual or repressed parts of the psyche. The threat of war represents the destructive consequences of refusing this call to engagement or integration.", "Sentence": "This heathen king demanded the princess's hand in marriage for his eldest son, threatening war and devastation if his request was refused.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 6}, {"Plot Function": "Shows the pious king's reaction: distress and prayer, consistent with his character. His inability to fight due to his own laws highlights the kingdom's vulnerability.", "Grimm Style": "The king's reaction ('wept wooden tears,' a slightly comical, absurd image reflecting the 'no metal' rule) is consistent with the established tone. His recourse to prayer is typical. The dilemma of his own laws preventing defense is an ironic twist.", "Moral Implication": "Illustrates the potential downfall of unyielding principles when faced with harsh realities. The king's piety has made his kingdom defenseless. His prayer shows his faith, but also his practical helplessness.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The king's 'wooden tears' symbolize a grief that is constrained or made somewhat artificial by his rigid principles. His inability to fight represents the ruling principle of the psyche being hamstrung by its own self-imposed limitations (rejection of 'iron'). Prayer is his only recourse, indicating a hope for transcendent intervention when worldly defenses are absent.", "Sentence": "The pious king wept wooden tears, for his kingdom had no swords of iron nor shields of steel, and he prayed for three days and three nights for a sign.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 7}, {"Plot Function": "No divine sign is given, forcing a decision. The princess, true to her virtues, accepts her fate to save the kingdom, relying on prayer for her protection.", "Grimm Style": "The lack of a sign emphasizes their isolation or the need for human action. The princess's decision is one of self-sacrifice. Her statement of relying on prayer is key to her character. Her dialogue is simple and pious.", "Moral Implication": "When divine intervention is not forthcoming, personal sacrifice for the greater good is shown as a virtuous path. The princess's faith remains her shield, even as she steps into danger.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The absence of a 'sign' forces the Ego (princess) to make a choice based on its established values (sacrifice, faith) rather than external guidance. Her acceptance of the marriage to save the kingdom is a form of Ego-sacrifice, stepping into the unknown (the 'heathen' realm) armed only with her spiritual purity. This is a necessary step into the ordeal for growth.", "Sentence": "But no sign came, and at last the princess said to her father, 'Let me go to this heathen prince, dear father, and my prayers shall be my shield and my chastity my fortress.'", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 8}, {"Plot Function": "The princess sets off on her journey, equipped in a manner consistent with her kingdom's customs, highlighting their peculiarity and her humble, non-worldly departure.", "Grimm Style": "Description of the journey's beginning. The details of her attire and transport (linen, unsaddled donkey, wooden flask) reinforce the kingdom's unique, non-metallic customs and her simple, unostentatious departure. This contrasts with typical royal bridal journeys.", "Moral Implication": "Her humble departure, devoid of worldly riches, emphasizes her reliance on inner virtue rather than external trappings. It portrays a stark contrast to the 'heathen land rich in iron' she is going to.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The princess's departure on an 'unsaddled donkey' (symbol of humility, peace, perhaps stubbornness) and with only 'wooden flask and oaten cakes' signifies the Ego embarking on its journey with minimal worldly resources, relying instead on its internal state (purity, faith). This emphasizes her vulnerability but also her uncorrupted nature as she enters the realm of the 'other.'", "Sentence": "So the princess was sent forth, dressed in simple linen, riding upon an unsaddled donkey, with only a small wooden flask of water and three oaten cakes for her journey.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 9}, {"Plot Function": "The king's comical and impractical parting gift further emphasizes the kingdom's absurd adherence to its principles, even in dire circumstances. It also shows his loving but perhaps misguided attempt to provide for her.", "Grimm Style": "Introduction of a comical, impractical item (the 'blessed turnip') as a parting gift. This aligns with the established humorous undertone and the kingdom's quirkiness. The king's speech is earnest but misguided.", "Moral Implication": "Shows the king's deep love and piety, but also his lack of worldly wisdom. The gift is symbolic of their values but practically useless for her journey's dangers, perhaps highlighting the limitations of faith without practical means.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'blessed turnip' as a weapon/sustenance is an absurd symbol of the psyche's reliance on purely spiritual or naive defenses when facing worldly threats. It represents a well-intentioned but ultimately inadequate tool given by the old ruling principle (king), highlighting the need for the Ego (princess) to develop new coping mechanisms or strengths on her journey.", "Sentence": "Her father the king gave her a large, blessed turnip, saying, 'May this holy root sustain you, and its blessed hardness be your only weapon, for no other may you carry.'", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 10}, {"Plot Function": "The princess begins her solitary journey, immediately encountering a typically perilous fairy tale setting (a dark forest), signaling the start of her ordeals.", "Grimm Style": "Classic fairy tale journey motif. The 'dark and gloomy forest' is an archetypal setting for trials and danger. 'For seven days and seven nights' is a common fairy tale duration, indicating a significant period of travel or trial.", "Moral Implication": "The princess's solitary journey into a dangerous place underscores her vulnerability and the trials that often meet those who are pure or on a mission of sacrifice. It sets the expectation of hardship.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The journey into the 'dark and gloomy forest' represents the Ego's (princess's) descent into the unconscious, a place of unknown dangers, hidden aspects of the self, and transformative experiences. Traveling alone signifies that this part of the journey must be undertaken without external support from her familiar world.", "Sentence": "The princess rode upon her donkey for seven days and seven nights, until she came to the edge of a dark and gloomy forest.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 11}, {"Plot Function": "Her meager provisions run out, increasing her vulnerability and desperation. This common fairy tale trope heightens the stakes and the princess's reliance on her faith.", "Grimm Style": "Simple statement of dwindling resources ('oaten cakes were eaten, and her wooden flask was dry'). This practical problem adds to her peril and is a common element in quest narratives.", "Moral Implication": "Material sustenance is finite, emphasizing the need for spiritual reliance or unexpected aid. This tests her faith when worldly comforts are gone.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The depletion of provisions symbolizes the exhaustion of the Ego's initial, superficial resources or comforts. This forces a deeper reliance on inner strengths (her prayers) or a confrontation with more primal needs and fears as she faces the trials of the forest (the unconscious).", "Sentence": "By this time, her three oaten cakes were eaten, and her wooden flask was dry.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 12}, {"Plot Function": "True to her character, the princess turns to prayer in her moment of need, her primary coping mechanism and source of strength.", "Grimm Style": "Character consistency: the princess resorts to prayer. 'Knelt upon the mossy ground' is a simple, visual description of her pious action. Her plea is direct and humble.", "Moral Implication": "Reinforces prayer as her main virtue and source of help. It shows her unwavering faith even in dire circumstances. The story will test whether this faith is sufficient.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "In the face of dwindling external resources and the daunting forest (unconscious), the princess (Ego) turns to her primary spiritual practice (prayer). This signifies an appeal to a higher power or deeper psychic resources for guidance and sustenance when superficial supports have failed.", "Sentence": "She knelt upon the mossy ground at the forest's edge and prayed to God for sustenance and protection.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 13}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces a new, unsettling character \u2013 a hideously ugly old man \u2013 who appears seemingly in answer to her prayer, but his appearance is more threatening than helpful. This is the first 'cruel character' encounter.", "Grimm Style": "Sudden appearance of a new character, a common fairy tale device. The description ('hideously ugly old man,' 'clothes of patched leather,' 'eyes like a pig') uses stark, functional adjectives to create an unpleasant image. This character is an archetypal unsettling figure.", "Moral Implication": "Answers to prayer may come in unexpected or even frightening forms. This challenges the princess's perception of divine aid and introduces a potentially malevolent force.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'hideously ugly old man' emerging from the forest (unconscious) can represent a grotesque, primitive, or neglected aspect of the Shadow, or a dangerous trickster figure. His appearance in response to prayer suggests that appeals to the unconscious can stir up not only benevolent but also challenging or primaeval contents.", "Sentence": "As she finished her prayer, a hideously ugly old man stepped out from behind a twisted tree; his clothes were of patched leather, and his eyes were small and red like those of a pig.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 14}, {"Plot Function": "The old man speaks, his words being coarse and demanding, immediately establishing his unpleasant and potentially aggressive nature. This interaction marks the beginning of a direct ordeal.", "Grimm Style": "Direct, rude speech from the new character ('What make you here, wench...'). 'Wench' is an archaic and derogatory term. His sniffing and gruff question create an immediate sense of menace. Simple, impactful dialogue.", "Moral Implication": "The princess's piety is immediately confronted by coarseness and disrespect. This tests her ability to maintain her composure and virtue in the face of vulgarity and threat.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The old man's (Shadow figure's) coarse speech and aggressive questioning represent a direct, unrefined challenge from the unconscious. He seeks to know the Ego's (princess's) purpose in this liminal space (forest edge), testing her resolve and purity with his base energy.", "Sentence": "He sniffed the air and spoke in a voice like stones grinding together, 'What make you here, wench, caterwauling in my wood?'", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 15}, {"Plot Function": "The princess responds truthfully and piously, explaining her situation and her reliance on God. This maintains her character consistency even when faced with a threatening figure.", "Grimm Style": "The princess's reply is polite ('Good sir') despite his rudeness, and she states her mission and faith clearly. This contrasts her refined speech with his coarseness. Direct and honest dialogue.", "Moral Implication": "The princess maintains her dignity and piety even when addressed rudely. Her unwavering faith is her constant refrain. This shows her steadfastness.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The princess (Ego) responds to the Shadow's (old man's) challenge with her established identity (pious traveler, trusting in God). This is her attempt to apply her known framework to this new, unsettling encounter. Her politeness in the face of his rudeness highlights the clash between her refined consciousness and this raw unconscious figure.", "Sentence": "The princess, though frightened by his appearance, replied, 'Good sir, I am a king's daughter on a journey to be wed, and I trust in God to see me safely to my destination.'", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 16}, {"Plot Function": "The old man mocks her faith and offers a cruel bargain: her chastity for food and passage.

The mannikin's relief suggests his own ordeal might also be nearing an end if his plan worked.", "Sentence": "The Spider Sage, after much pondering and examining the princess with eight shimmering eyes, agreed to lift the curse from her tongue by spinning a tiny thread of moonlight and truth, which he then deftly plucked from her tongue; but only if she vowed to keep seven years of complete silence thereafter.", "Chapter Number": 7, "Sentence Number": 69}, {"Plot Function": "The princess agrees to the vow of silence. Her speech curse is lifted. The mannikin, his purpose served and perhaps his own curse also resolved (if he was the Ant Prince who has now regained favor), restores her to her original size and then vanishes, leaving her free but silent, and with her original ordeal (marriage) still technically unresolved but her immediate magical torments ended.", "Grimm Style": "Magical restoration and disappearance of the tormentor. The princess willingly takes the vow. The mannikin restoring her size is a final act, closing his arc. His vanishing leaves her in a new state: free from him and the curse, but silent and still with her original quest incomplete. This is a partial resolution, common before a final 'happily ever after'.", "Moral Implication": "The princess gains agency by choosing silence over cursed speech. The mannikin's departure signifies the end of one major phase of her trials. Her restoration to normal size indicates a return to her proper state, though her journey isn't fully over. The comedic/cruel tormentor arc is resolved.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The princess (Ego) accepting the vow of silence and being freed from the speech curse signifies a major healing: the distortion is gone, replaced by chosen inwardness. The mannikin (internal complex) restoring her size and vanishing implies this complex has been resolved, integrated, or has completed its function (perhaps he was the Ant Prince, and his success with the Termites, thanks to the princess's curse, led to his own restoration by the Ant King, hence he 'fixes' the princess as a final act). The Ego is restored to its proper scale but now enters a period of silence for deeper integration. Her original ordeal (marriage) is still pending, but she approaches it transformed.", "Sentence": "The princess readily agreed, and once her tongue felt blessedly normal, the mannikin, with a tiny, almost regretful nod, clapped his hands thrice more, and she grew back to her own size as he himself shimmered and vanished, leaving only the scent of turnips and damp earth behind.", "Chapter Number": 7, "Sentence Number": 70}];
