The Sundered Kingdom and the Queen's Shadow

ACT I

Scene 1: A Flourishing Realm

(Setting: The sunlit gardens of the Royal Palace. KING PETER smiles, watching his sons. PRINCE PHILIP, a youth, reads a large book. PRINCE WILLIAM, younger, observes a butterfly. QUEEN ANNA stands nearby, beautiful but with a subtle weariness.)

KING PETER:
Behold, my love, our kingdom basks in peace,
The fields yield bounty, and all troubles cease.
Our rivers gleam, our people sing with joy,
And heaven’s blessing touches girl and boy.
Our Philip delves in ancient, wisdomed lore,
While William finds what nature has in store.
And you, my Queen, the jewel of this land,
With gentle heart and ever-helping hand.

QUEEN ANNA:
(Forces a smile)
Indeed, my King, the sun shines bright and clear,
Yet in my spirit, husband, dwells a fear.
A shadow falls, a chill I cannot name,
Extinguishing my spirit’s vital flame.
I pray you, grant me leave to cross the sea,
To seek a cure for what encumbers me.
A distant land, a hope, however slight,
Might banish darkness and restore my light.

KING PETER:
(His smile fades; he takes her hand)
Your words, my Anna, strike me to the core.
To see you dimmed, I can endure no more.
If journeying may bring your spirit ease,
Then sail you shall, upon the ocean breeze.
Though parting rends my heart, I bid you go,
And may fair winds attend you, to and fro.
Return to us, your laughter light and free,
As you once were, and evermore shall be.

(QUEEN ANNA nods, a flicker of relief in her eyes. PHILIP looks up from his book, concerned. WILLIAM watches his mother with quiet apprehension. ANNA exits, attended.)

PHILIP:
(To Peter)
Father, will Mother truly find her cure
Beyond the waves, on some forgotten shore?

KING PETER:
We trust in hope, my son, and fervent prayer.
Now to our duties; banish all despair.

(King Peter puts a hand on Philip’s shoulder, a heavy sigh escaping him. The scene darkens slightly.)

Scene 2: The Sorcerer's Tower

(Setting: A bleak, rocky shore. A tall, dark tower looms. QUEEN ANNA, looking weary from her journey, approaches the tower. The great door creaks open.)

(Inside, THE SORCERER sits on a high-backed chair, robed in midnight black. His eyes are cold and piercing.)

SORCERER:
Enter, Queen Anna. I have sensed your plight.
The shadow on your heart obscures your light.
You come for healing, for a spirit freed.
But every magic has its price, its need.
What will you give, to cast this gloom away?
Speak from your heart, and do not now delay.

QUEEN ANNA:
(Her voice strained, desperate)
Oh, learned master, if your art can mend
This fractured spirit, make this torment end,
Then ask you may for treasure, land, or gold,
My kingdom’s coffers freely I’ll unfold.
Yes, anything! Whate’er the cost may be,
If only you will lift this woe from me!

SORCERER:
(A faint, chilling smile touches his lips)
Your worldly wealth, O Queen, I do not crave.
A different tribute from your soul I’ll save.
When next you hold, apart from kith and kin,
A thing most precious, joy deep-seated within,
From that adored and cherished, treasured prize,
A sliver of its light before your eyes
I’ll take, as payment for your heart’s release.
Agree to this, and find your spirit’s peace.

QUEEN ANNA:
(Clutching her chest, relief warring with unease)
A sliver of joy? From what I hold most dear?
If that will banish this consuming fear,
Then I agree! Your price I shall fulfill.
Let sorrow cease, and let my heart be still!

(THE SORCERER raises a hand. A cool mist touches QUEEN ANNA’s brow. She sighs, a genuine smile gracing her lips for the first time in ages.)

QUEEN ANNA:
The weight is gone! The darkness takes its flight!
My thanks, wise Sorcerer, for this restored light!

(She turns to leave. A faint, dark, unseen thread seems to attach to her, leading back towards the SORCERER.)

SORCERER:
(To himself, as she departs)
The bargain’s struck. The kingdom’s joy shall wane,
A subtle thread, to draw its light again.

(The scene fades.)

Scene 3: The Crown and the Cost

(Setting: The Great Hall of the Royal Palace. Festive decorations. KING PETER, PRINCE PHILIP, PRINCE WILLIAM, COURTIERS. QUEEN ANNA enters, looking radiant. All cheer.)

KING PETER:
My dearest Anna! Welcome to our sight!
Your eyes once more with their old sparkle bright!
The kingdom celebrates, our hearts aflame,
To hear you laugh and speak your cherished name!

QUEEN ANNA:
(Smiling warmly)
The journey’s end has brought me blessed relief.
Gone is the shadow, vanished is the grief.

COURTIER 1:
(Stepping forward with a velvet cushion, upon which rests a magnificent CROWN set with seven white gems)
Your Majesties, a gift from lands afar,
From King Theodoric, bright as any star!
A crown of friendship, for our Queen so true,
With seven gems, of purest, brilliant hue!

(All murmur in admiration. The CROWN gleams brightly.)

KING PETER:
(Taking the CROWN)
A wondrous piece! My Queen, its beauty see.
Hold it aloft, for all the court and me.

(He places the CROWN in QUEEN ANNA’s hands. She gazes at it, her eyes filled with a sudden, intense love for the beautiful object.)

QUEEN ANNA:
(Lifting it)
Oh, radiant diadem! So pure, so fine!
A treasure perfect, gloriously divine!

(At that moment, a slight tremor is felt (sound effect). The light from the CROWN’s seven gems visibly dims. QUEEN ANNA gasps, looking around in sudden fear. No one else seems to notice the change in the CROWN’s lustre or the tremor.)

QUEEN ANNA:
(Whispering)
What… what was that? The light… it seemed to fade!

KING PETER:
(Smiling, not noticing)
Its splendour suits you, Queen. A worthy aid
To grace your brow. The realm rejoices now!

(Cheers erupt, but QUEEN ANNA stares at the slightly dimmed crown, a cold dread settling in her heart. The unseen thread from the Sorcerer’s tower tightens.)

NARRATOR (Voiceover, as lights dim slightly on the scene):
From that day forth, a change began to creep,
A subtle shadow, secrets buried deep.
The kingdom’s colours seemed to lose their shine,
And laughter lessened, joy began to pine.
The Queen grew quiet, bearing in her breast
A heavy stone, a truth she kept suppressed.

(Scene ends.)

Scene 4: The Sundered Land

(Setting: Years later. A bleak landscape. A vast, dark, thorny FOREST stretches across the stage, dividing it. KING PETER, older and more careworn, stares at it. PRINCE PHILIP, now a young man, stands beside him, solemn. PRINCE WILLIAM, also older, observes the forest’s edge with a sorrowful expression.)

KING PETER:
This cursed wood, that sprang up in a night!
A monstrous barrier, banishing the light!
It splits our kingdom, like a grievous wound,
Where open plains and fertile fields were found.
My wisest men can find no path, no way,
Through tangled thorns that steal the light of day.

PHILIP:
A suffocating darkness lies within,
As if the very land itself feels sin.
What blight is this, that tears our world apart?
And plants this sorrow deep in every heart?

WILLIAM:
(Quietly)
The birds sing not beyond its shadowed edge,
The deer turn back, from that dark, thorny hedge.
Even the wind seems hushed and full of dread,
As if it mourns for something lost, or dead.

(QUEEN ANNA enters, older, more withdrawn. She looks towards the forest with an expression of deep, hidden pain.)

KING PETER:
(Turning to her)
My Queen, you gaze upon this woeful sight.
Do you know aught of this unending night?
This blight that on our sundered kingdom lies?

QUEEN ANNA:
(Her voice low, avoiding his gaze)
I only see the sorrow in its rise.
A tragedy that chills us to the bone.
The kingdom’s heart, it seems, has turned to stone.
(She turns away, clutching her hands.)

NARRATOR (Voiceover):
And so the years in muted sadness passed,
The forest stood, its grim enchantment cast.
The King grew grey, his laughter heard no more,
While Philip pondered ancient, hidden lore.
And William walked where sunlight still could reach,
Beyond the forest’s dark and silent breach.
The Queen her secret shame and sorrow bore,
And joy seemed lost, forevermore.

(The scene fades.)

ACT II

Scene 1: A New Queen, A Forbidden Place

(Setting: The Royal Court, years later. The atmosphere is subdued. KING PETER, greyer still, sits enthroned. QUEEN PETRA, fair and gentle, sits beside him. Her children, SEBASTIAN and JOSEFINE, play nearby, their cheerfulness a stark contrast.)

KING PETER:
(With a sigh, attempting a smile for Petra)
Your presence, Petra, brings a gentle gleam
To this old court, a half-forgotten dream
Of sunnier days. Though shadows still hold sway,
You bring a kinder light to guide our way.

QUEEN PETRA:
My lord, I strive to soothe this kingdom’s ache,
And for your sons, a mother’s care to wake.
Though Philip’s gaze is solemn and profound,
And William seeks the wild, where peace is found.
(She glances at PHILIP, who stands apart, observing.)
My children, too, bring laughter, fresh and new.

(SEBASTIAN and JOSEFINE laugh as they chase a butterfly. PHILIP watches them, his expression unreadable. WILLIAM is absent.)

PHILIP:
(Muttering to himself)
New laughter echoes where the old has died,
While truth and sorrow are still pushed aside.

QUEEN ANNA:
(Appears at a distance, frail and pale, watching from a shadowed archway. Her gaze is fixed on Philip.)
(Whispering, unheard by others)
The new queen’s sun, a fragile, borrowed thing…
While deeper currents poison everything…

QUEEN PETRA:
(To King Peter, gently)
My King, for the protection of the deer,
And rare white stags that banish every fear,
The Royal Preserve, deep in our remaining land,
I would declare forbidden, by your hand.
Let none disturb its ancient, hallowed peace,
Save for your huntsmen, till all dangers cease.

KING PETER:
(Wearily)
A wise decree. So let it be proclaimed.
The Preserve closed, its sanctity reclaimed.

(PHILIP overhears this, a strange look on his face. He feels an inexplicable pull towards the Preserve.)

PHILIP:
(To himself)
The Preserve… forbidden now? A curious thing.
What secrets might its sun-dappled forests bring?
My mother spoke… of ancient, lingering might…
A place to heal… or bring dark truths to light?

(QUEEN ANNA watches PHILIP intently from the shadows, a subtle, knowing smile on her lips. WILLIAM enters quietly, having heard the decree. He looks from PHILIP to the distant, unseen Preserve, a frown of concern on his face.)

(The scene fades.)

Scene 2: Whispers and Resolve

(Setting: QUEEN ANNA’s remote chambers. Dimly lit. QUEEN ANNA is frail, seated. PRINCE PHILIP enters.)

QUEEN ANNA:
My son, you come. Your presence warms this chill.
The kingdom sighs, its joyous heart stands still.
You see the shadows, feel the land’s despair?
A weight too great for one young heart to bear.

PHILIP:
Mother, the grief consumes me, day by day.
The sundered land, the light all slipped away.
What is this blight? What hidden, evil hand
Has cast this pall of sorrow o’er our land?

QUEEN ANNA:
(Her eyes burn with a strange light)
Look to the new queen, with her gentle guise,
Her quiet grasping, mirrored in her eyes.
And see your father, weakened by his pain,
Allowing shadows in his court to reign.
Their subtle schemes, their quiet, soft deceit,
Have brought our noble kingdom to defeat.

PHILIP:
(His heart heavy, absorbing her words)
You speak of Petra? And my father’s will?
That they are cause for all that makes us ill?

QUEEN ANNA:
The truth is bitter, son, but truth it is.
They thrive upon the kingdom’s artifice.
But in the Royal Preserve, now locked and barred,
Old magic sleeps, a potent, ancient guard.
A secret there, perhaps, could break the spell,
Restore our light, and make the kingdom well.
And I, your mother, to my rightful place,
Could be returned, with dignity and grace.

PHILIP:
(His brow furrowed in thought, then hardening with resolve)
The Royal Preserve… If truth lies hidden there,
I’ll brave the ban, this burden I will share!
I’ll find this secret, whatsoe’er it be,
And fight to set our fractured kingdom free!
And you, dear Mother, shall again be hailed!

QUEEN ANNA:
(A faint, triumphant gleam in her eye)
My brave, good son. Your courage has not failed.
Go when the moon is dark, the shadows deep.
While unsuspecting guardians are asleep.

(PHILIP nods, determined. He exits. WILLIAM watches from a hidden doorway, unseen by Anna, his face etched with worry for his brother. He glances towards the symbolic Dark Forest, then back at his mother’s retreating form.)

WILLIAM:
(To himself, softly)
The Preserve calls him, with a whispered plea…
Or is it shadows, brother, blinding thee?
The forest sighs… it knows what truths remain…
And I fear knowledge born of deeper pain.

(Scene ends.)

ACT III

Scene 1: The Royal Preserve

(Setting: A moonless night. The edge of the Royal Preserve. PRINCE PHILIP cautiously bypasses sleeping GUARDS and finds a hidden, ivy-covered gate. He enters. The Preserve is ancient, peaceful. Moonlight filters through the trees.)

PHILIP:
(Whispering)
So this is it. The place of whispered lore.
No evil scent, no darkness at its core.
The air is still, the ancient trees stand proud,
No hint of malice in this leafy shroud.
My mother spoke of shadows, dark and fell,
Yet here, a sense of healing seems to dwell.

(He walks deeper into the Preserve. He comes to a clearing with a small, bubbling SPRING beside an ancient, silver-barked tree. An OLD WOMAN in simple grey sits by the spring.)

OLD WOMAN:
(Looking up as Philip approaches, her eyes clear)
You seek for something, Prince, in shades of night?
What brings you here, beyond the sun’s warm light?

PHILIP:
(Respectfully)
Good mother, hail. This place, what is its name?
And have you seen a darkness, or a blame,
Some hidden evil that has caused our plight,
And plunged our sundered kingdom into night?

OLD WOMAN:
This is a place of healing, deep and true.
The only evils that may pass it through
Are those that men within their own hearts bear,
Or in the whispered stories they ensnare.
Look to your own heart, Prince, with honest gaze,
Before you seek for shadows in this maze.

PHILIP:
(Abashed, a seed of doubt planted)
My heart? Your words, good mother, give me pause.
I seek to understand the kingdom’s cause…
Of sorrow.

OLD WOMAN:
The truth of sorrow, in a land distressed,
Is seldom found where blame is manifest.
But often in a story long forgot,
A vow once broken, a remembered spot.
Seek the reflection that will tell no lie,
It may show more than you desire to spy.

(The OLD WOMAN turns and seems to melt into the shadows of the trees. PHILIP is left alone, pondering her words.)

PHILIP:
"A story forgotten… a vow broken long ago…
Seek the reflection that will tell no lie…"
What can she mean? Where must my footsteps go
To find this truth beneath a clouded sky?

(He slowly exits the Preserve, his mind troubled, the first doubt about his mother’s tales taking root. Scene ends.)

Scene 2: The Mirror of Truth

(Setting: A dusty attic in the castle. PRINCE PHILIP searches amongst old chests and forgotten items. Days pass in montage – searching by day, pondering by night.)

PHILIP:
(Frustrated, then remembering)
"The reflection that does not lie…" A tale
My nurse once told, beyond time’s misty veil.
A mirror hidden, showing what was true,
Not what appears, to me or even you.
My mother bade them hide it, years before
She sailed away to that dark, distant shore.
It must be here! This attic, vast and old,
The secret that the wise dame’s words foretold!

(He finds a tall mirror covered with a heavy, deep blue velvet cloth. With trembling hands, he pulls the cloth away. The glass is clear but deep, swirling with mist, not reflecting him.)

PHILIP:
(Gazing into the mirror)
Oh, ancient glass, if truth you can impart,
Show me the sorrow that has rent our heart!
The story lost, the vow that was betrayed,
The hidden cause why all our joys have swayed!
Reflect the truth, and let no falsehood lie!

(The mists in the mirror swirl and clear. An image forms: QUEEN ANNA, younger, before the SORCERER’S TOWER.)

SORCERER (V.O. from the mirror’s vision):
A sliver of its light… I’ll take, as payment for your heart’s release.

QUEEN ANNA (V.O. from the mirror’s vision):
Then I agree! Your price I shall fulfill!

(The image shifts: ANNA holding the new CROWN, the gems dimming, the land’s tremor. Then the DARK FOREST springing up.)

PHILIP:
(Recoiling, a shard of ice in his heart)
No! Not for kingdom… but her own heart’s ease!
The crown’s lost light… the forest through the trees…
The bargain struck… her sorrow was the key,
Not Petra’s guile, nor Father’s frailty!
The blight, the sorrow, and the sundered land…
All sprung from Mother’s choice, her trembling hand!

(The image in the mirror fades. PHILIP covers it slowly, his face a mask of horrified understanding.)

PHILIP:
The tales she wove, a web of bitter lies,
To shield her guilt before my very eyes.
My father bears a grief he cannot place,
My stepmother brings kindness, warmth, and grace.
The source of all our kingdom’s deepest woe…
My own dear mother… dealt the cruelest blow.

(He descends from the attic, no longer a youth swayed by whispered blame, but a man burdened by a terrible, clarifying truth. Scene ends.)

Scene 3: The Queen's Confession

(Setting: QUEEN ANNA’s remote chambers. PHILIP enters, his expression grave and resolved. QUEEN ANNA looks up; a flicker of fear crosses her face.)

QUEEN ANNA:
My son. You’re changed. What news is in your gaze?
What have you found in those forbidden ways?

PHILIP:
(His voice low, but clear and firm)
I’ve seen the truth, Mother, within a glass
That shows what truly was, what came to pass.
Your journey to the Sorcerer, I know,
The bargain made, the seeds of all our woe.
The kingdom’s light, for your own spirit’s peace,
The price we paid, that sorrow might decrease
For you alone. The forest, dark and vast,
A scar from choices in a shadowed past.

(QUEEN ANNA bows her head. All artifice leaves her. A single tear traces a path down her cheek.)

QUEEN ANNA:
(Whispering, her voice broken)
It is… it is the truth, my dearest son.
My secret sorrow, ere my quest begun,
It blinded me to all but my own pain.
My blindness wounded, again and yet again.
I cannot now undo what has been done.
Beneath this weight, our lives have been outrun.

PHILIP:
(No triumph, only shared grief)
The cost is great. The land lies torn and sere.
And trust, like fragile glass, is shattered here.

(They sit in silence for a moment. The weight of years of secrets fills the room.)

QUEEN ANNA:
The shadow on my heart, before I sailed,
Was fear of fading, lest my spirit failed
To hold the King, to keep the people’s love.
A foolish vanity, sent from above
As punishment, perhaps. The Sorcerer’s art
Offered escape, a balm upon my heart.
I was too weak, too desperate to foresee
The endless consequence for all but me.

PHILIP:
(Quietly)
Understanding dawns, though late the hour.
The truth, though harsh, possesses its own power.
This knowledge now, a heavy, solemn stone,
Must be revealed, no longer borne alone.
To Father first, then William by my side,
And Petra too, where secrets used to hide.

NARRATOR (Voiceover, as lights slowly change, perhaps a faint ray of dawn appears):
The dark wood stayed, the crown remained still dim,
No magic swift repaired life’s broken limb.
But truth, once spoken, shed a fragile light,
And fragile bridges formed against the night.
Forgiveness slow, like shoots in barren ground,
In shared lament, a common hope was found.
And though the kingdom never fully healed,
The deepest shadow slowly was repealed.
And in that land, where sorrow long had reigned,
A quiet strength, a tender hope, remained.

(Philip helps his mother to her feet. They stand for a moment, a fragile understanding between them. The scene slowly fades to black.)

(End of Play)
