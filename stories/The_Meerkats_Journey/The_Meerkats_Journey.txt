The Meerkat's Journey
There was once a young meerkat who dwelt with his kin in a sun-warmed land of many burrows, where all lived in peace. He had a companion from his earliest days, another young meerkat of his own age, who was as a brother to him. Together they scampered among the tall grasses, dug for roots and grubs, and watched the great sky, and they knew naught of strife or hardship. But sometimes an old meerkat, his fur grey with many seasons, would tell tales of other lands beyond their own. He spoke of a great darkness that lay upon some parts of the world, and of a long shadow that crept ever outward. And he told of a thing of light, a potent charm kept by wise ones, that was carried by a chosen bearer to hold back the shadow. The young meerkat and his friend would listen to these words, their bright eyes fixed upon the old one. For a time all went on in their sun-warmed land as before, and the tales seemed but stories for the evening fire. Then one day, a hurried meerkat, dust-covered from long travel, came to their burrows bearing urgent tidings. He spoke of a great council to be held, for the shadow grew long indeed, and all were bid to gather at the meeting place of the elders.
So the young meerkat and his companion went forth from their own burrow to the great meeting place. Many meerkats were already there, their faces grave, and the air was still with anticipation. Among them, one stood apart, an older meerkat with a weary look, who held a thing of light wrapped in simple cloths. The eldest of their clan spoke, saying that the shadow spread further each year, and the thing of light must be carried to a distant stronghold of ancient power. Then a call was made for those brave enough to guard the bearer and the light on this perilous journey. A silence fell upon the gathering, for the meerkats were folk of peace and not warriors, and the way was known to be fraught with peril. Then the young meerkat stepped forward, his companion beside him, and he said, 'We will go and guard the bearer.' The old ones looked upon them, and the bearer of the light nodded slowly, accepting their pledge. Two other stout meerkats, more seasoned but few in number, also stepped forth to join their small band. It was decided they would leave at the first light of the new day, carrying the hopes of their people with them.
As the sun first touched the land, the small fellowship of meerkats set forth from their peaceful homeland. Little was spoken among them, for the path ahead was long and the burden of their task was great. The young meerkat had never held a sharpened stick for defense, nor faced any foe larger than a beetle. Yet he and his friend kept close to the weary bearer of the light, and watched the path with keen eyes. They travelled for many days, and the land grew harsh, with barren rocks and twisted trees replacing the soft grasses of their home. Then one evening, as dusk settled upon the silent wastes, dark shapes emerged from the shadows, their eyes glinting with cruel intent. A fierce fight began in the fading light, with sharp cries and the desperate clash of claws against rough hides. Though they fought bravely, the small band was broken, and the bearer of the light fell, wounded. The young meerkat and his friend were driven apart from the others in the confusion, finding themselves alone as the sounds of fighting faded. They were lost in the darkness of the harsh land, and the precious light was gone from their sight.
The young meerkat and his friend wandered for many days through the rocky land, under a grey sky. They found little food and less water, and their paws grew sore from the sharp stones. Then one dawn, they came upon tall figures in shining mail, warriors with stern faces and keen spears, who watched them from a ridge. These were warriors of a famed and hidden kingdom, and they took the two small meerkats for spies from the dark lands. The young meerkat tried to speak, to tell of their lost fellowship, but their small cries were not understood or heeded by the tall warriors. Before more could be said, other, darker figures, cloaked and silent, rushed forth from hidden places and seized them swiftly. These were servants of the dark lord himself, whose shadow they had fled, and they showed no mercy. The two friends were bound and carried to a forbidding stronghold, a fortress of black rock that stood under an ill light. There, in a vast, echoing hall, the young meerkat's dear friend was taken aside from him, chosen for some sinister purpose by a tall, cloaked figure. The young meerkat was left alone in a cold, dark cell, and could do naught but fear for what would befall his companion.
Days passed in darkness and fear within the cold cell, and the young meerkat expected little but an ill end. Then one night, a small shape slipped silently to his cell door, and a familiar voice whispered his name through the bars. It was his own dear friend, who had escaped his captors and was now clad in the dark garb of a guard. The friend spoke quickly of a hidden loyalty within the fortress, a secret cause to restore a rightful king who had been long lost to the shadows. He told the young meerkat that there was a chance for freedom, if he would join this hidden band. The young meerkat, with a full heart for his friend's bravery, pledged himself at once to this secret cause. The friend unlocked the door with a stolen key, and together they crept from the dark cell. They moved like shadows themselves through the stone corridors of the dark lord's fortress, past sleeping guards and watchful eyes. Their friend led them to a hidden chamber where a loyal few were gathered, planning their strike against the dark power. A daring raid was to be made that very night, to strike a blow at the dark lord and aid the lost monarch's return.
Under the cloak of deepest night, the small band of meerkats crept through the fortress and struck with swift purpose. The young meerkat, though small and unused to battle, darted past a hulking guard to unbar a vital gate, allowing others to pass. Shouts and alarms rose throughout the black stone halls as the loyal few fought with the strength of desperate hope. The young meerkat and his friend followed the others through the turmoil, towards the chamber where the rightful king was said to be hidden. There they found him, a meerkat of noble bearing, though his eyes were worn by long sorrow and imprisonment. With their help, his chains were struck off, and he stood tall once more, a light of true authority in his gaze. His voice rang out, and many guards, who had served the dark lord only from fear, cast down their weapons or turned to join him. The dark lord, a tall sorcerer of great and wicked power, saw his fortress turning against him and fled into the deepest shadows. By dawn, the fortress was taken, and the banner of the rightful king flew from its highest tower. The restored king gathered a host of loyal meerkats and other creatures who had longed for his return, and our young meerkat and his friend rode near him.
Swift riders brought word that a great city by the wide river, long loyal to the rightful king, was now besieged by the dark lord's remaining armies. The king and his host, with the young meerkat among them, rode without rest to save the imperiled city. They reached the city as the last light faded, and saw that flames rose from its walls, and its defenders fought hard but were few. With a great cry, the king's host fell upon the besieging army from the rear, like a storm from clear skies. The battle raged through the night, and the ground grew slick with the dew of combat, as the dark lord's forces fought with grim despair. In the heart of the fray, the restored king found himself beset by three of the dark lord's fiercest champions, clad in black iron. He fought them valiantly, but their blows were heavy, and his strength began to fail as one raised a great mace to strike him down. But the young meerkat, seeing his king's deadly peril, darted forward with a desperate cry and bit sharply at the heel of the mace-wielder. This unexpected attack from below, small as it was, caused the champion to stumble and his blow to go wide, giving the king a moment to recover. The king, with a mighty shout, struck down his off-balance foe, and seeing this, his warriors took fresh heart and drove the dark army from the city walls in a great rout.
The city was saved, and the dark power's might in that region was broken by the morning light. And it was said that the quest of the thing of light was now complete, its journey's end achieved with the city's liberation. The young meerkat, weary from his many trials, was then guided to a white ship waiting at the river's mouth, bound for a mystical land of healing and rest. His faithful friend chose to go with him, for their paths had been as one through shadow and light. They sailed for many days and came at last to gentle shores where the trees bore silver leaves and the air was sweet with unknown blossoms. The wise and ancient rulers of that land, kin to the restored king, welcomed them with great honor for their part in the victory. There the young meerkat found rest from all his wounds, and the memory of fear faded like mist in the sun. Yet, after a season of peace, the thought of his own sun-warmed land and his kin called to him once more. So, with blessings and gifts from the silver-leaved land, he and his loyal friend set sail again for their own shores. Their journey back was swift and the seas were kind, for the shadow over the world had greatly lessened.
At last they saw the familiar plains of their own country, and their hearts beat quicker at the sight of home. Their kin rejoiced to see them, for they had been given up for lost, yet there was an unease in the air, and many kept watchful eyes upon the borders. Not many days later, a band of gaunt and desperate creatures, remnants of the dark lord's scattered armies, came raiding into their peaceful land. The meerkats, though folk of peace, took up sharpened stones and stout sticks, and their eyes turned to the young one who had journeyed far and seen battle. He stood with them, his voice calm and clear, and showed them how to stand together and where to watch for the foe's approach. When the raiders came, the meerkats fought not for glory or for distant kings, but for their own burrows and their young. The young meerkat himself, with a well-aimed stone, brought down the leader of the raiders, and his steady courage was a shield to his kin. The desperate creatures were driven back from the sun-warmed land, and did not return, and the land was safe once more. After this last trial, the young meerkat lived again in peace among his kin, yet he was not the same as before his journey. His eyes held a distant light from the lands he had seen and the deeds he had done, and his words carried weight among his people for all his remaining days.
When he was old, with fur as grey as the first teller of tales, he too would speak of his long road and the courage found in unlikely hearts. His loyal friend was ever near, and their shared memories were a treasure richer than any gold. The thing of light, though its journey was ended, was remembered in their lore as a beacon against any returning shadow. The rightful king, saved by their courage, ruled long and well, and peace lay upon the lands he governed. The silver-leaved land across the waters remained a haven of quiet magic, seldom visited but never forgotten. And so the tale of the young meerkat who journeyed into darkness and saved a king was told from burrow to burrow. The sun warmed the land of many burrows, and the young ones played, knowing a peace their elder had fought to win. Because of him and his friend, and the few who dared, their small folk endured and knew many seasons of quiet days. He carried the memory of distant mountains and shining mail within his meerkat heart, a quiet strength that never left him. And there he lived to a great age, a respected elder in a land that remembered the long shadow, and the light that opposed it.
Long after, when the great wars were but a tale, shadow-stirrings were felt once more on the verges of the peaceful land from wild things pushed from darker places. The young ones, who knew peace as their only season, came to the old meerkat, their hero of legend, and his counsel was sought. He spoke not of great armies or shining kings, but of keen watchfulness, and strong hearts together, and the courage of the small. He said he would stand guard with them himself, his own paws, though gnarled with age, ready to defend the burrows. The younger meerkats took heart from his words and his quiet readiness, and they manned the borders with renewed spirit. The wild things from the verges, seeing such alert defense and finding no easy prey, soon troubled their borders no more. And so, the old meerkat saw his last seasons draw to a close in the enduring peace he had twice helped to secure. His old friend sat beside him in the warm sun of their last shared autumn, their tales now part of the wind's whisper. When he finally closed his eyes, they mourned his passing, but remembered his great heart and the paths he had walked for them all. His story became a guiding light for the young meerkats of that sun-warmed land for all time to come.
Many seasons turned, and the burrows remained safe, the borders quiet under the watchful peace their ancestors had won. Young kits, with eyes bright with unknowing, would gather at the feet of elders to hear the story of the meerkat who journeyed far. They heard of the thing of light, the perilous journey, and the shadow that was banished from the world by courage small and great. They learned of the king who returned, and of the friend who was true, and of the silver-leaved land where wounds were mended. And as they listened, their small hearts would dream not of war, but of the steadfast will that can face any darkness. The land of many burrows thrived, its peace guarded by the watchfulness and brave spirit that the old tales kept alive. The hero's faithful friend, too, became an elder of great wisdom, their twin story a rock against any returning tide of fear. The memory of their journey, from simple companions to saviors of kings, was a shield against despair for all their folk. And so, the sun-warmed land of the meerkats remained a place of quiet strength, its legends whispered on every breeze. And if the tale is true, as the old ones say, their courage still echoes in the heart of every young creature that looks to the horizon with brave eyes.
