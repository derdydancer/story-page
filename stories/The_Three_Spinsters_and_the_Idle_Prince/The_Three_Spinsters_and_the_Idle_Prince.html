var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "This sentence establishes the primary setting, introduces the main characters (king and prince), and the central problem or flaw of the prince: his idleness, contrasting with the kingdom's renown for industry (fine linen).", "Grimm Style": "The opening 'In a kingdom...' is archetypal for Grimm's tales. 'Famed for its fine linen' provides a simple, concrete detail linked to industry, a common theme. Character introduction is direct: 'king,' 'only son,' described with functional adjectives 'handsome' and a clear flaw 'exceedingly idle.' The language is simple, declarative, and sets a classic fairy tale tone. It follows the 'Do' list for 'Beginning the Story' by establishing the initial situation simply and introducing a core problem (idleness).", "Moral Implication": "The sentence immediately sets up a moral contrast between the kingdom's virtue (diligence in producing linen) and the prince's vice (idleness). It implies that idleness, even in a handsome prince, is a significant flaw, especially for a future ruler.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'kingdom famed for fine linen' can symbolize a well-ordered society or psyche where productivity and skill are valued (a well-functioning Ego and Superego). The 'handsome but exceedingly idle' prince represents the Puer Aeternus archetype\u2014the eternal youth who resists maturation and responsibility. His idleness is a failure of the Ego to engage with the demands of reality or to develop his potential beyond superficial attributes.", "Sentence": "In a kingdom famed for its fine linen lived a king whose only son was handsome but exceedingly idle.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "This sentence elaborates on the prince's idleness, specifying his unproductive activities and reinforcing his character flaw introduced in the previous sentence.", "Grimm Style": "The sentence uses simple, concrete verbs ('cared,' 'hunting,' 'feasting') and common nouns. The structure 'nothing but X all day and Y all night' is a typical parallel construction emphasizing the totality of his idleness. The tone is matter-of-fact, reporting his behavior without explicit condemnation from the narrator. This aligns with the Grimm style of showing character through action rather than deep psychological exposition.", "Moral Implication": "This reinforces the moral concern about the prince's lifestyle, showing a complete dedication to pleasure and a lack of constructive activity. It highlights a life of excess and irresponsibility.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Hunting and feasting, in this context, represent primal, perhaps hedonistic pursuits (Id-driven behavior) devoid of higher purpose or contribution to the 'kingdom' (the self or society). It signifies a life lived on a superficial or instinctual level, avoiding the challenging work of individuation or fulfilling one's duties.", "Sentence": "The prince cared for nothing but hunting all day and feasting all night.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "This sentence highlights the consequences of the prince's idleness from the perspective of the king and the kingdom, establishing the motivation for the king's subsequent actions.", "Grimm Style": "The king's emotion is stated directly ('despaired'), a common Grimm trait. The reasoning is simple and practical: 'the kingdom needed a future ruler who understood diligence.' This directly links to the kingdom's characteristic ('fine linen'). The sentence structure is a compound sentence linked by 'for,' explaining the cause of the king's despair. The vocabulary remains simple and functional.", "Moral Implication": "This sentence underscores the moral that leadership requires diligence and responsibility. The king's despair emphasizes the seriousness of the prince's flaw for the well-being of the collective. It highlights the value of industry for a ruler.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The king's despair can represent the concern of the Superego or the collective conscious about the undeveloped state of the Ego (the prince). 'Diligence' symbolizes the work ethic and constructive engagement necessary for a healthy society or a mature individual. The kingdom's need reflects the call to individuation and the assumption of adult responsibilities.", "Sentence": "The king despaired, for the kingdom needed a future ruler who understood diligence.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "This sentence initiates the central action of the story. The king's summons signals a turning point where the problem of the prince's idleness will be addressed directly.", "Grimm Style": "A simple, declarative sentence using common vocabulary ('king summoned his son'). 'One day' is a typical fairy tale transition to mark the beginning of a significant event. The active voice ('king summoned') is characteristic. It follows the Grimm style of clear, linear plot progression.", "Moral Implication": "This implies that inaction or flaws will eventually be confronted by authority or circumstance. The summons suggests a proactive approach to solving a problem, a parental responsibility.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The summons can symbolize an internal call to awareness or a life event that forces the undeveloped Ego (the prince) to confront its shortcomings. It is the catalyst from the 'Father Archetype' (the king) demanding growth and change.", "Sentence": "One day, the king summoned his son.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 4}, {"Plot Function": "The king begins to lay out his plan or decree, setting the stage for the quest the prince will be forced to undertake. This introduces the theme of marriage as a potential solution or catalyst for change.", "Grimm Style": "Direct dialogue, introduced with a simple tag 'he said.' The address 'Son,' is direct and typical. The statement 'it is time you took a wife' is a common fairy tale trope where marriage signifies maturity, alliance, or the continuation of a lineage. The language is straightforward.", "Moral Implication": "Marriage is presented as a step towards responsibility and adulthood. The king's statement implies a societal expectation and a traditional means of ensuring the future of the kingdom.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Marriage in fairy tales often symbolizes the union of opposites, or the integration of the Anima (for a male protagonist). The king's decree for the prince to find a wife can be seen as an attempt to push him towards this necessary psychological integration and maturation.", "Sentence": "\u2018Son,\u2019 he said, \u2018it is time you took a wife.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "This sentence details the specific, seemingly impossible condition for the marriage, establishing the core task of the story: finding a princess with extraordinary skills in textile arts. This task is designed to teach the prince the value of diligence indirectly.", "Grimm Style": "The king lays out a tripartite task ('spin the finest thread, weave the strongest cloth, and sew the most perfect shirt'), a classic 'Rule of Three' element common in Grimm's tales. The skills are concrete and relate to the kingdom's fame (linen). The timeframe 'in a single day' adds to the magical impossibility. The language is direct and demanding ('you shall only marry'). Adjectives are functional: 'finest,' 'strongest,' 'most perfect.'", "Moral Implication": "The task emphasizes extreme skill and diligence, qualities the prince lacks. It implicitly sets a high standard for the future queen, reflecting the kingdom's values. It suggests that true worth is found in skill and hard work, not just noble birth.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The creation of a perfect shirt in a single day is a metaphor for a complete, almost magical act of creation and transformation. The textile arts (spinning, weaving, sewing) often symbolize the weaving of fate, the creation of form from formlessness, or the integration of different elements into a cohesive whole. The task is a symbolic challenge for the prince to find or recognize true inner value, represented by these skills.", "Sentence": "But you shall only marry a princess who can spin the finest thread, weave the strongest cloth, and sew the most perfect shirt in a single day.\u2019", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 6}, {"Plot Function": "This sentence shows the prince's immediate negative reaction to the king's condition, highlighting his characteristic aversion to effort or difficulty.", "Grimm Style": "Simple, direct action: 'The prince groaned.' This clearly conveys his displeasure without lengthy description. The verb 'groaned' is concrete. This aligns with showing emotion through simple action or statement.", "Moral Implication": "The prince's groan reflects his laziness and unwillingness to face challenges. It contrasts with the diligence required by the task and expected by the king.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The groan signifies the Ego's resistance to the Superego's demands or the daunting nature of the individuation task. It's the reaction of the Puer Aeternus faced with a call to difficult but necessary growth.", "Sentence": "The prince groaned.", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 7}, {"Plot Function": "The prince voices his doubt and despair regarding the king's task, emphasizing its perceived impossibility.", "Grimm Style": "Direct dialogue. The question is simple and expresses his defeatist attitude. 'Where can such a woman be found?' uses common vocabulary. The sentence structure is a direct question. The tone is one of complaint, typical of an idle or spoiled character.", "Moral Implication": "This further illustrates the prince's lack of initiative and belief in the possibility of achieving difficult goals. He immediately assumes failure rather than considering how to approach the challenge.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The prince's question reflects a lack of faith in the existence of the 'ideal' or the fully developed Anima (represented by the skilled woman). He projects his own limitations onto the external world, seeing the task as impossible because he himself is unwilling to engage with effort.", "Sentence": "\u2018Father, where can such a woman be found?", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 8}, {"Plot Function": "The prince explicitly states his belief that the task is impossible, reinforcing his reluctance and setting up the challenge he must (or will try to avoid) overcome.", "Grimm Style": "A short, declarative statement in dialogue. 'It is an impossible task!' is a direct expression of his opinion. The exclamation mark adds a touch of his petulance. The language is simple and forceful.", "Moral Implication": "This sentence is a clear statement of the prince's idleness and defeatism. It highlights a key character flaw: the unwillingness to even attempt something difficult due to preconceived notions of impossibility.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Declaring the task 'impossible' is a defense mechanism of the immature Ego, protecting itself from the anxiety of potential failure or the need for strenuous effort. It's an attempt to maintain the status quo of his idle existence.", "Sentence": "It is an impossible task!\u2019", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 9}, {"Plot Function": "The king reaffirms his conditions, showing his resolve and dismissing the prince's complaints. This sentence reinforces the unchangeable nature of the quest's terms.", "Grimm Style": "The king's dialogue is firm and authoritative, typical of a royal figure in Grimm's tales.

'Day after day' highlights the constant, patient work required for such psychic processes.", "Sentence": "\u2018Aye,\u2019 said the second, \u2018from weaving, day after day!\u2019", "Chapter Number": 29, "Sentence Number": 74}, {"Plot Function": "The third spinster completes the explanation, attributing her deformity to working the loom, finalizing the reveal about the physical toll of their labor.", "Grimm Style": "Dialogue, completing the trio's explanation. 'Indeed,' is an affirmation. 'From treadling the loom, year in, year out!' emphasizes the long duration and cyclical nature of the work. This concludes the direct answers to the king's question.", "Moral Implication": "The third explanation seals the connection: their 'ugliness' is the direct, unavoidable consequence of the very skills the king (and initially the prince) sought. The story subtly shifts from valuing the skill to fearing its consequences.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The third spinster's statement completes the picture: prolonged, dedicated engagement with specific psychic functions (treadling the loom/rhythmic creation) leads to characteristic 'deformities' or specializations of the psyche. 'Year in, year out' speaks to the enduring nature of these processes.", "Sentence": "\u2018Indeed,\u2019 said the third, \u2018from treadling the loom, year in, year out!\u2019", "Chapter Number": 30, "Sentence Number": 75}, {"Plot Function": "This sentence describes the new princess's horrified reaction to the spinsters' explanations and her comparison to her own unmarred features, setting up her decision.", "Grimm Style": "The princess's reaction is conveyed through her look ('looked with horror') and her internal comparison ('then at her own delicate hands and feet'). This is a direct statement of her feelings and thoughts. 'Delicate hands and feet' contrasts with the spinsters' deformities.", "Moral Implication": "The princess, representing vanity or a love of ease, is horrified by the physical cost of diligence. She values her appearance over the virtue of hard work. This shows a superficiality similar to the prince's.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The new bride (representing a more conventional, perhaps superficial Anima or Ego ideal) is horrified by the 'deformities' (the visible marks of deep psychic work) of the spinsters (the Crone/Worker archetypes). She values her 'delicate' (undeveloped, unworked) state, fearing the transformative (and to her, disfiguring) power of such labor.", "Sentence": "The prince\u2019s bride looked with horror at the deformed women, then at her own delicate hands and feet.", "Chapter Number": 31, "Sentence Number": 76}, {"Plot Function": "The princess addresses her husband, the prince, preparing to make her declaration based on what she has just witnessed and understood.", "Grimm Style": "Simple action leading to dialogue: 'She turned to the prince.' This focuses the attention on her impending speech. The sentence is concise.", "Moral Implication": "Her turning to the prince implies she holds him partly responsible or expects him to understand her impending decision. It is a direct address before her significant pronouncement.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The bride turns to the prince (her new Ego partner) to announce her decision, which will shape their joint future. Her reaction to the spinsters will now influence his life directly.", "Sentence": "She turned to the prince.", "Chapter Number": 31, "Sentence Number": 77}, {"Plot Function": "The princess declares her intention to avoid all textile work for the rest of her life, based on her horror at its physical consequences. This is the ironic outcome of the king's original quest.", "Grimm Style": "Direct, firm dialogue. 'Husband,' she declared firmly...' shows her resolve. Her vow 'I shall never touch spindle, loom, or needle again as long as I live!' is emphatic and uses the triplet of tools. This is the story's punchline or ironic twist.", "Moral Implication": "The princess chooses idleness and preservation of her appearance over the virtues of skill and diligence. The story ironically suggests that demonstrating the 'ugly' side of hard work can lead to an aversion to it. This is a cautionary note against superficiality.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The bride's vow represents a conscious rejection of the type of deep, transformative labor embodied by the spinsters. She chooses to remain 'delicate' and undeveloped in that area, valuing superficial preservation over the profound (but 'deforming') engagement with creative work. The prince, through his deceit, has inadvertently secured a wife who mirrors his own idleness.", "Sentence": "\u2018Husband,\u2019 she declared firmly, \u2018if this is what comes of spinning, weaving, and sewing, then I shall never touch spindle, loom, or needle again as long as I live!", "Chapter Number": 31, "Sentence Number": 78}, {"Plot Function": "The princess delegates such labor to servants, reinforcing her commitment to idleness and her aristocratic disdain for manual work.", "Grimm Style": "A short, declarative command as part of her speech: 'Let the maids do such work!' This clearly shows her social standing and her attitude towards labor. It is a direct and concise statement of her expectation.", "Moral Implication": "This line reinforces the theme of class and privilege. The princess sees such labor as beneath her, suitable only for servants. It solidifies her choice of idleness, mirroring the prince.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Delegating the work to 'maids' signifies a desire to have the benefits of such labor (the products) without personal engagement or transformation. It's a further rejection of integrating these 'working' aspects into her own being, preferring to keep them external and subordinate.", "Sentence": "Let the maids do such work!\u2019", "Chapter Number": 31, "Sentence Number": 79}, {"Plot Function": "This final sentence concludes the story, stating the ironic outcome: the prince gets an idle wife due to his own deceit, and the spinsters are honored as promised, enjoying the feast. It delivers the story's ultimate moral and resolution.", "Grimm Style": "'And so,' is a classic concluding phrase. The sentence directly links the outcome (bride's idleness) to the prince's flaws ('forgotten promise and his shame'). The spinsters 'sat grinning at the high table, enjoying the best of the feast' provides a satisfying, almost triumphant image for them, fulfilling their condition. The ending is clear and decisive, typical of Grimm's tales, providing a sense of justice for the spinsters and an ironic fate for the prince.", "Moral Implication": "The story ends with multiple morals: deceit leads to unintended and often unwanted consequences (the prince gets an idle wife like himself). Broken promises can still yield a form of justice for the wronged (spinsters are honored). Superficiality (bride's horror) leads to choosing idleness. The spinsters, despite their appearance, achieve a place of honor through the prince's forced adherence to his vow.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The ending shows the ironic consequences of the Ego's (prince's) deceit and refusal to integrate. He ends up with a partner who mirrors his own undeveloped state (idleness). The spinsters (unconscious forces/fate) achieve their due recognition ('grinning at the high table'), symbolizing that these underlying principles ultimately assert their importance. The 'feast' they enjoy is their rightful share of the psychic energy or reward.", "Sentence": "And so, because of the prince\u2019s forgotten promise and his shame, his bride remained as idle as he was, and the three old spinsters sat grinning at the high table, enjoying the best of the feast.", "Chapter Number": 32, "Sentence Number": 80}];
