The Tower and the Queen's Thread
In a certain kingdom, men began to build a tower whose top should reach heaven. The king of that land ordered the work, and watched its progress daily from his palace. His son, the prince, often stood beside him, saying little but watching all. The tower grew stone upon stone, wider than any city, and its top climbed nearer the clouds each day. But around the tower's base, the wind blew colder than elsewhere, and birds sang no more upon its stones. Now, the queen, the prince's mother, dwelt apart in an old tower at the edge of the royal woods. It was said her hair, like spun night, had grown so long that it coiled upon the floor of her chamber. One afternoon, the prince rode alone towards his mother's tower. He found the tower silent, with no door at its base, and only one high window facing the setting sun. The prince shielded his eyes and called upwards, Mother, are you within?
After a time, the queen's face appeared at the high window, pale and unsmiling. What purpose brings you from the great work?, asked she. I came only to see you, mother, the prince replied. The queen unbound her hair then, and let it fall like a dark river down the smooth stone wall. The prince grasped the thick locks and climbed upwards hand over hand. He found her room was bare stone, with but a single chair and a spinning wheel by the window. The queen sat spinning thread that shone faintly in the dim light. What thread is that, mother, and what cloth will it weave?, asked the prince. It is the thread of consequence, she answered, and it weaves a shroud for ambition. The prince looked away from the shining thread and spoke of other matters until dusk.
When it grew dark, he climbed down the long hair and rode back to the palace. Work on the great tower continued; men labored day and night, and the king urged them onward. The master builder, a man with the cleverest hands in the kingdom, was said to seldom sleep. The prince sought out this master builder and asked, Is there any flaw in this great work? The stone is true and the craft is sound, answered the builder, but no tower stands forever on shifting earth. The prince nodded slowly but asked no more questions of the builder. The tower climbed higher still, until the world below seemed small as pebbles in a stream. Then whispers began among the workers that good iron tools were breaking upon the highest stones. The prince went himself by night to the tower's high summit, carrying his own hammer. He struck a newly laid stone, and the hammer's head shattered like brittle glass.
The prince returned before dawn and told no one what he had found. He no longer stood beside the king, but walked among the captains and chief masons. He spoke quietly with them, asking questions about supply, and sometimes gave counsel. The king marked this change in his son, but did not comprehend its meaning. Word reached the court that the queen in her tower still sat spinning her strange, shining thread. Then one morning, a great cry arose; stones at the tower's base had begun to crumble into dust. Fear seized the workers, and all work upon the tower stopped at once. The king was greatly dismayed and called his council, but none knew the cause or the cure. It was then the prince came before the king and the troubled council. Father, he said, I know the remedy for this ill, though it is one that few may welcome.
Speak quickly, son, said the king, for the kingdom fears the tower's fall. The weakness comes not from the earth, said the prince, but from the queen, my mother, in her tower. There was a great stir among the council, and many murmured against his words. Her spinning draws the strength from the stones; she unspins the thread of the tower's life each night. How can this be known?, demanded the king. What proof have you? My mother told me herself, when last I climbed her tower, the prince answered. The king sat silent for a long time, then spoke to his guards. Go to the old tower, bring the queen before us; seize her spinning wheel also. The guards marched to the woods and returned bearing the queen and her wheel. She stood pale before them, saying nothing, and the faint light still shone from the thread upon her wheel.
Is it true, woman, that you have worked against this kingdom's greatest work?, the king asked. What rises too high must fall, the queen answered softly. I only spin what must be. That is confession enough, declared the king. Let her be locked in the deepest dungeon. So the queen was led away, and the king ordered her spinning wheel broken into pieces. The prince watched all this happen, his face showing nothing. Now certain of success, the king commanded the work on the tower to begin anew. For a week, the building went well, but then the stones began to crumble faster than before. The great tower groaned, split from top to bottom, and fell into ruin upon the earth. Where it fell made a great ruin, and the king covered his face and wept. Only the prince stood dry-eyed, looking upon the wreckage.
Did you know this would happen?, the king asked his son, his voice rough with sorrow. A fall was certain, father, the prince answered. The foundation was unsound, and the tools broke. But you blamed the queen, your mother, said the king. You let her be imprisoned falsely. It was the only way, the prince replied, to make you cease the work before heaven struck it down. The king looked at the ruin, then at his son, and slowly he understood. Release the queen, he commanded the guards. Her imprisonment was unjust. She returned as pale and silent as before, and her spinning wheel was found whole in her chamber. The king declared before all, My son saw the truth when we were blind; he shall rule after me. And he arranged a marriage for the prince with the daughter of a great king from a neighbouring land. So the prince prepared for his wedding, and the kingdom slowly recovered from its ruined ambition.
