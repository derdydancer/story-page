The Sundered Kingdom and the Queen's Shadow P1
Once upon a time, in a kingdom blessed with sunshine, there dwelt a King.
He had a beautiful Queen, and they lived together in the royal palace.
They also had two sons, the thoughtful older Prince and the quiet younger Prince.
The kingdom flourished under his hand, bathed in a gentle light from the sky.
Life seemed peaceful for all who lived within its borders, and laughter was often heard.
Yet, though the Queen was fair and kind, a shadow lay upon her heart that none could see.
The King, who loved his Queen, sometimes saw a change in her eyes, a dimming of their usual light.
When he asked if aught was amiss, she would smile and say, "It is nothing, my lord, merely a passing cloud."
Her two sons also sensed a quietness in their mother at times, but they did not understand its source.
So the shadow remained within the Queen, unseen by most, a small thing then, but it was there.
As days turned into weeks, the Queen tried to laugh and speak as she once had done.
But she walked alone more often in the palace gardens, and her smiles did not always reach her eyes.
The King watched her from afar sometimes, and a growing weight settled upon his own spirit.
One evening, he took her hand and asked gently, "My Queen, what truly troubles you? Prithee, lift the veil from your heart."
She looked away from his earnest gaze and replied, "It is only a deep weariness, my King, that a night's rest does not seem to cure."
The King nodded slowly, though his heart felt no lighter for her words.
In the royal court, too, lords and ladies began to notice the Queen's quiet demeanor and infrequent laughter.
Her sons often brought her flowers from the garden or simply sat near her, watching her with solemn eyes.
She would thank them with a gentle smile, but the sadness lingered in the lines around her mouth.
So the unseen burden in the Queen's heart did not lessen but seemed to deepen its hold with each passing moon.
When the next season arrived, and the Queen's pallor had not improved, the King summoned the wisest physicians in the land.
They came to the palace and felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and asked her many questions about her humours.
The Queen answered them quietly, but she spoke little of the shadow that truly weighed upon her.
So the physicians consulted amongst themselves for many hours, but they could find no cause for her lingering sadness, nor any certain cure.
They went to the King at last and said, "Your Majesty, we find no bodily ill that our arts can touch; her malady seems to lie deeper."
The King heard their words and dismissed them with a heavy sigh, his brow furrowed with greater worry than before.
After the physicians departed, the Queen spoke even less, and often she would sit by the window, gazing out at the distant horizon.
A quiet gloom began to settle over the sunlit halls of the palace, and music was played less often.
The two Princes watched their mother with troubled hearts, for they loved her dearly but knew not the cause of her persistent sadness.
So the Queen remained alone with her shadow, and the King felt a growing fear that no earthly remedy could reach her.
One day, while the Queen sat listlessly in her chambers, an old serving woman approached her with a hesitant air.
The old woman curtsied low and said, "Your Majesty, forgive my boldness, but I have heard whispers of a powerful magic across the great sea, a magic that might lift such shadows from the heart."
The Queen looked up, and for the first time in many months, a flicker of light entered her eyes.
"Tell me more of this magic," she commanded softly, her voice still weak but now holding a thread of urgency.
The old woman spoke of a desolate shore where a black tower stood, and within it dwelt a solitary Sorcerer of great but hidden power.
"It is said this Sorcerer can mend hearts that are broken or lay spirits to rest that are troubled by unseen woes," the old woman continued.
The Queen listened to every word, and then she fell silent for a long time, her gaze fixed on that distant hope.
At last, she looked at the old woman and said, "If such a chance exists, no matter how remote, I must seek this Sorcerer."
The old serving woman bowed her head and whispered, "May your journey bring you the peace you seek, Your Majesty."
So, with a newfound resolve stirring in her weary heart, the Queen determined to speak to the King that very day about her desperate hope.
Later that evening, the Queen sought out the King, and she found him in his study, reading by candlelight.
The King looked up and saw that though she was still pale, there was an unwonted light in her eyes.
"My Queen," he said, setting aside his book, "you have something you wish to tell me."
The Queen came closer and said, "My lord, you know the strange shadow that chills my spirit and steals my joy."
"Today I learned of a possible remedy, a difficult path perhaps, but one I feel I must take. Prithee, grant me leave to journey across the sea, to seek a cure that may set my spirit free."
The King's heart was heavy to hear this, for he loved his Queen dearly and the thought of her departure pained him.
He looked at her earnest face and asked, "Across the sea? That is a long and perilous voyage. What is this cure you speak of?"
The Queen then told him of the old woman's tale, of the desolate shore, the black tower, and the Sorcerer who dwelt there, mending troubled spirits.
"I know it is far, my lord," she said, her voice trembling slightly, "but this shadow consumes me day by day. If there is any chance, I must take it."
The King looked at her for a long moment, his expression deeply troubled, and then he said he must consider such a grave matter.
All that night, the King paced the floors of his chambers, and he did not sleep.
He thought of his love for the Queen and her deep unhappiness, and then he thought of the dangers of the sea and unknown Sorcerers.
He considered their two young sons and how they would fare without their mother's presence for a long time.
The next morning, he watched the Queen as she moved through the palace, her eyes hollow save for that faint hope she now carried.
He remembered the words of the royal physicians, how they could find no earthly cause for her ailment.
Perhaps, he thought, this strange journey was indeed her only chance to find peace from the shadow that haunted her.
And because he loved her greatly, the thought of her continued suffering was more than he could bear.
He spoke then to his oldest and most trusted counsellor, who listened gravely and advised caution but acknowledged the Queen's visible pain.
By the afternoon, after much troubled thought and seeing the Queen's unwavering, desperate hope, the King's mind was set.
So, with a heavy heart but a clear resolve, he knew he must grant her wish for her sake, though it would bring him great sorrow.
That same evening, the King sent word for the Queen to attend him in the grand council chamber.
She came to him there, pale but composed, her eyes questioning and filled with a fragile hope.
The King looked upon her gently and said, "My Queen, I have considered your words and the great unhappiness that burdens you."
"Though it grieves me to part from you, and though my heart is filled with unease for such a journey, I grant your wish to seek this cure across the sea."
A small gasp escaped the Queen, and tears welled in her eyes, tears of relief and profound gratitude.
"Oh, my lord, my King," she whispered, sinking into a curtsy, "you have given me the greatest gift, the gift of hope."
The King raised her gently and said, "You shall have my finest ship, a loyal captain, and whatever companions you deem necessary for your comfort and safety."
A spark of her old vitality seemed to return to the Queen then, and she spoke of needing only a few trusted attendants and a swift departure.
Word soon spread through the palace that the Queen was to undertake a long sea voyage to seek a cure for her lingering illness.
So preparations began at once, yet a heavy air of anticipation and unspoken sorrow settled upon the royal household.
The sun rose on a grey morning a few days later, the appointed time for the Queen's ship to sail.
The Queen emerged from her chambers dressed in plain travelling clothes, her face pale but resolute.
Her two sons stood waiting for her, their young faces etched with worry, and she embraced each of them tightly.
"Be brave, my sons," she whispered, "and pray for my journey, that I may return to you well and whole."
Then she turned to the King, who stood watching with a heavy heart, and they looked at each other for a long moment without words.
The King took her hand and said softly, "Go with my blessing, Anna. May you find the peace you seek, and return swiftly to us."
With a final nod, the Queen turned and walked towards the waiting ship, her attendants following somberly behind her.
The King and his two sons stood upon the shore and watched as the ship's sails caught the wind and carried her away across the grey waters.
They watched until the ship was but a speck on the horizon, and then they turned back towards the palace with troubled hearts.
And so, Queen Anna departed from the kingdom, leaving behind her husband and sons, and a shadow of uncertainty fell upon the once bright land.
