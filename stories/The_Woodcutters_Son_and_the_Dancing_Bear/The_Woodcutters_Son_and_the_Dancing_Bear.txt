The Woodcutter's Son and the Dancing Bear
There was once a poor woodcutter's son, who was almost a man. One morning, his father said to him: "My son, today you shall carry my finest axe and newest whetstone to your grandfather." He is old and his hands tremble, and he needs these sharp tools to carve the yule-goat for the midwinter feast." The woodcutter's son took the axe and the whetstone with care. "Go straight to his cottage," his father said, "and do not stop if you hear music or see a crowd, for there is word of a travelling showman with a dancing bear in these parts, and such sights can make a young man forget his purpose and lose his father's tools." The son promised he would not stop for any showman. The grandfather dwelt deep in the forest, an hour's walk from their own small cottage. So the woodcutter's son set off with the axe on his shoulder and the whetstone in his pouch. He had not gone far into the trees when he heard loud music and the cheering of a crowd. Though he remembered his father's words, his feet slowed, and curiosity pulled him towards the sound.
In a clearing, a brightly dressed man played a pipe, and a great muzzled bear stood on its hind legs and danced clumsily as the villagers clapped. The showman's sharp eyes spotted the woodcutter's son and the fine axe upon his shoulder. "Greetings, young master!" called the showman. "Surely a strong young fellow like you has time to enjoy the wonders of my famous dancing bear?" The son, forgetting his promise for a moment, replied, "It is a strong bear indeed." "Strongest in seven counties!" the showman declared, "but I wager even your fine axe could not mark the ancient oak at the clearing's edge with a single blow, as my bear can with his paw!" The son's pride was stirred, for he knew his father's axe was sharp, and he said, "My axe can mark any tree!" "Then prove it!" laughed the showman. "Strike that great oak yonder. If your axe fails to bite deep with one swing, it is mine. If it succeeds, this silver coin is yours!" The woodcutter's son, eager to show the axe's worth, hefted it, all thought of his grandfather and the yule-goat gone from his mind. He swung the fine axe with all his might at the ancient oak, but just as he swung, the showman shouted, "Look, the bear dances anew!" and the youth's eye flickered, causing the axe to strike only a glancing blow. "A poor stroke indeed!" cried the showman, snatching the axe. "The axe is mine by right of the wager!"
The woodcutter's son stood silent, the axe gone, and only the heavy whetstone remaining in his pouch. The showman, wasting no time, packed his few things, gave a tug to the bear's chain, and led it away into the forest. The villagers too departed, laughing and talking, each to their own tasks, leaving the youth alone. Then the woodcutter's son remembered his grandfather waiting for the axe, and the yule-goat that might not be carved. His face grew hot with shame at the thought of his father's disappointment. He knew he could not go home thus, so he resolved to find the showman and get the axe back, though he knew not how. He looked to the path the showman had taken deeper into the woods, and began to walk. The forest grew darker as evening came, and the path was hard to see. Soon, he was lost, with only the whetstone in his pouch for comfort. At last, when he was weary from walking and the moon was hidden by clouds, he stumbled upon a tiny hut nestled between two ancient pines.
A sliver of light shone from beneath its crooked door. The woodcutter's son, having no other recourse, went to the door and knocked softly. The door creaked open, and an old woman with eyes as keen as a hawk's peered out. "What brings a youth to my doorstep at this dark hour?" she asked, her voice like rustling leaves. The son told her of the showman, the dancing bear, and the wager that had cost him his father's axe. "Ah, the showman with the sad bear," the old woman nodded. "He is a cunning thief who preys on the pride of young men and the boredom of villagers." "The axe he will not give up easily," she said, "but perhaps there is a way. You still have the whetstone, do you not?" The son brought forth the whetstone and said, "I do, and I will use it to sharpen any tool you have if you can help me." "Good," she replied, and fetched from a dark corner an old carving knife, as dull as a river stone. "Sharpen this by morning so it can split a hair floating on water, and I will tell you how to find the showman and trick the trickster." The woodcutter's son, though daunted by the task, took the dull knife and the whetstone, and began to work by the faint light of her single candle.
All through the night he worked, the whetstone rasped against the old steel, and small sparks flew in the dim light. When the first light of dawn touched the window, the old knife was gleaming, and its edge was so fine it seemed to vanish. The old woman took it, plucked a hair from her head, laid it on a bowl of water, and with a soft touch, the knife split it cleanly down its length. "You have done well," she said. "Now, for your reward: the showman rests at noon by the Three Sisters waterfall, a half day's journey south. When his bear is tethered and he sleeps, take this very knife, and with one swift cut, sever the leather strap of the bear's muzzle, but do not harm the bear." "The bear, tasting freedom from its torment, will cause such a commotion that the showman will be distracted, and you may reclaim your axe in the confusion." The woodcutter's son thanked the old woman, took the gleaming knife, and set off with renewed hope. He found the showman sleeping by the waterfall, the great bear tethered to a tree nearby, its muzzle tight. Quiet as a mouse, the son crept forward, and with one silent stroke of the old woman's knife, he cut the thick leather strap of the bear's muzzle. The bear, feeling the muzzle loosen, gave a great roar, and tore at its tether, while the showman woke in terror at the sudden fury. Amid the showman's shouts and the bear's rampage, the woodcutter's son swiftly snatched his axe from where it lay, retrieved his own whetstone from the showman's discarded bag, and fled back towards his grandfather's cottage, not once looking back.
