var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "Introduces the protagonist as a youth on the cusp of responsibility, setting a slightly different tone than a 'sweet little girl'.", "Grimm Style": "Starts with a classic 'There was once a...' formula. Uses a generic descriptor 'a poor woodcutter's son' instead of a name. Simple, declarative sentence. Adheres to 'Beginning the Story' Do's: simple character introduction.", "Moral Implication": "Establishes a humble background, often a precursor to a character being tested or needing to prove their worth. 'Almost a man' hints at an upcoming trial or rite of passage.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The protagonist is at a transitional stage (Ego development), moving from childhood towards adult responsibilities. His father's profession (woodcutter) connects him to the forest, a place of trial.", "Sentence": "There was once a poor woodcutter's son, who was almost a man.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "The father, an authority figure, gives the son his first significant adult task, signifying a transfer or test of responsibility.", "Grimm Style": "Simple sentence structure. 'One morning' is a standard temporal marker. Dialogue is direct and functional. The task involves carrying tools, concrete objects. Consistent with 'Dialogue' Do's.", "Moral Implication": "The task is a test of the son's capability and trustworthiness. It's his first foray into a more adult role. The tools symbolize work and skill.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Father archetype (Superego/societal expectation) initiates the son (Ego) into a task. The 'finest axe and newest whetstone' are not just tools but symbols of heritage, skill, and responsibility being passed on or tested.", "Sentence": "One morning, his father said to him: \"My son, today you shall carry my finest axe and newest whetstone to your grandfather.\"", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Explains the reason for the task: the grandfather's failing strength and the need for the tools for an important purpose (crafting a special gift).", "Grimm Style": "Compound sentence within dialogue. Explains the situation with functional adjectives ('old and his hands tremble'). The purpose ('carve the yule-goat') is a specific, culturally resonant task. Simple conjunctions.", "Moral Implication": "Emphasizes filial duty, respect for elders, and the continuation of tradition (yule-goat). The son's reliability is crucial for this important family/community custom.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Grandfather represents wisdom, tradition, or the fading older generation. His trembling hands signify vulnerability. The yule-goat is a symbolic object, perhaps representing community well-being or seasonal renewal, which the son now has a role in ensuring through his errand.", "Sentence": "He is old and his hands tremble, and he needs these sharp tools to carve the yule-goat for the midwinter feast.\"", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "The son accepts the task and the responsibility for the valuable items.", "Grimm Style": "Simple, declarative sentence. Direct action and acceptance. 'Took the axe and whetstone with care' shows his initial seriousness. Consistent with characters defined by actions.", "Moral Implication": "Shows initial good intent and understanding of the responsibility. The 'care' indicates respect for the tools and the task.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego accepts the responsibility and the symbolic tools. His 'care' reflects a conscious commitment to the task given by the Father archetype.", "Sentence": "The woodcutter's son took the axe and the whetstone with care.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 4}, {"Plot Function": "The father gives a crucial warning, different from 'don't leave the path', focusing on the dangers of distraction by worldly spectacle or performance, and the specific risk of losing the tools.", "Grimm Style": "Compound sentence with a direct warning. The danger is specific ('a travelling showman with a dancing bear') and the consequence is losing the tools. This sets up a different kind of temptation than in R.R.H. Consistent with clear warnings of negative consequences.", "Moral Implication": "The warning is about being sidetracked by trivial entertainment or impressive displays, and neglecting one's duty, leading to the loss of valuable, functional items. This hints at a male vulnerability to being impressed by spectacle or perhaps competitive displays.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The warning is against being lured by superficial spectacle (the 'dancing bear' as a manufactured, perhaps deceptive, display of power or entertainment) which could lead to the loss of genuine tools of craft and responsibility (axe and whetstone \u2013 symbols of true skill and purpose). This is a temptation of distraction from one's path of duty.", "Sentence": "\"Go straight to his cottage,\" his father said, \"and do not stop if you hear music or see a crowd, for there is word of a travelling showman with a dancing bear in these parts, and such sights can make a young man forget his purpose and lose his father's tools.\"", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "The son promises obedience, setting up the potential for this promise to be tested.", "Grimm Style": "Simple declarative sentence. 'The son promised he would not stop' is a direct commitment. Key for the moral structure based on obedience.", "Moral Implication": "Establishes his intention to follow the father's wise counsel, making any later deviation a clear transgression.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego verbally commits to the Superego's directive, setting a conscious intention to resist the specific temptation outlined.", "Sentence": "The son promised he would not stop for any showman.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 6}, {"Plot Function": "Establishes the setting for the journey \u2013 the grandfather's dwelling is isolated within the forest, a place of potential encounters.", "Grimm Style": "Simple sentence. 'The grandfather dwelt deep in the forest' uses archetypal setting. 'An hour's walk' gives a sense of distance. 'Dwelt' is an archaic term. Conforms to 'Describing Setting' Do's.", "Moral Implication": "The forest setting implies a journey through an untamed, potentially hazardous space where resolve can be tested. The grandfather's isolation makes the timely delivery of the tools more important.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'deep forest' represents the unconscious, a place of trial and encounter with unknown elements. The grandfather living there suggests he is connected to this primal nature or requires the youth to brave it for connection/tradition.", "Sentence": "The grandfather dwelt deep in the forest, an hour's walk from their own small cottage.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 7}, {"Plot Function": "The son begins his journey, carrying the symbols of his responsibility.", "Grimm Style": "Simple sentence. 'Set off with the axe on his shoulder and the whetstone in his pouch' describes his action and the items he carries concretely. Active voice.", "Moral Implication": "He begins his task in earnest, properly equipped. His journey is one of duty.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego embarks on the journey into the unconscious, bearing the tools/symbols of responsibility and purpose. The axe (action, cutting through obstacles) and whetstone (maintaining sharpness/skill) are significant.", "Sentence": "So the woodcutter's son set off with the axe on his shoulder and the whetstone in his pouch.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 8}, {"Plot Function": "The inciting incident: the protagonist encounters the forewarned temptation \u2013 the showman and his bear.", "Grimm Style": "Compound sentence. 'He had not gone far when he heard...' builds anticipation. The 'showman' and 'dancing bear' are introduced as predicted. Simple descriptive language ('loud music,' 'cheering of a crowd').", "Moral Implication": "The test arrives quickly. The allure of entertainment and spectacle is presented as a direct challenge to his promise and duty.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego encounters the predicted temptation \u2013 a manufactured spectacle ('dancing bear') designed to captivate and distract. This is the 'wolf' figure in a different guise, appealing not to innocence but perhaps to curiosity, a desire for novelty, or social excitement (the crowd).", "Sentence": "He had not gone far into the trees when he heard loud music and the cheering of a crowd.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 9}, {"Plot Function": "Despite his promise, the son is drawn to investigate the source of the commotion, showing his first wavering.", "Grimm Style": "Simple sentence. 'His feet slowed' shows his hesitation and inner conflict physically. 'Curiosity pulled him' is a simple personification of his impulse. Direct and factual. This avoids stating his inner state explicitly while showing it through action.", "Moral Implication": "The first sign of weakness or yielding to temptation.

Hope is restored through effort and guidance.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego, having successfully completed the trial set by the Wise Old Woman and received her wisdom and a potent tool (the perfected knife), proceeds with renewed purpose and a viable plan to confront the Deceiver and reclaim what was lost.", "Sentence": "The woodcutter's son thanked the old woman, took the gleaming knife, and set off with renewed hope.", "Chapter Number": 5, "Sentence Number": 46}, {"Plot Function": "He finds the showman and the bear as predicted, setting the stage for him to enact the plan.", "Grimm Style": "Simple sentence. 'Just as the old woman had said' confirms her wisdom. The scene is as described (showman sleeping, bear tethered). Builds tension for the critical action.", "Moral Implication": "The wisdom of the elder proves true. The opportunity to act is presented clearly.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego finds the Deceiver in a vulnerable state (sleeping), and the subdued primal power (bear) tethered, just as the Wise Old Woman predicted. This confirms the validity of her insight.", "Sentence": "He found the showman sleeping by the waterfall, the great bear tethered to a tree nearby, its muzzle tight.", "Chapter Number": 5, "Sentence Number": 47}, {"Plot Function": "The son successfully and precisely cuts the bear's muzzle strap with the magically sharp knife.", "Grimm Style": "Compound sentence. His approach is 'quiet as a mouse'. The action of cutting the strap is swift and clean ('one silent stroke'). The knife's quality is emphasized. Direct, precise action.", "Moral Implication": "He executes the plan with skill and courage. The quality of the knife, earned through his labor, is crucial to this precise and risky action. He is undoing the showman's cruel control.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego, using the perfectly honed tool (knife/skill/clarity), performs the liberating act. Cutting the 'muzzle strap' frees the subdued primal power from its artificial constraint. This is a precise and almost surgical intervention.", "Sentence": "Quiet as a mouse, the son crept forward, and with one silent stroke of the old woman's knife, he cut the thick leather strap of the bear's muzzle.", "Chapter Number": 5, "Sentence Number": 48}, {"Plot Function": "The freed bear reacts powerfully, creating the diversion, and the showman is terrified.", "Grimm Style": "Compound sentence. The bear's reaction is immediate and wild ('great roar,' 'tore at its tether'). The showman's reaction ('woke in terror') is a direct consequence. Vivid, action-filled description.", "Moral Implication": "The natural power of the bear, once freed from cruel restraint, is immense. The trickster is now the one terrified and overwhelmed by a force he sought to control for profit.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The liberated primal power (bear) erupts, causing chaos and terrifying the Deceiver, who loses control of the situation. This demonstrates the uncontrollable nature of such energies once unleashed from artificial suppression.", "Sentence": "The bear, feeling the muzzle loosen, gave a great roar, and tore at its tether, while the showman woke in terror at the sudden fury.", "Chapter Number": 5, "Sentence Number": 49}, {"Plot Function": "In the ensuing chaos, the son reclaims his axe and also takes the whetstone, then departs, having learned his lesson and righted his wrong, leaving the trickster to his fate.", "Grimm Style": "Compound-complex sentence. 'Amid the showman's shouts and the bear's rampage' sets the chaotic scene. The son reclaims his axe AND the whetstone (implying he'd left it with the old woman or it was part of the wager symbolically). He 'did not look back,' showing his resolve to return to his duty. A satisfying resolution to his quest.", "Moral Implication": "The son successfully reclaims his property and, by implication, his honor. He wisely leaves the scene of chaos, not getting further involved. The trickster is left to deal with the consequences of his own cruelty (the freed bear). The son has learned a valuable lesson about responsibility, temptation, and the value of hard work.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "In the chaos created by the unleashed primal energy, the Ego reclaims its tool of purpose (axe) and its potential (whetstone). He has overcome the Deceiver not by direct brute force, but through wisdom, patience, skill, and by strategically liberating another force. He leaves the Deceiver to contend with the now-uncontrolled primal energy, having restored his own agency and learned a crucial lesson in his individuation journey.", "Sentence": "Amid the showman's shouts and the bear's rampage, the woodcutter's son swiftly snatched his axe from where it lay, retrieved his own whetstone from the showman's discarded bag, and fled back towards his grandfather's cottage, not once looking back.", "Chapter Number": 5, "Sentence Number": 50}];
