The Ungrateful Serpent
A farmer was walking home through the snow one cold winter evening when he saw something dark lying by the path. He drew near and found it was a serpent, stiff and frozen with the cold. The farmer had a kind heart, and though he knew serpents could be dangerous, he pitied the creature. ‘Poor thing,’ he said, ‘I cannot leave you here to die.’
He carefully picked up the frozen serpent, opened his thick coat, and placed the creature inside against his own warm body. He fastened his coat again and hurried home.
When he reached his cottage, he went straight to the hearth where a bright fire burned. He gently laid the serpent on the warm stones before the fire. His wife saw this and cried out, ‘Husband, what are you doing? That is a dangerous beast!’
‘It was freezing to death,’ said the farmer. ‘Let it warm itself; perhaps kindness will tame it.’
They watched as the serpent slowly began to thaw. It stirred, uncoiled itself, and lifted its head, its little eyes glittering in the firelight. Seeing the farmer and his wife, it suddenly hissed, opened its jaws wide, and lunged forward to bite the farmer’s hand – the very hand that had saved it.
The farmer, quick from years of farm work, snatched up the heavy iron poker from the hearth and struck the serpent dead with a single blow.
‘Alas,’ he said sadly to his wife, ‘some natures are so evil that no amount of kindness can change them. I learned a hard lesson this night.’
