The Foolish Youth and the Princess of Glass
There was once a youth whom all the village called a great fool. He once tried to catch fish in the river with a birdcage. Of course, he caught nothing, and only sat by the water till nightfall. His mother wept much to see him so, but his father, a poor woodcutter, said, 'You are grown now, and must seek your fortune in the wide world.' The youth, who knew no better, agreed at once. His mother gave him a dry crust of bread and a wooden flask of water, and his father gave him a single copper coin. So he set out on the road, whistling a merry tune, for he was not troubled by much thinking. After walking for half a day, he came to a place where the road divided; one path looked easy and sunny, but the other path looked dark and stony. 'The dark path will surely dirty my shoes,' thought the youth, for his mother had polished them before he left, 'so I shall take the sunny one.' But the sunny path had a hidden hole full of mud, and into this he tumbled head over heels.
He climbed out, covered in mud from top to toe, and saw an old woman sitting by the roadside, laughing at him. 'Well now, young master,' said she, 'some choose their path by sense, and some by shine.' 'My shoes were shiny,' answered the youth, 'but now they are all spoilt.' The old woman chuckled and said, 'Perhaps this will help your shine; take this dull grey pebble, and keep it in your pocket.' The youth, not knowing any better, took the pebble and put it in his empty pocket with his single copper coin. 'Look at it when the moon is hungry,' she cackled, and then she was gone, as if the wind had swept her away. The youth walked on till evening, and the moon was but a sliver in the dark sky, like a paring from a giant's nail. He remembered the old woman's words, took out the pebble, and looked at it. As he looked, the dull grey pebble began to glow, and then it shone like a little star in his hand, casting a bright light on the path before him. And in that light, he saw that the path, which had seemed to go nowhere, now led straight to a little hut he had not seen before.
The youth, holding the shining pebble, walked to the hut and knocked on its crooked door. The door creaked open, and a very old miller with a beard as white as flour and nearly as long as his arm stood there. 'Well now, what do you want here, boy, at this late hour?' asked the miller, his voice like the rumbling of his own millstones. 'I am lost and hungry,' said the youth, 'and my pebble showed me your light.' The miller looked at the shining pebble with sharp eyes and said, 'You may have shelter and a crust, but only if you agree to sift my flour for three days, for my old bones ache.' 'I will do it gladly,' said the youth, for he was indeed very hungry. So the miller let him in, and the youth set to work with such vigour that he soon tripped over his own feet and sent a whole sack of fine flour billowing into the air like a white cloud. The miller, instead of growing angry, only stroked his long beard and said, 'Well, that is one way to dust the rafters.' The youth, thinking this was praise, then grabbed a broom and began to sweep the flour from the floor, sending even more of it into every crack and crevice of the hut. By the time night fell, the hut was whiter than snow inside, and the youth was given a meal of thin porridge and a pile of straw to sleep on.
The next morning, the miller again set the youth to the task of sifting flour. 'This time,' thought the youth, 'I shall be careful not to spill it upwards,' so he decided to carry the next sack of grain to the sifter balanced upon his head. But as he walked very slowly, a nanny-goat belonging to the miller, thinking his head was a new sort of manger, butted him from behind, and the whole sack fell to the ground and burst open. The miller, who was watching from the doorway, said, 'Well, at least the goats will eat well today.' The youth, hearing this, thought the miller wanted the goat to help, so he spent the next hour trying to show the nanny-goat how to hold the sieve with its horns. At this, the miller's daughter, a comely and quick-witted maiden who had been watching from the window, could not help but laugh aloud. The youth heard her laughter and stopped his work with the goat, looking quite bewildered. 'Good sir,' she called out, trying to hide her mirth, 'do you think the goat has hands for such work, or that it fancies dusty flour for its dinner?' 'But the miller seemed pleased that the goat would eat,' the youth replied, scratching his head. That evening, after much wasted grain, the miller's daughter secretly gave the youth a larger piece of bread with his thin porridge.
On the third day, the youth approached the sacks of grain with a heavy sigh. 'Perhaps,' he thought, 'if I take only a very little flour at a time, I will not spill it.' So he decided to use his cap to carry the flour to the sifter. This was slow work, and as his cap was full of sweat and dust from his journey, the little flour he did manage to sift was not as white as it should have been. The miller's daughter, seeing this, finally came down from the window, took a proper scoop, and in a short while, had sifted a good pile of clean flour herself. The youth watched her with wide eyes, his mouth agape. When the miller came at the end of the third day, he saw the neat pile of sifted flour. 'You are a strange worker,' said the miller to the youth, 'but the flour is sifted. You may stay on as a helper in the mill, if you wish, and learn a thing or two.' The youth, who had nowhere else to go and was rather taken with the miller's kind daughter, agreed to stay. And so the youth stayed at the mill, and though he was clumsy at first, the miller's daughter patiently showed him how to do many tasks. He learned slowly how to mend sacks, grease the water wheel, and even to tell good grain from bad, so that in time, he was no longer a great fool, but perhaps only a middling one.
One day, a King's herald rode through the village by the mill, proclaiming a decree. The King's only daughter, the Princess, had fallen under a strange sickness that made her skin turn to brittle glass, and she would shatter at the slightest touch. Whosoever could cure her would win her hand in marriage and half the kingdom. The youth heard this, and though he knew little of cures, he thought of the kind miller's daughter and declared, 'I will go and try to cure the Princess!' The old miller scoffed, saying, 'You, cure the Princess? You'll sooner turn water into wine!' But the miller's daughter looked at the youth with a strange expression and said nothing. As the youth made ready to leave, with only his shining pebble and the clothes on his back, the miller's daughter came to him secretly and pressed a small, tightly-sewn linen pouch into his hand. 'Open this only when all seems brittle and lost,' she whispered, 'and use what is inside with the softest touch you possess.' The youth journeyed to the King's castle, and after many days, because so many great physicians and wise men had already failed and departed, he was allowed to see the Princess who lay upon a bed of swan's down, looking like a statue of clear ice. Seeing her so fragile, the youth remembered the miller's daughter's words and carefully opened the linen pouch. Inside, there was not a glittering jewel nor a magic herb, but a handful of the softest lamb's wool, and a tiny, sharp needle made of fishbone, along with a thread spun from spider silk.
Hardly daring to breathe, the youth took the fishbone needle, threaded it with the spider silk, and using the lamb's wool as the gentlest of swabs, he began to work on the Princess's glass-like hand, where a tiny, almost invisible crack had appeared. For three days and three nights he toiled, finding and mending one tiny flaw after another with the spider silk, each stitch a breath held, each movement a prayer against shattering. The King and all his court watched from a distance, silent and fearful, for no one else had dared even to touch the Princess. At the dawn of the fourth day, as the youth tied off the last invisible stitch made of spider silk, a faint warmth returned to the Princess's cheeks, and her skin, though still like glass, seemed stronger, less terrifyingly brittle. Then she opened her eyes, which were clear as a summer sky, and said, 'I feel as though I could dance without breaking!' The King wept with joy and embraced the youth, declaring him the truest physician in the land. 'You have won my daughter's hand and half my kingdom, as was promised,' said the King. The youth bowed low and said, 'I will gladly marry the Princess, if she will have me, but first, I must fetch the good miller and his wise daughter, for it was her gift that showed me the way.' And so the miller and his daughter were brought to the court with great ceremony, and they were given riches and honored throughout the land. Then the youth married the Princess, and in time, he became King, and they ruled wisely and well for many years, for he never forgot the days when he was a fool, nor the kindness of a soft touch when all seemed lost.
