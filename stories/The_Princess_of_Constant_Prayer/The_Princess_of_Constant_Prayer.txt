The Princess of Constant Prayer
Once upon a time, there was a princess in a quiet kingdom, and she was known above all for her chastity and her constant prayers to God. Her father, the king, fell gravely ill, and no physician in the land could find a cure for his ailment. The princess doubled her prayers, and spent many hours each day on her knees before the altar in the royal chapel. Then one day, a gaunt man arrived at the palace from a distant land, claiming he knew a cure for the king's malady. But for this cure, he demanded a strange and terrible price: the hand of the princess in marriage. The king, hearing this from his sickbed, grew very pale but did not refuse outright, so great was his suffering. The princess asked for a day to consider the matter, and she went straight to the chapel, where she prayed for many hours. It was said that after her prayers, a certain course of action became clear to her, though she spoke of it to no one. The next morning, the princess announced to the court that she would marry the gaunt man if he cured her father. The gaunt man gave the king a dark potion; the king drank it, and by evening his strength began to return, and all the kingdom rejoiced greatly.
The day for the wedding was set, and the princess dressed in simple white, and prayed without ceasing for God's protection. The gaunt man stood beside her at the altar, looking more gaunt and grim than ever, and he spoke no word throughout the ceremony. No sooner were they wed than the gaunt man led her from the palace to a chariot drawn by black horses, and they rode for many days to a distant, desolate castle. The castle was made of bare stone, with many empty rooms, and the gaunt man never spoke to her, nor were there any servants to attend her. She was given little food, a crust of bread and water each day, and slept on the hard floor, but still she prayed to God for strength. One morning, the gaunt man entered her room, pointed to a tiny brush made of three hairs, and then to the vast, filthy stables of the castle. The princess prayed for guidance, then took the tiny brush and went to the stables, beginning the hopeless task. She toiled all day, making almost no mark, but when the gaunt man came to inspect at evening, the stables were entirely spotless, though she knew not how. The gaunt man showed no surprise but the next day gave her a mountain of mixed black and white feathers in the courtyard and gestured that she must sort them by nightfall, though a great wind had begun to blow. Again the princess prayed, and as she began to pick at the swirling feathers, a flock of white doves and black crows descended, swiftly sorting them into two perfect mounds before vanishing as the sun set.
The gaunt man still said nothing, but on the third day, he led her to a deep well and handed her a sieve, indicating she must empty it by dark. For a moment, the princess's shoulders drooped, but then she straightened, knelt by the well, and began to pray with all her heart. As she prayed, it seemed a voice whispered to her to line the sieve with moss and clay from the well's edge, which she did. To her astonishment, the sieve now held water, and tirelessly she drew water, pail after pail, until the deep well was entirely dry by sunset. When the gaunt man saw the empty well, his eyes gleamed with a cold light, and for the first time, he spoke, his voice like dry leaves rustling: "You are more resourceful than I thought." That night, he led her not to her usual bare room, but to the innermost part of the castle, before a heavy iron door she had not seen before. He produced an ancient key, unlocked the door, and said, "Tonight you will keep company with the castle's oldest guest. We shall see if your God protects your chastity now." Then he thrust her inside into utter darkness, and she heard a low growl before the door slammed and was locked, and a great, shaggy form with glowing red eyes began to move towards her. The princess fell to her knees upon the cold stone, not screaming, but praying aloud with all the fervour of her soul as the beast drew nearer. As her words filled the darkness, the monstrous beast paused, then slowly, it crept forward and laid its great, fearsome head gently in her lap, and became as calm as a lamb.
When the gaunt man opened the door in the morning, expecting to find only bones, he stood visibly confounded, for the princess sat calmly stroking the now peaceful beast. Without a word, he seized her arm, dragged her from the castle and from the now whimpering beast, and after a long journey, abandoned her on a wild, barren moor with no food or shelter. The princess, with her clothes tattered and her feet bare, knelt on the cold earth and prayed for God's mercy and guidance. As she prayed, a small loaf of white bread appeared on a flat stone before her, and a little spring of fresh water bubbled up from the ground nearby. For a long time she lived thus, praying each day, and each day finding just enough food and water to sustain her. One day, as she gathered berries, a band of cruel robbers burst from a thicket of gorse, their faces rough and their eyes glinting with malice. They seized her, bound her hands with a rough rope, and their leader, a burly man with a scarred cheek, said, "This pretty thing will fetch a good price at the slave market, or perhaps a ransom from some noble fool." The princess did not weep nor plead, but held her head high and prayed silently to God as they dragged her towards their hidden camp. As they neared the camp, a very large and remarkably fierce badger suddenly shot out from its sett, hissing and snapping, and charged directly into the legs of the robber captain. In the ensuing confusion, with robbers shouting and swatting at the furious badger, the princess managed to slip her bonds and flee unnoticed into the dense forest.
She ran for many hours, until she was deep within a dark and tangled forest, the likes of which she had never seen. Weariness overcame her, and she sank down at the foot of an ancient oak, and prayed to God for a safe refuge. As the last words left her lips, her eyes opened, and before her stood a small, ramshackle hut made of branches and mud, which she was certain had not been there moments before. Hesitantly, the princess approached the hut, and from within emerged a hideous old woman, with one gleaming red eye in the centre of her forehead, a long crooked nose, and a single black tooth in her mouth. The princess, though her heart trembled, curtsied and asked for shelter, and the old woman replied in a rasping voice, "You may stay, if you agree to be my servant and do all I bid without question." Having prayed for a sign and receiving none to the contrary, the princess agreed to the old woman's terms, thanking God for this harsh mercy. Her tasks were endless and vile: scrubbing grimy floors with her bare hands, tending a perpetually smoky fire, gathering bitter herbs from a poisoned marsh, and spinning coarse, thorny flax into thread, while the old woman watched and cackled, never pleased. Yet the princess did all that was asked without complaint, and each night, when her work was done, she would find a quiet corner to pray for deliverance. One day, the old woman pointed to a great black raven perched on the crumbling chimney, which spoke with a man's voice, and said, "Each sunrise, you must feed this bird three red berries from my thorn-guarded bush, and you must do so in absolute silence; if you speak a single word to it, or about it, you will suffer a fate worse than any you have known." So each dawn, the princess carefully plucked three blood-red berries from the viciously thorned bush behind the hut, approached the talking raven in silence, and fed it as instructed, while the bird fixed her with its intelligent, unblinking eyes.
Many weeks passed in this manner, and the princess spoke no word, until one morning, after she had fed the raven its berries, it looked at her intently and let fall a single, jet-black feather at her feet before flying off. The princess, still in silence, bent and picked up the feather, tucking it carefully into the worn bodice of her dress. From the shadowed doorway of the hut, the old woman with the one red eye watched this, and her eye narrowed, though she said nothing. That night, as the princess lay on her rough pallet, she felt a strange warmth spreading from where she had hidden the feather, and a gentle throbbing against her skin. Then, to her utter astonishment, she heard the raven's voice, not from the chimney, but clear in her mind, saying, "Fear not, pure maiden, for your trials near their end." "I am no mere bird," the voice continued, "but a prince under a foul enchantment, and the one-eyed crone our cruel gaoler. Your silent service and purity have weakened her power over me." "Tomorrow, when she bids you stir her cauldron, take this feather, and for once speak. Utter the words 'By the power of one pure heart and a feather of night, let the unseen be seen, and darkness take flight!' Then cast the feather into her brew." The princess listened with wonder and a new resolve filled her; she clutched the feather tightly and prayed for strength for the coming dawn. At sunrise, the one-eyed crone, grumbling, pointed to her large, bubbling cauldron and croaked, "Stir the pot, lazy girl, and do not stop until I say, or you'll get no crumbs today!" The princess took the long ladle, but before stirring, she held forth the black feather and spoke clearly and firmly the words the raven had taught her, then cast the feather into the steaming brew.
A terrible shriek erupted from the one-eyed crone, the cauldron cracked with a sound like thunder, and the hut filled with acrid smoke, then vanished completely, leaving the princess standing in a sunlit glade. Where the raven had perched on the now-gone chimney, there now stood a handsome young prince, finely dressed, who smiled at the princess with gratitude in his eyes. "Pure maiden," he said, his voice now rich and clear, "you have broken my cruel enchantment and saved me. I offer you my hand in marriage, and you shall be queen of my prosperous kingdom." The princess, who had endured so much, curtsied low and replied, "Noble prince, it was God's grace that aided me. I humbly accept your most generous offer." So the prince led the princess from the forest, and they journeyed for three days until they reached his shining city, where the people were good and the lands fertile and green. There they were wed with great rejoicing, and all the land celebrated the wisdom and beauty of their new queen. News traveled to her father the king, who, now fully recovered, journeyed to his daughter's new kingdom and wept with joy to see her so honored and happy. As for the gaunt man who had been her first husband, it was learned that upon the very moment the raven prince's enchantment was broken, he himself had withered like a cursed weed and crumbled into dust in his desolate castle. The princess, now a beloved queen, never forgot her trials, and she ruled wisely and well, always keeping God in her prayers and showing great charity to the poor and afflicted. She and the prince lived happily to a great age, and their kingdom was blessed with peace and many children, who were taught the virtues of chastity, prayer, and perseverance.
