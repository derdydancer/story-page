The Skyward Fool and the Wolf’s Bargain
The king's son, deemed a great fool for his habit of talking to stones and feeding goats his breakfast, packed a sack of stale bread and declared he would find a princess to marry, though no one believed he could find his way out of a paper bag. In a dark forest, the fool met a wolf with eyes like smoldering coals, who asked, 'Why chase a princess when you can’t even count the crumbs in your beard?' The wolf explained that the sky fell every seven years, crushing those who stood still too long, and the fool laughed, thinking it a jest until a peach plummeted from the heavens and split a boulder in two. He ducked as the wolf dragged him aside, narrowly avoiding a rain of turnips that left the path behind them unrecognizable. The wolf added that a princess was now stranded on a cloud above the kingdom, her kingdom’s scholars too proud to admit they couldn’t pull her down. The fool, eager to outdo the scholars, shouted that he’d rescue her himself, though he didn’t know how to climb a beanstalk, let alone find one. The wolf, grinning, tossed him a bone that hummed like a compass and said, 'Follow its song, but remember—debts are paid in teeth.' The bone led him to a ladder of smoke that spiraled upward, and he climbed, his boots slipping on the vapor of forgotten prayers. Halfway up, a man in scholar’s robes fell past him, screaming, 'The sky doesn’t care how clever you are!' before vanishing into a puff of regret. The fool arrived at the cloud, which trembled like jelly underfoot, and found the princess clinging to a sparrow’s nest, her crown askew.
The princess sneered, 'You? A fool? I’d rather stay here until the sky swallows me whole,' and the cloud shuddered ominously. The wolf, now revealed as the scholar who’d fallen earlier, emerged from the mist and growled, 'You’re all doomed if you don’t listen to me.' The fool, torn between the princess’s distrust and the wolf’s urgency, juggled a pair of cloud-flakes and said, 'What’s the plan, then?' The wolf confessed he’d once stolen the sky’s secret to save his own life, and now the heavens punished him by making him a guide to those who would fail. The princess, refusing the wolf’s hand, stamped her foot and cried, 'I’ll not take orders from a beast!'—and the sky cracked like an egg overhead. The fool hurled his stale bread at the crack, and the sky’s hunger for crumbs paused its collapse long enough for the wolf to pull them into a hollow log. Inside the log, the wolf hissed, 'To fix this, you must offer the sky something it wants more than chaos—your laughter, your bread, or your bones.' The fool, after a long silence, nodded and said, 'Take the laughter. I’ve had enough of it anyway.' The wolf bit his shoulder, and the fool felt his joy drain into the wound, replaced by a cold, clear understanding of gravity. The cloud dissolved beneath them, and they plummeted toward a village where the sky lay lowest, brushing rooftops like a jealous lover.
They crashed into a village where the sky squashed chimneys flat, and the villagers, bent like question marks, muttered that the princess’s laughter had once kept it aloft. The princess gasped, 'I haven’t laughed since my father’s jester died,' and the sky groaned, pressing a baker into a pancake. The fool declared they must find the jester’s ghost and let the princess laugh again, and the wolf snorted, 'A fool’s errand, literally.' They trudged to a graveyard where the tombstones glowed like fireflies, and the jester’s ghost was said to dance on the thinnest hour of midnight. The jester’s ghost appeared, skeletal and grinning, and said, 'To wake my song, you must forget your own.' The fool agreed, and the jester’s ghost blew a trumpet of wind into his mouth, stealing his laughter and leaving a taste of iron. The ghost added, 'The sky fell when she stopped laughing, not when I died,' and vanished, leaving the princess pale as milk. The princess whispered, 'I was told laughter was unfit for a queen,' and a tear fell, which the wolf caught in a vial labeled 'Regret.' The wolf poured the tears onto the bone, which grew into a ladder to the sky’s underbelly, where stars pulsed like bruises. They climbed, the ladder creaking with the weight of their secrets, toward the sky’s ragged edge where the stars bled light.
At the top, they found a field of grass growing downward into clouds, and a tree with roots in the air, humming the wolf’s curse backward. The tree’s bark peeled into words: 'The sky fell because the princess forgot how to laugh, and the fool forgot how to be silent.' The fool scratched his head, now heavier with knowledge, and muttered, 'How do you make someone laugh when the world’s ending?' The wolf’s voice snarled from the bone, 'Tell a joke about the fool who thought he could be a hero,' and the fool punched him in the nose. The princess gripped his hand and said, 'If you’re going, I’ll be your assistant. Even a fool deserves a crown.' The sky roared, 'Tell a joke about the fool who lost his laughter!' and the fool grinned, 'He married a princess and found out the real joke was the wolf’s nose.' The sky burst into laughter so loud it blew the ladder to splinters, but the fool and princess clung to each other, falling upward into a new dawn.
The fool and princess landed in the village square, hand in hand, the fool’s laughter now a melody the children mimicked and the princess’s crown askew. The villagers gathered, shouting, 'Tell us what happened!' and the fool grinned, 'The sky wanted a jester, but I brought it a mirror.' The princess kissed him, and the fool felt his stolen laughter rush back, tangled with hers, and the bone fragments in his pocket bloomed into roses. The roses whispered in a voice like wind, 'I owed the sky a jester. Now I’m free,' and the fool wept, planting them in the village square. They married under the tree that had roots in the sky, the fool in patched boots and the princess in a cloak of starlight. The sky stayed aloft, though the fool’s shadow still bristled with teeth, and the villagers learned to sweep around it. They ruled the village with jokes and justice, the fool’s first decree being that all hailstones must be candied before eating. The jester’s ghost danced at their wedding feast, bowing to the fool and saying, 'You’ve made me proud,' before dissolving into a firework. The bone never returned, but the fool no longer needed it, for his feet now knew the weight of the world. And so they lived, the fool and the princess, who learned that the sky falls only when we forget to laugh at its cracks.
