The Prince Who Chased His Own Snore
Once upon a time, a king's son set out to kiss the wind. He went to the highest mountain in the kingdom and climbed to its very top. There he stood and puckered his lips, but the wind blew right past him. Then he ran along the mountain ridge and leapt into the air, and puckered his lips again. But he only tumbled head over heels down a grassy slope and landed in a patch of thistles. The next day, the king's son built a great kite with a long tail and took it to a wide, open plain. He ran with it until the wind caught it, and it rose high into the air, tugging strongly on its string. He tried to pull himself up the string to reach the kite and pucker his lips, but the wind tore the string from his grasp, and the kite flew away. So the king's son, not one whit disheartened, went to seek out an old woman who dwelt by the sea, for it was said she knew the secrets of all moving things. When he asked her how to kiss the wind, she cackled and said, "Hark ye, foolish boy, one kisses not the messenger, but the lips that sent it."
So the king's son thought long on her words, and decided the lips that sent the wind must surely belong to the great, billowing clouds. He returned to his father's kingdom and commanded all the royal masons to build him a tower tall enough to pierce them. The masons worked for a year and a day, and the tower rose to a dizzying height, so that its top was often wreathed in mist. Then the king's son climbed to the very top of the tower, and when a great cloud drifted near, he puckered his lips to kiss it. But the cloud, being only water vapor, passed right through him and around him, and left him quite damp and shivering. The king's son became very wroth at this, and as he shivered, he thought of his father's green parrot, which could speak seven languages and always told the truth. "That bird will surely know who sends the wind, or what its true lips might be!" he declared, and climbed down the tower. He went to the royal gardens where the parrot was kept in a golden cage, and asked it, "Wise parrot, tell me, whose lips command the wind that I might kiss them?" The parrot preened its feathers and replied, "The wind you chase, young master, is the mighty gale that issues from your own lips when you fall asleep and snore like a bellows." The king's son stared, then cried, "Such a thing cannot be, for I am a prince and not a storm!" and he stalked away from the cage in a huff.
Still vexed by the parrot's words, the king's son decided he would travel to see the world, and perhaps forget such foolishness. So he took a stout horse, a purse of gold, and a good sword, and rode out from his father's city gates. He travelled for three days, and on the fourth he came to a dark forest, where he heard someone whistling a merry tune that made his feet begin to tap. Whether he would or no, his horse began to prance and he himself began to jig in the saddle, for the tune was exceedingly potent. Around a bend, he saw the whistler: it was the Devil himself, with a little pointed beard, sitting on a stump and tapping his cloven hoof. "A fine dancer you are, young sir!" chuckled the Devil. "But perhaps you wish to rest? I can make it stop, if you will but give me the third thing you think of." The king's son, dancing till he was breathless and his horse was lathered, cried, "Anything! Only make this cursed music cease!" The Devil grinned, stopped his whistling, and said, "Then I shall take for my payment your mighty snore, the one that shakes the rafters!" The king's son laughed aloud, thinking it a fine jest, and said, "Gladly! Take it and be welcome to it, for it has brought me naught but teasing!" The Devil reached out a smoky finger, plucked something invisible from the prince's throat with a little pop, and vanished in a puff of brimstone.
The king's son rode on, and for many days he journeyed through pleasant lands, thinking no more of the Devil or his lost snore. At last he came to a prosperous kingdom where the king was holding a great feast, for his only daughter, who was very fair, was now of marriageable age. The king's son went to the feast, and when he saw the princess, he thought her the loveliest maiden he had ever beheld. Now, this princess, for all her fairness, had one strange custom: every day at noon, she would go into the castle gardens and eat one small spoonful of the richest earth she could find. The king's son saw her do this the next day from a hidden vantage, and he did not find it odd, but rather charming in its own way. But that very week, the royal gardener complained to the king that the princess, in her search for the finest earth, was digging up all his most prized rose bushes. The king, who loved his roses, decreed that if his daughter could not cease this messy habit, no suitor would be allowed to ask for her hand. The princess was much distressed by this, for she loved her father and wished to marry well, yet she found she could not stop her daily taste of the earth. The king's son saw her weeping secretly in the garden one day, her little silver spoon unused beside her, and he resolved to help her if he could. He went to her then, and said, "Fair princess, I see you are unhappy; tell me your trouble, and perhaps I may find a remedy for it."
The princess, trusting his kind face, told him of her strange craving for the earth, and how she feared she would never marry and would surely die an old maid. "This is a task for one cleverer than I," thought the king's son, and he remembered the Devil who could whistle men to dance and grant boons for a price. So he rode back to the dark forest where he had danced so unwillingly, and called out for the Devil to appear. The Devil appeared at once, smelling faintly of sulphur, and asked, "Well now, young master, what service can I offer you today, and what is your price?" The king's son told him of the princess and her love of dirt, and asked him to take away her craving so she might marry and be happy. "A simple matter!" scoffed the Devil. "I shall do it, but in return, you must give me the princess's ability to weep; she shall never shed another tear." The king's son thought tears a small price for a princess's happiness and a royal marriage, so he agreed at once, saying, "Done! Tears are but salt water." The Devil snapped his smoky fingers with a sound like dry leaves crackling, grinned wider, and was gone as before. The king's son returned to the princess, and sure enough, the next day at noon, when she saw the rich earth, she shuddered and turned away. She no longer desired to eat the earth, and the king was overjoyed, promising the king's son any reward he might ask for his daughter's miraculous recovery.
The king's son, delighted, asked for the princess's hand in marriage, and the grateful king gave his consent without a second thought. Great preparations were made for the wedding, and all the kingdom was joyful, though it was noted by some old women that the princess shed no tears of gladness. On the morning of the wedding, as the princess was being dressed, her little pet songbird, which she loved dearly, suddenly fell from its perch, stone dead. The princess picked it up, and her heart felt as heavy as a stone, yet no tears would come to her eyes though she willed them to. The king's son, who was nearby, saw this, and he remembered the Devil's price, and a great coldness seized him as he understood what he had done. As they were about to lead the tearless princess to the chapel, the merry whistling tune was heard again, and the Devil himself stood in the doorway. Instantly, the entire wedding party, from the king to the smallest page, began to leap and caper, their fine clothes flying. "A fine wedding dance!" sneered the Devil, "But I am here for more than music. A bride who cannot weep is no bride at all, but a thing of naught, and she belongs to me!" With that, he seized her arm and began to drag the still-dancing, wide-eyed princess towards the door, and she, poor thing, could not even cry out in terror. The king's son watched in horror, the Devil's tune still making his legs twitch, and knew he must do something to save her, though he knew not what.
As the Devil neared the door with the princess, and the wedding guests still capered wildly, the king's son suddenly remembered the parrot's words: his own snore was the mighty wind. "If the Devil took my snore," he thought with a jolt that stopped his jigging, "then he now has my wind! And what is a Devil's tune against a prince's hurricane?" With a desperate hope, he threw himself to the floor, closed his eyes tight, and began to make mighty snoring sounds from his throat, though he was wide awake. Lo and behold, a great gust of wind, smelling faintly of thistles and old libraries, rushed forth from his lips and drowned out the Devil's whistling tune. The Devil's pointed beard blew straight up over his head, his hat flew off, and the wind was so strong he was forced to let go of the princess to keep his footing. "Plague take your snoring!" howled the Devil, clutching his bare head. "That is a wind to end all winds!" And he vanished in a particularly noxious puff of smoke. As his whistling faded, the wedding guests stopped their capering and stood about looking bewildered, their finery askew. The princess, no longer dancing, rushed to the king's son, and to everyone's surprise, great tears of joy and relief began to stream down her face. "He has saved you twice, daughter!" cried the king. "Once from your strange appetite, and now from the Devil himself, and restored your very tears! Marry him you shall!" And so they were married that very day, and lived happily to the end of their days, and the princess declared his mighty snores were now the most comforting rumble in all the world.
