var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "This sentence establishes the protagonist as a king's son, a common fairy tale hero, and immediately introduces his peculiar, seemingly impossible quest: to kiss the wind. This sets a slightly whimsical and perhaps foolish tone, hinting at a character who is either naive or driven by an unusual ambition.", "Grimm Style": "Adheres to the simple declarative structure and archetypal character (\"king's son\"). The action (\"set out to kiss the wind\") is stated matter-of-factly, even though it's absurd, which is typical of Grimm's tone. Vocabulary is simple and direct.", "Moral Implication": "Introduces the idea of pursuing unconventional or seemingly unattainable goals. It could be a prelude to a lesson about folly, persistence, or the unexpected outcomes of strange quests.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The King's Son represents the young **Ego**, full of youthful idealism or perhaps naivete. The Wind symbolizes the elusive, the intangible, the spirit, or even fleeting desires. Trying to \"kiss the wind\" can represent the pursuit of impossible ideals, a yearning for connection with something ephemeral, or the folly of early youth trying to grasp concepts beyond its reach. This is the 'innocent youth' stage of life, engaging in seemingly pointless but formative endeavors.", "Sentence": "Once upon a time, a king's son set out to kiss the wind.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "This sentence shows the king's son's initial, literal approach to his quest. He climbs a high place, which is a logical first step if one wants to get closer to the wind, highlighting his simple and direct way of thinking.", "Grimm Style": "Simple action described sequentially (\"He went... and climbed\"). Uses an archetypal setting element (\"highest mountain in the kingdom\"). Language is concrete and straightforward.", "Moral Implication": "Demonstrates effort and determination, even if the goal is strange. It shows a commitment to the chosen path, however unconventional.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Climbing the \"highest mountain\" symbolizes an attempt to elevate oneself, to gain perspective, or to reach for higher consciousness or spiritual understanding in pursuit of the elusive goal (kissing the wind/Spirit). This is the stage of early aspiration, trying to achieve a lofty aim through direct, physical effort.", "Sentence": "He went to the highest mountain in the kingdom and climbed to its very top.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the king's son's action at the mountain top \u2013 puckering his lips \u2013 and the immediate, unsurprising outcome: the wind blows past. This introduces a comedic element of failure due to the inherent impossibility of the task.", "Grimm Style": "Direct description of action (\"puckered his lips\") and consequence (\"wind blew right past him\"). The failure is stated without emotional coloring, which contributes to the deadpan comedy often found in these tales.", "Moral Implication": "Illustrates the limits of simple effort against an uncooperative or intangible force. Some goals cannot be achieved through direct, naive methods alone.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The attempt to physically \"kiss\" the wind with puckered lips shows the Ego's naive and literal approach to a symbolic quest. The wind blowing past signifies the elusiveness of the spiritual or intangible when approached with crude material effort. This represents the initial failures in early life when ideals clash with reality.", "Sentence": "There he stood and puckered his lips, but the wind blew right past him.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "The king's son persists with a slightly modified, but still ineffective, strategy: running and leaping. This emphasizes his determination but also his continued lack of understanding of the wind's nature.", "Grimm Style": "Simple action verbs (\"ran,\" \"leapt\"). Repetition of the failed attempt (\"puckered his lips again\"). The outcome is the same, reinforcing the futility.", "Moral Implication": "Persistence is shown, but without adapting the core strategy to the nature of the problem, it remains fruitless. Highlights the difference between effort and effective action.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Running and leaping represent increased physical exertion and dynamism in the pursuit. It's the stage of youthful energy being expended, still trying to capture the elusive (wind) through more forceful, yet still literal, means. The continued failure shows that more of the same inadequate approach doesn't yield results.", "Sentence": "Then he ran along the mountain ridge and leapt into the air, and puckered his lips again.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 4}, {"Plot Function": "This sentence humorously details the consequence of his leaping: he tumbles down, emphasizing the physical comedy of his failed attempt and the lack of dignity in his pursuit.", "Grimm Style": "Concrete, slightly comical description of the fall (\"tumbled head over heels\"). The outcome is presented factually. Simple conjunctions link the clauses. This type of undignified failure is common in simpleton-esque tales.", "Moral Implication": "Foolish actions can lead to undignified and potentially painful outcomes. Gravity (reality) asserts itself against his airy ambitions.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The fall signifies a literal and metaphorical 'coming down to earth' after a failed attempt at transcendence or grasping the intangible. It's the humbling experience of youthful ambitions meeting harsh reality, often resulting in a loss of composure or a 'fall from grace'. This stage involves learning limitations.", "Sentence": "But he only tumbled head over heels down a grassy slope and landed in a patch of thistles.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "The king's son remains undeterred and devises a new plan, this time involving a man-made object (a great kite) to get closer to the wind, showing a shift from pure physical effort to using tools.", "Grimm Style": "Uses a simple temporal marker (\"The next day\"). Introduction of a new strategy involving a crafted object (\"great kite\"). Verbs are direct (\"built,\" \"took\"). Still a very literal interpretation of his goal.", "Moral Implication": "Demonstrates ingenuity and an unwillingness to give up. Shows learning by trying different methods, even if still fundamentally flawed. Introduces the idea of human artifice in pursuit of a natural force.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The kite represents a human-made construction, an intellectual or technical attempt to engage with the elusive element (wind). This signifies a shift in the Ego's approach from purely physical effort to using tools or mental constructs. It's a more sophisticated, yet still potentially naive, attempt to 'rise above' and connect with the intangible, characteristic of a later phase of youthful exploration.", "Sentence": "The next day, the king's son built a great kite with a long tail and took it to a wide, open plain.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 6}, {"Plot Function": "He successfully gets the kite airborne, achieving height, but the problem of actually kissing the wind remains. This shows partial success in one aspect (reaching the wind's domain) but not in the ultimate goal.", "Grimm Style": "Describes the action sequentially (\"ran with it,\" \"it rose high\"). Simple, effective imagery. Highlights the height achieved.", "Moral Implication": "Shows that clever tools can achieve intermediary goals (getting high in the air), but the fundamental challenge of the main objective persists if the approach is still mismatched.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The kite flying high shows the Ego achieving a certain level of intellectual or spiritual elevation through its own efforts and constructs. It can reach the 'domain' of the wind (the intangible), but this is not the same as achieving true union or understanding (the kiss).", "Sentence": "He ran with it until the wind caught it, and it rose high into the air, tugging strongly on its string.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 7}, {"Plot Function": "The king's son attempts his 'kiss' again, this time from the kite, but the wind's power is too strong for his precarious position, leading to another failure and loss of his tool.", "Grimm Style": "Describes his attempt clearly. The wind's superior power is evident (\"tore the string from his grasp\"). Matter-of-fact description of the kite being lost. Follows the pattern of effort and failure.", "Moral Implication": "Underlines the power of natural forces. Human contraptions are vulnerable. Some things cannot be controlled or forced, no matter how high one gets.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Attempting to 'kiss' from the kite again shows the literal approach. The wind tearing the string signifies that the intangible force (Spirit, unconscious power) cannot be controlled or held by the Ego's constructs (kite). The connection is severed, and the tool for elevation is lost. This represents the experience of losing one's intellectual or spiritual 'high' when confronted by overwhelming forces or when the connection is too tenuous.", "Sentence": "He tried to pull himself up the string to reach the kite and pucker his lips, but the wind tore the string from his grasp, and the kite flew away.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 8}, {"Plot Function": "This sentence shows the king's son undeterred by his repeated failures and deciding to consult a figure of wisdom, an old woman, which is a classic fairy tale trope for seeking guidance when personal efforts fail.", "Grimm Style": "Simple transition (\"So the king's son\"). Introduces an archetypal helper/advisor (\"old woman who dwelt by the sea\"). Uses \"for it was said\" to establish her reputation for wisdom, a common narrative device. Simple purpose (\"to ask her counsel\").", "Moral Implication": "When direct efforts fail, seeking wisdom from experienced elders is a sensible step. Recognizes the limits of his own understanding.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "After repeated failures with direct action and simple tools, the Ego decides to seek wisdom. The \"old woman who dwelt by the sea\" represents the **Wise Old Woman archetype** (Part 9, Archetype 20), often a repository of intuitive, unconscious wisdom. The sea symbolizes the vastness of the unconscious or deep accumulated experience. This marks a shift from youthful, naive action to seeking deeper guidance, a crucial step in maturation.", "Sentence": "So the king's son, not one whit disheartened, went to seek out an old woman who dwelt by the sea, for it was said she knew the secrets of all moving things.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 9}, {"Plot Function": "The old woman's enigmatic and somewhat dismissive response provides a cryptic clue rather than a direct answer, guiding the king's son towards a different understanding of his quest. Her advice is indirect and symbolic.", "Grimm Style": "The old woman's speech is short, slightly archaic (\"Hark ye\"), and metaphorical (\"one kisses not the messenger, but the lips that sent it\"). This is typical of pronouncements from magical or wise figures. It ends the chapter with a riddle or a new direction.", "Moral Implication": "Wisdom is often given indirectly. True understanding requires looking beyond the surface or the immediate agent (the wind as messenger) to the source or the intended meaning. This hints at a deeper, less literal interpretation of his quest.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Wise Old Woman's counsel is symbolic. The wind is a \"messenger.\" The advice to kiss \"the lips that sent it\" redirects the Ego's quest from the literal (the wind itself) to the symbolic source or meaning *behind* the wind/intangible.

The 'foolish' can become wise or powerful.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Against all odds, the Ego's conscious attempt to replicate the unconscious function succeeds, unleashing a powerful psychic wind. This symbolizes the integration and conscious wielding of a previously unconscious, natural energy. This 'wind' (Spirit, primal power) is strong enough to overcome the Shadow's compulsive tune, suggesting that reconnecting with and consciously directing one's own deep, natural energies can dispel negative psychic influences.", "Sentence": "Lo and behold, a great gust of wind, smelling faintly of thistles and old libraries, rushed forth from his lips and drowned out the Devil's whistling tune.", "Chapter Number": 7, "Sentence Number": 64}, {"Plot Function": "The wind physically affects the Devil, blowing him away and causing him to lose his grip on the princess. This is the direct defeat of the antagonist through the prince's unique power.", "Grimm Style": "The wind has a physical, comical effect on the Devil (\"beard blew over his head,\" \"hat flew off\"). He loses his hold on the princess. This is a decisive, almost slapstick defeat for the Devil.", "Moral Implication": "The Devil, despite his cunning, can be overcome by unexpected forces, especially those rooted in an individual's unique (even if previously misunderstood) nature. Good triumphs through an absurd but effective power.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego's reclaimed psychic wind literally blows away the Shadow (Devil), causing him to lose his grip on the Anima. This signifies that the conscious integration and assertion of one's own authentic, primal power can dispel the Shadow's influence and liberate the Anima from its grasp. The Shadow is disoriented and disempowered by this direct blast of integrated energy.", "Sentence": "The Devil's pointed beard blew straight up over his head, his hat flew off, and the wind was so strong he was forced to let go of the princess to keep his footing.", "Chapter Number": 7, "Sentence Number": 65}, {"Plot Function": "The Devil, disheveled and defeated by this unexpected force, makes a hasty retreat, acknowledging the prince's superior 'wind'. This is his final exit from the story.", "Grimm Style": "The Devil's defeat is emphasized by his undignified appearance and his words of concession. His vanishing is typical. The phrase \"a wind to end all winds\" gives a sense of finality to this power.", "Moral Implication": "Even the Devil can be outdone. Recognizing a superior force leads to retreat. The specific nature of the prince's power was the key.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Shadow (Devil), overwhelmed and outmatched by the Ego's integrated power (the snore-wind), retreats. His acknowledgement of the wind's superiority signifies the Shadow being put back in its place, its disruptive influence quelled by the assertion of the Ego's full, authentic (and previously unconscious) strength. This is a significant victory for the Ego.", "Sentence": "\"Plague take your snoring!\" howled the Devil, clutching his bare head. \"That is a wind to end all winds!\" And he vanished in a particularly noxious puff of smoke.", "Chapter Number": 7, "Sentence Number": 66}, {"Plot Function": "With the Devil gone and his music silenced, the wedding guests stop dancing, and order is restored. The immediate crisis is over.", "Grimm Style": "Simple statement of the return to normalcy. The cessation of the magical effect is clear. \"Stood about looking bewildered\" adds a touch of realism and comedy after the chaos.", "Moral Implication": "When the source of evil is removed, its effects cease. Order can be restored after chaos.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "With the Shadow's disruptive influence gone, the collective psychic chaos (compulsive dancing) subsides. The various parts of the psyche (wedding guests) return to a state of conscious control, though bewildered by the experience. This marks the restoration of psychic order after the confrontation with the Shadow.", "Sentence": "As his whistling faded, the wedding guests stopped their capering and stood about looking bewildered, their finery askew.", "Chapter Number": 7, "Sentence Number": 67}, {"Plot Function": "The princess, now freed from the Devil and his tune, miraculously regains her ability to weep, and she weeps for joy and relief. This signifies her full restoration and the breaking of the Devil's second bargain.", "Grimm Style": "The princess's reaction is the emotional climax. The return of her tears is a magical, positive event. Weeping for \"joy and relief\" signifies her emotional wholeness is restored. This undoes the Devil's price.", "Moral Implication": "True liberation can restore what was lost. Emotional expression (tears) is affirmed as vital and good. The defeat of evil can reverse its harmful effects. Her 'mortal danger' is averted.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "With the Shadow defeated and the compulsive energy gone, the Anima (princess) is not only freed from the immediate threat but also has her lost emotional capacity (tears) restored. This might happen because the power that took them (Devil) is vanquished, or because the Ego's act of integrating his own unconscious power (the snore-wind) somehow healed the psychic imbalance that caused her tearlessness. She is now whole again, able to express joy and relief, signifying a complete emotional and spiritual recovery.", "Sentence": "The princess, no longer dancing, rushed to the king's son, and to everyone's surprise, great tears of joy and relief began to stream down her face.", "Chapter Number": 7, "Sentence Number": 68}, {"Plot Function": "The king, overjoyed by this double deliverance (from the Devil and his daughter's tearlessness), enthusiastically sanctions the marriage. This provides the formal approval for the happy ending.", "Grimm Style": "The king's reaction is one of great joy and approval. His pronouncement gives the hero the official reward. This is a standard concluding action for the royal father figure.", "Moral Implication": "Great deeds and the restoration of well-being are royally rewarded. The hero has proven himself truly worthy of the princess.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The ruling conscious principle (King) witnesses the Anima's full restoration (return of tears) and the Ego's heroic act. He enthusiastically approves the union of the now-healed Anima and the individuated Ego. This signifies the conscious mind's full acceptance and celebration of the integrated state.", "Sentence": "\"He has saved you twice, daughter!\" cried the king. \"Once from your strange appetite, and now from the Devil himself, and restored your very tears! Marry him you shall!\"", "Chapter Number": 7, "Sentence Number": 69}, {"Plot Function": "The story concludes with the traditional fairy tale wedding and 'happily ever after', with a final comedic callback to the prince's snoring, which is now accepted and perhaps even cherished. This fulfills the final reward requirement.", "Grimm Style": "Classic fairy tale ending (\"And so they were married\"). The \"lived happily\" is standard. The detail about his snores now being a \"comforting rumble\" provides a humorous and heartwarming resolution to his initial folly and the story's central comedic thread.", "Moral Implication": "True happiness and acceptance are found. Even perceived flaws (like snoring) can become endearing within a loving relationship or when understood in their true context. The journey from folly to wisdom and love is complete.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego and Anima are united in marriage (psychic integration, wholeness). They live 'happily' (a state of psychic balance and fulfillment). The prince's snore (his unique, once misunderstood unconscious power) is no longer a source of misguided quests or shame but is integrated into their shared life as a 'comforting rumble' \u2013 a natural, accepted part of his being. This represents the full acceptance and integration of all aspects of the self, even the once problematic or unconscious ones, leading to lasting harmony. The 'stages of life' journey culminates in this mature, integrated state.", "Sentence": "And so they were married that very day, and lived happily to the end of their days, and the princess declared his mighty snores were now the most comforting rumble in all the world.", "Chapter Number": 7, "Sentence Number": 70}];
