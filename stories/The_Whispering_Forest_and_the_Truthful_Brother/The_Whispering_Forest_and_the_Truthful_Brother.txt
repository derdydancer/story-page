The Whispering Forest and the Truthful Brother
Once upon a time, there lived three brothers in a small cottage at the edge of a great forest, and though they had little to eat, they shared what they had with kindness and good cheer. When winter came harsh and food grew scarce, the brothers decided they must seek their fortune in the world beyond their home. The eldest brother was known throughout the village for his strange condition: on odd-numbered days he could speak only the truth, while on even-numbered days he could say whatever he wished. The middle brother was a cobbler who crafted the finest shoes in seven kingdoms, with hands so skilled they seemed to work of their own accord. The youngest brother spoke rarely but listened well, and could hear whispers that others could not, whether from people, animals, or even the wind through leaves.

Before the brothers departed, their father, old and bent with years, called them to his bedside and presented each with a gift: a small golden key for the eldest, a pair of worn leather boots for the middle brother, and a silver needle for the youngest. "These simple things may seem of little worth," said the father, "but each will serve you well if you remember this: the key opens more than locks, the boots walk toward heart's desire, and the needle binds what eyes cannot see." At dawn the next day, which happened to be the first day of the month, the brothers embraced their father, packed their few belongings, and set out on the road that led into the forest. They had not walked far when they came to a place where the path split into three: one broad and well-trodden, one narrow and winding, and one nearly hidden by thorns and brambles. "I shall take the broad path," said the middle brother, while the eldest chose the narrow way, leaving the youngest to push aside the thorns and follow the hidden trail into the deepest part of the forest.
The youngest brother walked until the sun hung high overhead, and as he ventured deeper into the forest, he began to hear strange whispers from the ancient trees that lined his path. "Beware the clearing ahead," rustled the leaves of an old oak, "for there the sun and moon meet to contest the length of day and night, and mortals who wander between them may be trapped in twilight forever." Despite the warning, the youngest brother's curiosity drew him forward until he reached a perfect circular clearing where, impossibly, the sun shone from one half of the sky while the moon glowed from the other, and between them stood a tall figure in a cloak of stars.

"For a thousand years I have judged the contest between sun and moon," said the figure in a voice like distant thunder, "but I grow weary and seek someone to take my place, someone who can hear what others cannot." The figure pointed a long finger at the youngest brother and said, "You, who can hear the whispers of trees, might have the wisdom to judge fairly, but first you must prove yourself worthy through three tasks." "First," said the cloaked figure, "you must capture the sound of silence and bring it to me before the next dawn."

The youngest brother stood bewildered, for how could one capture something that by its nature could not be heard, much less held in one's hands? As twilight deepened around him, the youngest brother remembered the silver needle his father had given him and the strange words: "the needle binds what eyes cannot see." With trembling fingers, he took out the silver needle and, closing his eyes to listen for the moments between sounds, began to sew the empty air with careful stitches, binding the silence between heartbeats into a small, shimmering pocket of still air. When he opened his eyes, the needle glinted in the moonlight, and hanging from its point was a tiny pouch woven of silver thread that seemed to absorb all sound around it, creating a small space where not even the rustle of leaves could be heard.
Meanwhile, the eldest brother had followed the narrow, winding path until he came to a small village where the people moved about with downcast eyes and spoke in whispers, as though afraid of being overheard. It happened to be an odd-numbered day, so when the eldest brother asked an old woman why everyone seemed so fearful, he could speak only truth: "I am a stranger seeking my fortune, and I wonder what shadow hangs over this place." "We are ruled by a mountain," whispered the old woman, pointing to a peak that loomed over the village, "a mountain that grows taller with each lie told in its presence, and our lord demands we praise him with flattery each day, causing the mountain to rise and threaten to crush us all."

The eldest brother looked at the mountain, which seemed to shimmer strangely in the afternoon light, and realized that his curse of truth-telling might prove a blessing, for on this odd-numbered day, no lie could pass his lips even if he wished it. That very afternoon, the village lord, a man with rings on every finger and a crown too large for his head, summoned all villagers to the mountain's base for the daily ceremony of praise, and noticed the eldest brother standing silent among them. "You there, stranger," called the lord, pointing a bejeweled finger, "step forward and tell me how my splendor compares to all other lords you have seen in your travels."

The eldest brother stepped forward and, bound by the odd-numbered day to speak only truth, declared in a clear voice that carried to all corners of the gathering: "I see a small man made smaller by his need for praise, wearing a crown that rules him more than he rules others." A gasp rose from the crowd, and before their eyes, the mountain trembled and shrank several feet, causing the lord to cry out in rage and order his guards to seize the eldest brother. As the guards approached with drawn swords, the eldest brother reached into his pocket and felt the small golden key his father had given him, remembering the words: "the key opens more than locks." With guards just steps away, he held up the golden key and turned it in the air as if unlocking an invisible door, whereupon a doorway appeared in the empty space before him, opening onto a path that led back into the forest.
The middle brother, meanwhile, had followed the broad, well-trodden path until he reached a prosperous town where a grand contest was underway, with heralds announcing that the king sought the finest craftsman in the land to make a pair of shoes for the princess. Being a cobbler of great skill, the middle brother presented himself at the palace gates, where he was led to a great hall filled with craftsmen from every corner of the kingdom, each displaying shoes of remarkable beauty and design. "The princess," announced the royal steward, "has never walked a step in her life, for her feet turn to different directions, and no shoe has ever fit her properly or given her the courage to stand."

The middle brother looked at his tools and leather and felt a moment of doubt, for he had made many fine shoes but never for such an unusual purpose, and the other craftsmen had brought gold and jewels and exotic materials he could not match. As he pondered what to do, he felt the worn leather boots his father had given him, and remembered the words: "the boots walk toward heart's desire." Through the night, the middle brother worked with steady hands, cutting apart his father's old boots and reshaping them into a pair of shoes unlike any other: not decorated with gold or jewels, but designed to gently guide feet in different directions toward a single path.

When morning came and the craftsmen presented their works, the princess sat on her throne with tears in her eyes, for she had seen many beautiful shoes before but none that could help her walk, and when the middle brother knelt before her with his simple leather creation, the court laughed at their plainness. But when the shoes were placed upon the princess's feet, they seemed to come alive, gently turning her wayward feet toward each other, and for the first time in her life, she stood without assistance and took one step, then another, walking directly toward the middle brother as if drawn by an invisible thread. "These shoes know the desire of my heart," said the princess with wonder in her voice, "which is simply to walk in the world like others do," and the king declared that the middle brother had won not only the contest but also, if he wished it, the hand of the princess in marriage. And so it came to pass that the three brothers were reunited at the royal wedding: the youngest as the new judge of day and night who had captured silence with his needle, the eldest as a truth-teller who had freed a village from a mountain of lies with his key, and the middle brother as the royal cobbler and prince consort whose boots had walked the princess toward her heart's desire.
