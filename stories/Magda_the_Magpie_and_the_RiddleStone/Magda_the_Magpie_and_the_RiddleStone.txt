Magda the Magpie and the Riddle-Stone
In a tall oak beside a king's castle lived a magpie named Magda.
She was cleverer than all the other magpies, and prouder too, for she loved not shiny trinkets, but riddles.
She would listen to the nurses telling riddles to the royal children in the garden, and she learned them all.
Her greatest treasure was a smooth, grey stone she kept hidden in her nest, which she called her Riddle-Stone, though it had no magic but what she imagined.
One day, the King's youngest daughter, Princess Aurelia, lost her favourite silver locket while playing near the oak tree.
It had a picture of her departed mother inside, and she wept bitterly.
The King offered a great reward – a bag of gold and a place at court – to anyone who could find it.
Knights searched the gardens, ladies sifted the flowerbeds, and gardeners trimmed the hedges bare, but the locket was not found.
Magda watched all this from her high branch, preening her glossy feathers.
She knew where the locket was.
A clumsy squirrel had knocked it from the princess’s hand, and it had fallen into a deep crack in the oak tree's trunk, quite hidden from view.
Magda thought, "A bag of gold is useless to a magpie, and court is too noisy.
But perhaps I can have some sport."
She flew down and landed near the weeping princess.
"Princess, cease your tears!" she chattered, for she could mimic speech passably well when she chose.
"I know where your silver lies hidden."
Aurelia looked up in astonishment.
"A talking bird?
You know where my locket is?"
"Aye," squawked Magda, puffing her chest.
"But knowledge has its price.
Answer me a riddle, and I shall tell you."
The princess, desperate, agreed.
Magda tilted her head and asked the first riddle she had learned:
"What has an eye, but cannot see?"
Aurelia thought for a moment, wiping her eyes.
"A needle!" she cried.
"Correct!" chattered Magda.
"Now, listen well.
Your locket lies..."
But then her pride got the better of her.
Why give the answer so easily?"
"It lies," she continued slyly, "where wood meets wood, deep and dark, yet high above the ground."
This was true – the crack was in the trunk above the ground – but purposefully vague.
The princess, confused, thanked Magda and ran to tell her father.
They searched every wooden fence, gate, and bench in the garden, but found nothing.
Magda watched, amused.
The next day, she flew down again.
"Still searching, Princess?
Perhaps another riddle will clear the path?"
Aurelia readily agreed.
Magda asked:
"What has a neck, but has no head?"
"A bottle!" answered the princess promptly.
"Sharp you are!" Magda chirped.
"Now, the locket rests where the squirrel rests, and the owl sleeps, but not in a nest."
Again, true, but misleading.
The searchers now inspected every hollow log and wooden birdhouse.
Still no locket.
On the third day, Magda, puffed with importance, approached the princess again.
"One final riddle, Princess, for the final clue."
She asked her favourite:
"I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish.
What am I?"
This was harder.
Aurelia frowned in concentration.
She thought of the castle, the royal woods, the fishpond.
At last, her face brightened.
"A map!"
Magda clicked her beak in appreciation.
"Indeed!
A map shows the way!
Now, look not on the map, but be the map!
Stand where the shadow of the tallest branch falls at noon, face the oldest stone of the castle wall, and take three hops forward.
There you will find your prize."
This clue was born entirely of Magda’s whim, a riddle in itself.
It had nothing to do with the crack in the tree.
She just wanted to see what would happen.
Following the bizarre instructions, the princess found herself standing before the ancient oak tree itself.
Taking three hops forward brought her right to the base of the trunk.
Puzzled, she looked up, scanning the bark.
And there, just above her head, nestled deep in a shadowed crack she had never noticed before, she saw a glint of silver.
With a cry of joy, she reached in and pulled out her lost locket.
The King was overjoyed and amazed at the cleverness of the riddling magpie.
He offered Magda the bag of gold, but she just cocked her head and chattered, "Gold buys no grubs!
Riddles are my reward!"
He then offered her the place at court, but she ruffled her feathers.
"Too many cats!"
So, the King proclaimed Magda the Royal Riddler.
He commanded that every day a bowl of fresh mealworms and shiny beetles (which Magda *did* like) be placed at the foot of the oak tree.
And whenever the King or his councillors were perplexed by a difficult problem, they would go to the oak tree and call for Magda.
She wouldn't solve their problems, but she would pose riddles, and sometimes, in puzzling out the answers, they found the clarity they sought.
Magda lived long and happily in her oak, the cleverest, proudest, and best-fed magpie in the kingdom, guarding her plain grey Riddle-Stone which, everyone agreed, must surely be magic after all.
