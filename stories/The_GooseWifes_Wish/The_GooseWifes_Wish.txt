The Goose-Wife's Wish
There once lived near a pond a goose-husband and his goose-wife, but though they built a fine nest year after year, they had no gosling. So they went one evening to the great oak tree where an old Owl dwelt, and the goose-husband said, "Wise bird, tell us, how might we get a gosling of our very own?" The Owl blinked his great eyes and hooted softly, "Find ye a smooth white stone that floats upon the water, and let the goose-wife sit upon it for seven days without stirring." They thanked the Owl kindly and went searching by every pond and stream for such a stone, peering at pebbles and poking at reeds. The goose-husband kept crying, "Here is one!" but it was only a lump of mud, or "Surely this is it!" when he found an old boot floating near the bank, and poked it proudly with his beak. At last, the goose-wife nudged him and said, "Look, husband, there it is!" and truly, a smooth white stone was bobbing on the water like a feather. They pushed it ashore with much effort, and the goose-wife settled herself upon the smooth stone, resolving not to move for seven whole days. Now it happened that on the third day, a Jew who lived by lending money at great interest came walking by the pond, counting coins into his hand. He saw the goose-wife sitting quite still upon the stone, and he stopped and said, "What foolishness is this? Do you think to hatch a stone, old bird?" The goose-husband puffed his chest out and replied, "It is no foolishness, good sir Jew, but wisdom from the Owl; by this stone we shall have a gosling at last!"
The Jew's eyes glittered, not with wisdom, but with cunning thoughts, and he thought to himself how he might gain from this foolish goose's belief. He stroked his beard, nodded slowly, and said, "A marvel indeed! I shall return anon," and then he went away towards the village. Now, this Jew kept hens that laid speckled eggs, and from a hidden place he took one egg that seemed warm with kindness, and another, from under a dark stone, that felt cold and wicked. That night, when the moon was hidden by clouds, he crept back to the pond, lifted the sleeping goose-wife softly, took away the floating stone, and placed the two eggs in the nest beneath her. When morning came, the goose-wife felt the warmth of the eggs beneath her, knew not why the stone was gone, but thought, "This is surely a good sign from the Owl!" On the evening of the seventh day, the eggs cracked open, and out hopped two fluffy goslings. One was yellow and fluffy like any other gosling, and cuddled against its mother; the second, however, was paler, and pecked hard at the goose-husband's leg, and its eyes were sharp like little black beads. The goose-husband and his wife greatly rejoiced, and paid no heed to the pecking or the sharp eyes, crying only, "At last! Goslings of our own!" The Jew watched from behind a bush, saw the two goslings, and rubbed his hands together with a sly look. So the goslings grew; one grew plump and cheerful and followed his parents obediently, but the pale one grew lean and clever, with a very sharp beak, and eyes that never missed anything.
The pale gosling soon began to make mischief; he tripped the moorhen chicks, stole the fattest fly from the frog's tongue with a quick dart, and pulled the sleeping duckling's tail feathers. The goose-husband and wife sighed and shook their heads, but said only, "He is young," or, "He is full of spirit," and, "Truly, he means no harm." One day, the Jew came by again and saw the pale gosling tormenting a beetle; he called softly, "Hsst, clever bird, come hither," and held out a shiny copper coin. The pale gosling cocked his head, left the beetle, and waddled closer, his sharp eyes fixed on the glittering coin. "A clever bird like you could have many such coins," whispered the Jew, "if you but fetch me the little golden locket the princess wears when she walks by the river tomorrow." The pale gosling nodded his head quick as a snake's strike, gave a sharp hiss, and thought how he would hide among the rushes by the river bank. The next day, the king's daughter, who was very beautiful, came walking beside the river as the Jew had said, dangling her golden locket from a ribbon. As the princess looked away at a dragonfly hovering over the water, the pale gosling darted out from the rushes, snatched the locket in his sharp beak with a quick tug, and was gone swift as thought. The princess gave a cry, felt at her neck, and looked about wildly, but the pale gosling was vanished among the reeds, and her locket too. The pale gosling found the Jew waiting in the woods nearby, dropped the golden locket at his feet, and looked up for his reward.
The Jew clutched the locket greedily, glanced about, then tossed the pale gosling one dull farthing, saying, "That is payment enough for a bird's work; be off with you!" The pale gosling hissed with fury at the poor payment, flew straight at the Jew's face, and pecked furiously at his eyes. The Jew cried out in pain, stumbled back, dropping the golden locket in the dirt, and shouted, "A plague on you! Curse your sharp beak!" Now it chanced that the good, yellow gosling came wandering that way, saw the locket shining in the dirt, and because it shone prettily, picked it up gently in his beak. He trotted home to the nest and showed it to his parents, who knew it at once for the princess's lost locket and were much alarmed. "Oh dear, oh dear!" quacked the goose-wife, "This will bring great trouble!" and the goose-husband agreed, saying, "Though simple geese we may be, we know this must be returned to the king's daughter straight away." So they told the yellow gosling to take this back to the palace garden where the princess sometimes walked, and to give it to her if he saw her. The good gosling set off at once, and waddled along the path towards the palace garden, holding the locket gently so it would not be scratched. Meanwhile, the beautiful princess was sad, for she loved her locket dearly as it was a gift from her departed mother. He saw the princess sitting on a bench in the garden, weeping softly into a handkerchief, and he waddled straight up to her across the lawn.
The yellow gosling reached her bench, stood on his tiptoes, and laid the golden locket carefully in her lap. The princess looked down in surprise, saw the locket, and gave a cry of joy, saying, "My locket! Oh, thank you, little goose! However did you find it?" The good gosling could only honk softly, but he pointed with his beak towards the dark woods, and then shook his head sadly from side to side. The princess, who was wise as well as beautiful, thought she understood his meaning: the locket had been in the woods, and there had been some trouble. She patted his soft head, and fetched him fine white cake crumbs and a handful of sweet grain from the pantry in thanks. Then she ran to the king her father, showed him the locket, and told him how the good little goose had returned it, pointing towards the dark woods with a troubled look. The king frowned, for he recalled hearing of the Jew's cunning dealings, and ordered his chief huntsman to take two men and search the woods, and find the Jew if he were there. The huntsmen found him easily, sitting beneath a tree and bathing his eyes, which were red and swollen, with water from a flask. "What do you here? And why are your eyes thus?" asked the chief huntsman, but the Jew answered quickly, "Nothing, good sirs, only resting; a bee stung me most unkindly."
"A bee gives no farthings," said the chief huntsman, "This is a queer tale indeed; you must come with us before the king." And they bound his hands. The king heard all the huntsmen had to tell, looked at the Jew's swollen eyes and the dull farthing, remembered his daughter's tale of the goose pointing to the woods, and shrewdly put this and that together, guessing the Jew had used some wicked bird to steal the locket. "You villain!" said the king to the Jew, "I wager you made some poor creature steal my daughter's locket, and then cheated it of its reward, earning those sore eyes!" The Jew, seeing the king knew all and fearing punishment, fell on his knees and confessed everything; how he had tricked the goose-parents, stolen the magic stone, and put the two eggs, one good and one evil, in its place. Then the king understood why one gosling was good and gentle, and the other pale and wicked, hatched from the evil egg the Jew had placed there. "Since you deal in wickedness for coins, and cheated a poor bird with a farthing after stealing my daughter's gold," declared the king, "you shall now swallow all the gold coins in my treasury, until you burst!" And so the guards brought sacks of gold, and forced them down the Jew's throat, one after another, until at last he burst with a great pop, and that was the end of him. "As for the pale gosling," said the king, "though hatched from an evil egg placed by that villain, it still causes mischief and cannot remain here; it must be banished from my kingdom." So a huntsman caught the pale gosling, which hissed and snapped all the while, carried it far away to the wildest mountains, and left it there.
And there the goose-husband and wife and their good son lived happily, and were much respected by all the ducks and moorhens in the garden pond. The yellow gosling became the princess's particular favourite, and would follow her about the garden, and sometimes carry messages for her in a little pouch tied round his neck. But the strangest thing was this: on his left wing, hidden unless he stretched it wide, grew one small, perfect golden feather, for he had been hatched from the Jew's good egg after all. One day the princess saw it when he stretched his wing in the sun, and she marvelled, but told no one, keeping it as a secret between them. And the good gosling grew old, and became a wise and gentle goose, and always stayed near the princess. As for the pale one in the mountains, some say he became king of the vultures and caused much trouble to shepherds for many a year. The old goose-husband and wife never had another gosling, but they were content, for as they often said, one good son is better than none at all, especially one with a golden feather. When the princess grew up, she married a good prince, and her wise goose friend was always given a place of honor at their court. And if they have not died, they are living there still; and perhaps the wise goose sometimes shows his golden feather when the sun shines just right. That is the whole story.
