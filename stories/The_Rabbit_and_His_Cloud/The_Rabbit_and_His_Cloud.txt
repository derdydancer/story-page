The Rabbit and His Cloud
There once was a Rabbit who lived in a burrow near a field, and one day a small, dark cloud appeared above his head. The Rabbit hopped about his field, but the cloud did not move with the wind, it stayed always right above him. He ran quickly to the edge of the woods, so the cloud followed just as quickly. Then the Rabbit stopped and thought, 'I must find a way to be rid of this cloud.' Just then, a Mouse, who was very nervous, scurried past the Rabbit's feet. The Rabbit stamped his foot and cried, 'Halt!', but the little cloud above cast a deep shadow, and the Mouse did not see him clearly. The Mouse squeaked in surprise, jumped nearly out of his skin, and dropped something small and colourful he carried. It was an umbrella, no bigger than a mushroom, bright red and yellow, and the Rabbit snatched it up, for it looked like magic. He opened the little umbrella at once and held it high above his head. The small, dark cloud did not move, but the Rabbit's ears suddenly drooped sadly against his cheeks.
The Rabbit closed the umbrella and looked at it, wondering how it worked and how he might learn its secret. Presently, the nervous Mouse came creeping back through the grass, looking for his umbrella. The Rabbit held up the umbrella and said, 'Tell me of its magic, little Mouse, or you shall not have it back.' The Mouse trembled and replied, 'I know not its magic, good Rabbit, but the wise old Badger who dwells by the hollow oak knows all such things.' 'Then I will seek this Badger,' declared the Rabbit, and twitching his nose, he added, 'Be off with you now,' but he kept the umbrella. So the Rabbit went towards the hollow oak where the Badger dwelt, and the dark cloud followed close above. He found the Badger sitting outside his burrow, carefully sorting through a pile of muddy roots. 'Wise Badger,' said the Rabbit, 'tell me the magic of this umbrella I have found.' 'Ah, the Sun-and-Shower Umbrella!' grumbled the Badger, 'It works only if opened with the tear of a Weasel shed unwillingly.' 'Then I must get one,' the Rabbit stated plainly, already thinking of where Weasels might be found.
The Rabbit looked here and there for a Weasel, the cloud pressing down just above his drooping ears. Soon he spied a Weasel peeking from behind a thorny bush; it darted back when it saw the Rabbit. The Rabbit did not give chase but found a fat grub and placed it carefully on a leaf near the bush. He hid and waited, and soon the Weasel crept out again and snatched the grub. As it turned, the Rabbit leapt out and caught the Weasel firmly by the scruff of its neck. 'Weep now, Weasel!' the Rabbit demanded, 'Shed one unwilling tear for me, or I shall squeeze!' The Weasel kicked and spat, but it only glared fiercely and said, 'I shall never weep for a Rabbit!' The Rabbit thought again and said, 'Poor Weasel, you are right, you are too scrawny and weak for tears; a fine Weasel would weep.' Stung by the insult, the Weasel gave a howl of rage, and a single hot tear rolled down its cheek. The Rabbit deftly caught the tear on a leaf, dropped the sputtering Weasel, and ran back towards the hollow oak.
He reached the Badger's burrow and held out the leaf, saying, 'Here is the tear of a Weasel!' 'Good,' grunted the Badger, 'Now touch the tear to the tip of the closed umbrella, and open it slowly.' The Rabbit did as he was told; he touched the tear to the umbrella's metal tip and began to open the bright panels. A patch of bright sunshine appeared beneath the umbrella, and tiny blue flowers bloomed instantly at the Rabbit's feet, but the dark cloud remained. The Rabbit stamped his foot and snapped the umbrella shut again, crying, 'Useless trinket! It does nothing for the cloud!' 'That is the Sun aspect,' the Badger explained calmly, 'For the Shower to wash away troubles, you need the feather of a sleepless Griffin.' 'Where does this Griffin live?' the Rabbit asked at once, clutching the umbrella tightly. The Badger pointed with a claw, 'Beyond the Whispering Reeds, atop the Glass Mountain, but few return from there.' 'I shall return,' the Rabbit said firmly, though the cloud above seemed a little darker now. He set off towards the Whispering Reeds, and the cloud above felt heavier upon his head.
The Rabbit came to the Whispering Reeds, which rustled constantly though there was no wind, and seemed to whisper secrets. He paid them no mind, being concerned only with finding the path through to the mountain beyond. Suddenly, the nervous Mouse tumbled out of the reeds, quite lost and trembling with fear. 'Aha!' thought the Rabbit, 'Perhaps this foolish creature can find the way,' and he said aloud, 'Mouse, guide me through these reeds!' The Mouse was too frightened of the Rabbit and the reeds to refuse, so he squeaked, 'Yes, yes, Rabbit, follow me!' He darted to and fro in panic, but by chance his fearful scurrying showed the Rabbit where the firm ground lay between the roots. When they were safely through, the Rabbit gave the Mouse a nudge with his foot and said, 'Now be gone!' The terrified Mouse scurried away so fast he knocked loose a flat stone beside the path, and beneath it lay a tarnished silver locket. The Rabbit sniffed at the locket, saw it offered no help against the cloud, and tossed it into the reeds. He looked up then and saw the Glass Mountain before him, smooth and steep, offering no hold for paw or claw.
He tried to scramble up, but his paws found no purchase, and he slid back down. He gathered himself and leapt higher, yet still he slid down again. Then the Rabbit remembered the umbrella tucked in his fur and wondered if its magic might help him climb. He took it out and opened the bright red and yellow panels once more. Instead of sticking to the glass, the umbrella lifted him off his paws, and he floated unsteadily upward. The dark cloud seemed to press down upon the umbrella, making it tilt this way and that, and spun him round. He could not steer, and a gust of wind caught him and blew him away from the glassy slope. He came down with a bump in a rocky valley far below, but found himself near a high cliff face. Looking up, he saw the Griffin perched high above, its sharp eyes wide open; it was truly sleepless. The Rabbit hid behind a rock and began to scheme how he might steal a feather from such a watchful beast.
He watched for a whole day as the Griffin scanned the valley below or sharpened its beak on the stone. He noticed that sometimes, when it ruffled its neck feathers, a tiny, soft feather might drift down. 'If only it would preen nearer the edge,' thought the Rabbit, 'then a feather might fall to me.' He searched the valley and found a piece of shiny rock, for it is known Griffins love glittering things. With great effort, he climbed part way up the cliff by a narrow crack and placed the stone carefully near the edge of the Griffin's perch. The Griffin soon spotted the glitter, tilted its head, and hopped closer to examine the shiny stone. While looking at the stone, it ruffled its feathers, and one small, downy feather floated down towards the waiting Rabbit. The Rabbit leapt and caught it neatly before it touched the ground. He turned at once and scrambled down the cliff, without a backward glance at the Griffin or the shiny stone. He hurried back the way he came, clutching his prize, while the dark cloud still hovered faithfully above.
'I have the feather of the sleepless Griffin!' the Rabbit announced proudly, presenting it to the Badger. 'Well done,' said the Badger, examining the feather, 'Place this beside the spot where the tear touched the metal tip.' The Rabbit carefully fixed the soft feather to the umbrella's tip with a bit of sticky sap. Then, full of hope, he opened the umbrella once more and aimed it straight at the dark cloud. Water poured down instantly, not from the sky, but from the umbrella itself, soaking the Rabbit to the skin while the cloud above was quite dry. The Rabbit stood dripping and stunned, staring up at the dark cloud which floated serenely above his miserable, wet head. 'Foolish Rabbit,' the Badger sighed, 'That umbrella does not drive away clouds; it carries them. Its shower reflects what is carried within.' The Rabbit paid no heed to this, shivering and cross, demanding, 'What more must I do? Tell me the final secret!' 'There is one last thing,' the Badger said slowly, 'If you would truly understand. Bring me the silence kept by the Chattering Magpie in the old pine.' The Rabbit did not understand 'silence' as a thing to be brought, but resolved he would catch the bird itself, and set off for the old pine.
He found the old pine, and the Chattering Magpie was there indeed, flitting from branch to branch, chattering without cease. Remembering the Griffin, the Rabbit found a shiny bead dropped by some traveller and placed it on a low branch. The Magpie only chattered louder, mocked the bead from a higher branch, and ignored it. The Rabbit grew angry and shouted, 'Silence, bird, or I will climb up and make you silent!' and tried to climb the pine. But the pine was tall, and the Magpie simply flew higher, chattering down at the Rabbit's struggles. Worn out and defeated, the Rabbit sat down under the pine tree and simply watched the bird. As he sat quite still, not scheming or shouting, the Magpie strangely grew quiet too, listening. For a moment, beneath the dark cloud, there was only silence in the branches between the Rabbit and the bird. 'This is the silence!' thought the Rabbit, 'I must bring it back!' and he leapt up, holding out his paws as if to catch it. Of course, the Magpie gave a loud squawk and flew off chattering, leaving the Rabbit with empty paws and the heavy cloud.
The Rabbit trudged back to the Badger's burrow and confessed, 'I could not bring the silence.' 'I know,' said the Badger sadly, 'The cloud, you see, belongs to the umbrella. Perhaps it came when you first lifted it near the woods.' The Rabbit looked down at the bright red and yellow umbrella in his paws. He tried to throw it away, but it seemed to cling to his paws as if stuck fast. At that moment, the nervous Mouse peeped out from behind the Badger's legs. 'Here, take it back!' cried the Rabbit, and he thrust the umbrella fiercely into the Mouse's trembling paws. The umbrella stuck fast, and the small, dark cloud instantly zipped across from above the Rabbit to hover over the terrified Mouse. The Mouse gave a wild squeak and fled into the woods with the cloud bobbing over his head. The Rabbit stood alone in the field; the sun shone, but the air felt cold around him. And perhaps he hops there still, under a clear sky, wondering why the field seems so empty.
