The Weaver and the Giant's Beard
Once, in a high mountain valley, lived a young weaver named Elspeth. She was known throughout the villages for the fineness of her thread and the beauty of her patterns, but she was poor, for the valley folk had little coin. Above the valley lived a cruel and foolish Giant, who owned all the best pastures and demanded heavy tribute. His greatest pride was his enormous, bushy black beard, which flowed down past his knees.
One year, the Giant demanded a tribute so heavy that the villagers despaired. They would surely starve come winter. Elspeth, though small, had a quick mind and a brave heart. She went to the village elder. "I will face the Giant," she said. "But I need the finest lock of wool from every sheep in the valley, dyed the colour of the midnight sky."
The villagers, though doubtful, gathered the wool, for they had no other hope. Elspeth spent three days and three nights spinning it into a single, incredibly fine thread, stronger than any rope, yet almost invisible in shadow. She dyed it black as pitch. Then, taking her smallest loom and the single shuttle wound with the magic thread, she climbed the mountain path to the Giant's cave.
The Giant was sitting outside, roaring with laughter as he counted his sacks of grain taken from the villagers. "Ho there, little gnat!" he bellowed when he saw Elspeth. "Have you brought me more tribute?"
Elspeth bowed low. "Great Giant," she said, her voice clear but respectful, "I have brought you no grain, for we have none left. But I have brought my skill. I can weave you a cloth finer than any mortal possesses, a cloth made of night itself."
The Giant guffawed, spraying pebbles. "Weave? You think I need your flimsy rags? My clothes are made of bearskin!"
"Ah," said Elspeth cunningly, "but this cloth I speak of is special. It can capture dreams. Weave it into your beard, mighty Giant, and you shall have only pleasant dreams forever."
The Giant, who was often troubled by nightmares of losing his beard or tripping over his own feet, grew interested. "Capture dreams, you say? Weave it into my beard? Show me this thread!"
Elspeth held up the shuttle. The thread was so fine and dark it seemed like a strand of shadow. The Giant squinted. "Bah! That flimsy thing? It would break!"
"Let me show you its strength, great one," Elspeth said. She quickly set up her tiny loom, anchoring one end to a stout rock near the Giant's foot. "Allow me just to tie the other end, for stability," she said, approaching his beard. Before the dull-witted Giant quite understood, she had deftly looped the end of the magic thread around a thick hank of his beard near the very bottom, securing it with a weaver's knot that tightened under pressure.
"Now," she said, moving back to the loom, "watch!" She began to weave, her shuttle flying back and forth. But she wasn't weaving cloth. She was subtly weaving the magic thread *through* the tangled depths of the Giant's massive beard, looping it around rocks on the ground, anchoring it to sturdy roots, passing it back and forth, creating an invisible, intricate net that bound the lower part of his beard to the mountainside itself. The thread was so fine and dark, the Giant noticed nothing but the rhythmic click-clack of the loom. He was already half-dozing, thinking of pleasant dreams.
After an hour, Elspeth cut the thread from the loom. "It is done, great Giant," she announced. "The dream-catcher is woven into the very fabric of your magnificent beard."
The Giant yawned mightily. "Good. Now be off with you, gnat, before I decide to use you as a toothpick."
Elspeth scurried away. As soon as she was safely down the path, she shouted back, "Oh, Giant! Look, a fearsome dragon approaches from the east!"
The Giant, startled from his doze, leaped to his feet in alarm. But he only got halfway up. The invisible net of magic thread, woven through his beard and anchored to the rocks and roots, held fast. He tugged, and the knots tightened. He roared and pulled, but he was tethered to the ground by his own magnificent beard. He thrashed and bellowed, but the fine thread, woven with skill and the strength of the whole valley's flock, would not break.
He raged all night, trapped by his pride and Elspeth's cunning. By morning, he was exhausted and humbled. The villagers, hearing the commotion, came up the mountain and found their tormentor helpless.
"Release me!" the Giant pleaded, his voice hoarse. "Release me, and I shall demand no tribute for seven years! And you can graze your flocks on my lower pastures!"
Elspeth approached cautiously. "Swear it by your beard, Giant," she commanded.
"I swear it by my beard!" he groaned.
Elspeth then took a small, sharp pair of shears from her weaving kit and carefully, painstakingly, cut the magic threads, freeing him. The Giant, chastened and sore, rubbed his neck and stomped back into his cave without another word.
The villagers rejoiced. Elspeth was hailed as a hero. They grazed their flocks on the lower pastures, and for seven years, they lived free from the Giant's demands. And Elspeth the weaver, though still poor in coin, was rich in honour and the gratitude of her people.
