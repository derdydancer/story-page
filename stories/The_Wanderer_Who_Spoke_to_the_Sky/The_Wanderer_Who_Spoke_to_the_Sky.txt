The Wanderer Who Spoke to the Sky
There was a youth, a son of Zeus he was, though he knew not his own name nor that of his father. He wandered aimlessly through fields and forests, and knew not whence he had come, or whither he was bound. Hunger gnawed at him, and when he came to a village, he asked: 'Good folk, have you bread to spare?' but they, seeing his strange, lost manner, gave him naught. He sat by a river, weary and forlorn, and as he looked upon the current, the waters parted slightly before his gaze, though he himself marked it not. So he journeyed on, and the days turned into weeks, and he crossed mountains high and valleys deep, but the mist in his mind did not lift. Once, he met a woodsman felling a great oak, and the woodsman said: 'A man without a past is like a tree without roots; he may stand for a while, but the first strong wind will topple him.' The youth thought on these words and knew them to be true, for he felt like such a tree, and so he went on. At night, when he slept beneath the stars, dreams came to him: flashes of bright light and the sound of thunder, but he could not grasp their meaning. Sometimes, he told his dreams to a shepherd or a travelling merchant, but they only shook their heads and said such things were beyond their ken. So the youth continued his search for himself, with naught but the clothes on his back and a growing, unnamable sense of something vast stirring within him.
At last he came to a great city, bustling with merchants and craftsmen, and the air was full of shouts and the clang of hammers. He sought to find a place for himself, but wherever he went, men asked him: 'Who are your people? What is your trade?' and he could only answer: 'I do not know.' One day, a carter's wagon was stuck fast in the mud, and the youth, without thinking, took hold of the wheel and lifted it as if it were a toy; but the carter only stared in wonder and muttered that the lad was strong, but witless. The youth felt a curious warmth spread through his arms after this, but he knew not what to make of it, and soon forgot the cart and the carter. For a time, he found work carrying water for a baker, who was too busy to ask many questions, and so the youth earned a few pennies for bread. But the dreams of light and thunder grew more frequent and more clear, and sometimes he would wake with a start, his heart pounding. One morning, he felt an urge he could not name to leave the city and walk towards a lone mountain that stood stark against the sky in the distance. Without a word to the baker, he left the city gates behind him and set his face towards the distant peak. The land grew wilder as he walked, and soon the path grew faint, and the trees of the forest grew thick and dark around him. By nightfall, he reached an ancient wood that lay at the foot of the great mountain, and there he resolved to rest before the morrow.
When morning came, the youth entered the ancient wood, and he had not gone far when he came upon an old man sitting on a fallen log, clad in grey, with a long white beard. The old man looked up as he approached, and his eyes, though ancient, were keen, and he said: 'I have waited long for you, wanderer with no name.' The youth was much surprised at this greeting and asked: 'How can this be, good father, for I know you not, and none know of my journey?' The old man smiled a little and replied: 'Though your mind has forgotten, the path of destiny does not forget. I am he who taught you your first letters under a different sky, and the ways of the eagle in the sky.' The youth's heart was stirred by these words, for the mention of eagles seemed to touch a hidden chord, yet he said: 'Alas, your words awaken something faint within me, but I see no clear image of such a time.' The old man nodded gravely and said: 'Memory is a clouded well, young one. Prithee, do you not recall a hidden mark upon your shoulder, like a tiny lightning bolt, that only I and your true kin would know?' The youth reached for his shoulder, though he knew of no such mark, and as he did so, a faint tingling, as of distant static, passed over his skin there. He looked, but found no mark, and said to the old man: 'There is a feeling, sir, but I see naught upon my skin. Perhaps it faded with time, or was never there.' The old man declared: 'Some marks are not for the eyes alone. Come with me to the summit of this mountain, where the sky speaks to the stone, and perhaps your spirit will remember what your flesh has forgotten.' The youth, having no other path to follow and feeling a strange pull from the old man's words, agreed to go with him up the great mountain.
So they began to climb, and the path was steep and treacherous, yet the old man, for all his years, moved with the nimbleness of a mountain goat. As they climbed, the old man spoke little, but when he did, he asked strange questions, such as: 'What does the wind whisper to the highest peaks?' or 'Can you feel the pulse of the rock beneath your feet?' The youth could not answer these questions with words, but sometimes, as he listened, he felt a stirring within him, like a faint echo of a song once known. After many hours, they came to a place where a great chasm barred their way, deep and wide, with jagged rocks far below. The youth saw no way across, but the old man pointed to the sheer cliff opposite and said: 'Look not down into the darkness, but call to the air as if it were your brother, and bid it bear you.' Though his heart trembled, the youth did as he was bidden, and as he spoke to the unseen air, a sudden gust of wind arose from the chasm, and for a moment, it seemed to lessen the gap before them. The old man smiled and said: 'See? The world answers those who know how to ask. But for now, there is a narrow, hidden ledge just below this outcrop, which we shall use.' They crossed the chasm with care upon the hidden ledge, and for the rest of that day, the youth was silent, thinking on the gust of wind and the old man's words. As evening drew nigh, they reached a desolate place near the summit, a plateau of bare rock where the wind howled and mists swirled. The old man stopped and gestured to a shallow cave. 'Here you must stay the night alone,' he said, 'for the mountain has secrets it shares only in solitude, and tomorrow, your path may become clearer.'
The youth sat alone in the shallow cave as darkness fell, and the wind shrieked like a hungry spirit, and the cold bit deep into his bones. Towards midnight, a great storm broke forth upon the mountain; lightning split the sky, and thunder rolled like giants' drums, shaking the very rock beneath him. Yet, the youth felt no fear, but a strange, wild joy, and he stood at the mouth of the cave as if the storm were an old friend come to call. He raised a hand towards the tempest, not knowing why he did so, and a fork of lightning that seemed bound for the cave mouth itself swerved slightly, and struck a nearby crag instead with a deafening crack. The youth stood dumbfounded, his arm still outstretched, for it seemed to him that he had, in some way, turned the lightning from its course. He tried again, concentrating with all his might on a distant peak, and as another flash illuminated the sky, he felt a pull within him, and the light seemed to bend towards his will, and strike where he had looked. As dawn approached, the storm abated as quickly as it had come, leaving the air clean and sharp, but the youth knew that he was not the same wanderer who had entered the cave. With the first light, the old man returned, his grey cloak damp with dew, and he looked at the youth keenly for a long moment, then a slow smile touched his lips. 'So,' said the old man, 'the sky has spoken to its own blood, has it not? You have found a spark of what was lost to you.' The youth felt a great lightness, for though his name and past were still veiled, a path now lay before him: to understand the power that had awakened on the storm-wracked mountain.
They went down from the high places, and the youth walked with a new certainty in his step, his eyes often turning to the vast sky above. When they reached the forest's edge once more, the old man said: 'The spark you hold is potent, child of thunder. Power without wisdom is a wild fire; seek to understand its nature before you seek to command it fully.' Then, before the youth could offer thanks or ask more, the old man turned and was gone into the shadows of the wood as if he had never been. The youth travelled on, no longer a lost soul, but a seeker, observing the clouds, the winds, the play of light before a storm. He came to a parched land where a village lay in the path of a raging wildfire, driven by a fierce, dry wind, and the people despaired. Remembering the old man's words and the feeling on the mountain, the youth stood before the advancing flames, closed his eyes, and raised his hands to the smoke-filled sky, calling not with his voice, but with his will. Slowly, the wind began to shift, and from the clear sky, dark clouds gathered with unnatural speed, and soon a quenching downpour began, and the fire was subdued. The villagers rejoiced and hailed him as a 'Sky-Friend', and as he heard their grateful cries, a name echoed in his own mind, clear and strong: 'Astrapeon'. With the name came images: a shining mountain far grander than any he had climbed, a stern but loving face with eyes like the storm, and a voice like thunder speaking his name with pride. He knew now who he was, a son of Zeus, and though much was still clouded, Astrapeon, the Sky-Friend, chose to walk among mortals, using his gifts with the care the old man had counselled, his journey to find himself at an end, and a new one begun.
