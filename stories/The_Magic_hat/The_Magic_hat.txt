The Magic hat
There was once a tailor's son whose own mother was dead, and whose father had taken a new wife who looked unkindly upon the boy. Now, the boy possessed naught from his true mother save an old felt hat, plain and grey. Yet when he wore this hat, a strange thing happened: he could hear the thoughts of women nearby as clear as spoken words. One day, wearing the hat, he heard his stepmother think, 'That lazy boy eats too much; I must find a way to be rid of him soon.' So the next morning, she said sweetly, "Dear boy, I have such a craving for ripe strawberries; go now into the deepest woods and fetch me a basketful." The boy knew it was winter and strawberries did not grow, but he obeyed his stepmother, put on his grey hat, took a small basket, and went towards the woods. In the woods, a squirrel chattered from a branch, "Strawberries now? The boy is mad!" and a rabbit wrinkled its nose, saying, "He will find only snow!" But the boy kept his hat on, and heard the squirrel's *wife* thinking, 'Silly male! He forgets the hidden hollow by the frozen spring where the sun spirits keep berries warm all year.' The boy followed the direction of the thought, and truly, by a frozen spring in a deep hollow, he found a patch of green leaves and gathered a basketful of red strawberries. He went home and gave the basket to his stepmother, who was greatly vexed to see him back safe and sound with such fine fruit.
The next day she said, "You are clever, perhaps, but idle. Go now to the King's mews, and count precisely how many feathers are upon his swiftest hawk, for I need to know." The boy went to the royal castle, wearing his grey hat, though he knew counting a hawk's feathers was a fool's errand. Near the mews stood the King's daughter, who was very beautiful, watching the falconers. With his hat on, the boy heard her thinking clearly, 'Oh dear, did I leave the window open for my little bird? It might fly away!' The boy, forgetting the feathers entirely, ran quickly to the princess's chambers, saw the open window, closed it gently, and hurried back before anyone saw him. Later, the princess remarked to her maids, "How strange! I was certain I left my window open, yet I found it closed." The boy returned to his stepmother and said only that the hawk would not sit still, and so he could not count the feathers. She was angry, but the boy heard her thinking, 'That wretched boy! But wait, did I hide my good silver spoon well enough from the cook? I must check presently.' Now the King heard tell of the strangely closed window, and being pleased that his daughter's bird was safe, he proclaimed that whoever had secured the window would receive a purse of gold. The tailor's son heard the proclamation and thought the gold would be useful, but knew not how a poor boy could claim such a deed before the King.
His stepmother, having secured her spoon, now said, "Boy, the royal goose-girl weeps for her geese lay no eggs. Go and find out the reason why." So the boy went to where the royal geese were kept, and saw the goose-girl sighing sadly, and he put his hand upon his old grey hat. He heard the goose-girl thinking, 'Oh, their highnesses find the ground too cold for their feet! If only they had little woollen socks, they would surely lay, but the steward just laughs when I say so.' The boy pondered how to tell this without seeming foolish or revealing his secret hat. He then gathered some loose wool his father, the tailor, had discarded, and scattered it 'accidentally' near the geese's nesting spots. The goose-girl saw the wool, had a sudden thought, and that very afternoon knitted tiny, ill-fitting socks for the lead goose and her favorite companion. Lo and behold, the next morning the two sock-wearing geese proudly laid fine, large eggs, and the others soon followed suit when given similar comforts. The boy told his stepmother only that the geese were now content, and the eggs were plentiful once more. The King, hearing his geese were laying again, was so pleased he declared that whoever discovered the secret should be made overseer of all royal fowl, with fine lodgings and a good stipend. The goose-girl told how the boy had visited just before the change, and thus the tailor's son was given the post of overseer, though none knew how he had truly learned the geese's desire.
The stepmother saw the boy in his fine new overseer's coat and grew black with envy, thinking, 'This cannot stand! Tonight, I shall put poison in his evening milk.' As the boy passed her later that day, his hat revealed her terrible thought, and he knew his life was in danger. That evening, when she offered him the cup of milk with a false smile, the boy pretended to stumble. As he stumbled, the cup flew from his hand and splashed upon the hearth, where the cat later sniffed at it and fell down senseless. The stepmother saw the senseless cat and her face went pale, then red with fury that her plan had failed. In her fury, she shrieked at the boy before his father, "You wicked boy! You spilled that milk on purpose to vex me!" The boy replied calmly, "Why would milk vex you so, stepmother, unless it held more than nourishment? See how the poor cat lies still." The tailor, hearing this and seeing the stricken cat and his wife's frantic expression, looked hard at his wife for the first time. He questioned his wife sternly, found the poison vial hidden in her apron, and banished her forthwith from his house and the town with only the clothes on her back. When the King learned how the overseer had cleverly escaped poison, he summoned the youth and gave him a chest full of silver and his personal favour.
The King's daughter now smiled kindly upon the youth whenever she saw him overseeing the fowl or walking in the palace gardens. One day, walking with the princess near the mews, he felt bold enough to tell her the truth about his old grey hat and how it had helped him. The princess marvelled, and begged to try the hat, but when she put it on, she heard only the clucking of hens and declared it must only work for him. The King saw his daughter's fondness for the clever youth who held his favour, and thought him a worthy match despite his beginnings. Therefore, the King called the tailor's son to him and offered him his daughter's hand in marriage. The youth accepted with great joy, for he had come to care deeply for the beautiful princess. A great wedding feast was held, lasting seven days, and the whole kingdom rejoiced. The new prince used his silver and position wisely, ensuring his old father lived in comfort and the royal geese always had warm feet. As for the old grey hat, he kept it safe in a chest, for though he now understood much without it, he knew its worth. And he and the princess lived in great contentment for many long years.
