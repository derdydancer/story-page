The Cottager and the Devil's Spit
There was once a poor cottager who lived in a little hut with a broken shingle on the roof. When it rained, the water dripped onto his bed. He put an old bucket underneath to catch the drops, which went drip, drip, drip all night long. One stormy night, the Devil himself was flying past just overhead. A great gust of wind blew the broken shingle off the roof, and it struck the Devil smack on his left horn. The Devil was mightily angered, and rubbed his horn and looked down to see whence the offence had come. He saw the little hut below, and thought, "Aha, I shall spoil his water for that piece of impudence." So he flew down quickly and spat thrice into the cottager's water barrel that stood by the door. At once the good water turned green as grass and smelt like bad eggs. Next morning, the poor cottager went to get water to make his porridge, but the water was so foul he could not use it.
So he must needs go with his bucket to the nearest spring, which was a mile off through the woods. As he went through the woods, a great badger sat in the path and said, "Pay a berry for passage, or you go no farther." The cottager had a winter-berry in his pocket, so he gave it to the badger, who sniffed it and let him pass. He came at last to the clear spring bubbling amongst the rocks, and filled his bucket to the brim. But oh dear, on the way back, the bucket had sprung a leak near the bottom, and the water trickled out. He stuffed moss from a tree into the hole, which slowed the trickle but did not stop it quite. Now, it happened the King's daughter was riding through the woods with her ladies, and saw the poor man struggling with his leaky bucket. She laughed softly, for he looked a sight with moss sticking out of his bucket, and called out, "Good man, what ailes you?" "Alas, dear princess," answered the cottager, "my water barrel at home is foul beyond using, and now this bucket leaks besides." "Poor fellow," said the princess, "here, take this golden bucket from my saddle-bow; it is small, but it never leaks a drop."
The cottager could scarce believe his eyes, but he poured the water into the golden bucket and thanked her humbly. The princess smiled and rode on with her ladies, leaving him standing with the wondrous bucket. He went home marveling, the water safe within the golden bucket that shone like the sun. Now, the cottager had a neighbour, a farmer who was known to be greedy, and he saw the golden bucket through a crack in the fence. The neighbour came over the next day, pretending he wished to borrow an axe, but asked, "Friend, where did you get such a fine bucket?" The cottager, being simple and honest, told him truly how he had met the King's daughter in the woods, and how she gave it him for his need. The farmer's eyes glittered with greed, and he thought, "If that is how it is done, I shall get one too; I will make a hole in my own bucket and carry it past where the princess rides." So he went home and took his best bucket, and with his knife he made a neat hole in the bottom. Then he filled it at the spring and walked up and down the path where the princess might ride, letting the water leak out, and waited. Presently the princess came riding by again and saw the farmer with his leaking bucket, but this time she only laughed aloud and said, "Ho ho, master farmer! Are buckets catching the leaking sickness today?" and rode on.
The farmer got no golden bucket, and went home very angry, and blamed the poor cottager for his ill luck. The cottager, however, used the golden bucket daily, and found that whatever spring water he dipped with it, when he got home the bucket came up half full of gold coins along with the water. He soon grew rich enough from this to mend his roof properly with fine new shingles, and bought himself a goat and some warm boots. News of the cottager's sudden prosperity reached the King, who wondered greatly how a poor man could come by such means, and sent his guards to fetch him. The cottager was brought to the palace, and the King asked him sternly, "Fellow, how did you come by your gold? Tell me truly, or it shall go ill with you." The cottager, trembling a little, told him the whole story of the princess and the wondrous bucket given in the woods. The King commanded, "Show me this bucket!", and when the cottager showed it, the King saw it was indeed cunningly wrought of gold and gave off a faint light, and he said, "You are an honest fellow. You shall be Keeper of my Royal Spoons." The cottager agreed gladly, and so he went to live at the palace as Keeper of the Royal Spoons, which was a fine life. But the Devil saw all this from afar, and was vexed that his mischief with the water barrel had turned to such good fortune for the cottager. "Humph," thought the Devil, "Keeper of the Royal Spoons is he now? I must put a stop to this; I shall steal that leaky golden bucket."
That very night, when all were asleep, the Devil crept into the palace kitchen where the cottager now slept near his spoons. He looked about in the moonlight and quickly spied the little golden bucket gleaming softly beside the cottager's cot. But a little cricket that dwelt by the hearth saw the dark shape creeping near the bucket. Now, this cricket did not like the look of the sneaking Devil one bit, so it rubbed its legs together and chirped as loud as ever it could, which was surprisingly loud indeed. The Devil was so startled by this sudden loud chirping right near his ear that he jumped back and tripped over a three-legged stool, falling with a great clatter of pans. The clatter woke the cottager, who sat up and saw the Devil scrambling amongst the fallen pans in the moonlight. The cottager, though frightened, jumped up quick as thought, seized a sturdy broom from the corner, and struck the Devil soundly across the shoulders. The Devil let out a howl, more from surprise than pain, scrambled up, and fled up the chimney like smoke, leaving the golden bucket untouched. The King heard the howl and the clatter and came down with his guards to see what the matter was, and the cottager told him how the Devil had come to steal the bucket and how he had driven him off with a broom. The King was amazed at his courage and said, "Well struck, Spoon-Keeper! For driving off the Devil himself, you shall henceforth be Captain of my Royal Guard!"
So the poor cottager, who had started with naught but a hut with a broken shingle, became Captain of the Royal Guard, which was a very great honour indeed. He served the King well in this post, and was watchful and brave, and kept the palace safer than it had ever been. Now, the King's daughter often saw the brave Captain of the Guard, and she remembered the gardener's boy with the leaking bucket, and secretly she also remembered his splendid golden hair. The King, seeing his daughter was now of age, decided it was time she should wed, and he devised a trial for her suitors. He declared that whoever wished to marry the princess must first answer a riddle posed by none other than the Devil himself, whom the King commanded to appear for this task. Many proud princes and knights came to try, but when the Devil, grinning wickedly, posed his riddle, none could answer it right, and they were all sent away in disgrace. At last the Captain of the Guard, who had watched all this, came forward and said he too would try the riddle for the princess's hand. The Devil squinted at him and grinned, showing all his teeth, and said, "Aha, the broom-wielder! Very well, answer me this: What hit me on the horn, spoiled the water, leaked from the bucket, yet brought gold, guardship, and glory?" The Captain laughed, for he knew the answer well, and said clearly, "Why, that is naught but the poor cottager's broken roof shingle!" The Devil howled with rage to be beaten by the answer of a common roof shingle, and vanished in a puff of exceedingly ill-smelling yellow smoke.
The King declared, "Captain, you have answered rightly and well! You have won my daughter's hand." The Princess was overjoyed, and said, "Father, I would gladly wed the Captain, for I suspected he was more than he seemed since the day I saw his golden hair." So a great wedding feast was held, with music and dancing, and much rejoicing throughout the land. The greedy farmer neighbour was there too, watching all with envious eyes and muttering into his beard about the Captain's luck. An old man with eyes as bright as stars, who none knew save the Captain (for he thought he looked familiar), nodded wisely during the feast. The Captain, seeing the farmer's sour looks, thought it time the man learned a lesson about envy and leaky buckets. So he decreed that the farmer should henceforth have the task of carrying water for the royal cabbages, but only in buckets with holes deliberately drilled in the bottom. And this the farmer had to do every day, spilling most of the water before he reached the cabbage patch, so that everyone could see the fruit of his envy. But the Captain and the Princess lived happily and ruled wisely after the old King died, and thanks to the golden bucket and the King's favour, their roof never leaked again. And if they have not died, they are living there still; and the little cricket still chirps merrily on their hearth each night.
