The Princess and the Locked Book
A princess arrived at a great castle. A king ruled over this castle and the lands around. The king often watched all that happened in his court-yard from a high window. In the court-yard, three ladies in fine clothes held sway. They spoke little to others and turned their backs often. A second lady, who wore simpler garments, had once known their favor but no more. A stable boy was her only companion in the court. The second lady saw the princess arrive and said to her, 'Beware those three.' The stable boy added, 'Their words are like sharp pins.' The princess heard their counsel.
For three days, the princess walked in the court-yard and kept to the corners. The first lady, who seemed the leader of the three, watched the princess. On the fourth day, the first lady came near to where the princess stood. The first lady said, 'That is a simple frock you wear.' The princess answered, 'It is the one I possess.' Then the first lady said, 'Walk with us tomorrow.' The princess went and told the second lady and the stable boy of this. The second lady said, 'Go with them then, and learn their secrets.' The stable boy agreed, saying, 'That is wise counsel; find out all the unkind things they whisper.' The princess consented to this plan.
So the next day, the princess walked with the three ladies in the court-yard. They spoke of ribbons, and new jewels, and dances at court. The princess listened much and spoke little. Afterwards, the first lady took out a small, locked book from her sleeve. She unlocked it with a tiny key and wrote therein, and her companions added their own marks. They showed the book to the princess. The princess soon asked her father for finer clothes. The king granted this readily; his face shone like a polished skull when he saw her request. The second lady and the stable boy watched her new gowns arrive and did not look pleased. The princess now walked with them less often in the court-yard.
The princess remembered the counsel of her friends and one day told the first lady her head-dress was crooked. The first lady frowned and adjusted it quickly. When a visiting prince spoke only to the first lady, the princess spoke praise of the third lady's skill at embroidery. The prince then turned his conversation to the third lady for a time. The first lady looked sharply at the third lady after this, and spoke coolly to her. Many at court began to turn their eyes toward the princess more often now. The princess gave the first lady a sweet cake daily, saying it would make her eyes brighter, but it only made her gowns tight. The king watched the princess as she wore her fine clothes, and nodded slowly. The princess began to walk in the center of the court-yard. The second lady and the stable boy saw this and exchanged glances.
The first lady, whose gowns no longer fit, came to the princess and said, 'You gave me those cakes.' The princess replied, 'They were wholesome cakes, good for the constitution.' At the next feast, the princess took the highest seat at the table, which the first lady always claimed. The second and third ladies sat beside the princess and turned their faces from the first lady. The first lady sat alone at the far end of the table. The king watched this, and a smile touched his thin lips. The princess now held a gathering in her chambers but did not bid the second lady or the stable boy to come. They stood outside the door for a time and listened; their faces were grim. Inside, the princess herself now took out the small book and wrote sharp words within it. The princess and the second and third ladies laughed together.
The first lady, sitting alone, devised a plan concerning the locked book. By some means, she obtained the book while the princess was away. She added words to it, making it seem the princess had written many unkind words about the princess herself. Then she tore out many pages and scattered them through the court-yard. A great outcry arose as lords and ladies found the pages and read the sharp words written there. The king heard the noise and came down from his high window. He demanded, 'What is this clamor in my court?' The first lady showed the king the torn book and said, 'The princess wrote these things.' All turned to look upon the princess. She stood silent before the king and the court.
The king spoke then, his voice like chips of ice, 'You brought this discord to my court.' The princess opened her mouth to speak, but the king raised his hand. He declared, 'You shall work in the scullery with the lowest servants.' The second and third ladies stepped away from the princess's side. The second lady and the stable boy also turned their backs. She stood alone then, and walked towards the kitchens without a word. After she had gone, the king turned to the first lady. He said, 'You played your part well. The game is more amusing with fresh pieces.' The first lady smiled slightly and bowed her head. The king returned to his high window to watch the court-yard.
The scullery was dark and damp, and the princess scrubbed pots and carried ashes. For many days she worked from dawn till night. One evening, the second lady came to the scullery door. She looked upon the princess and said, 'You became like them.' The princess looked at her hands, which were covered in soot. She said only, 'The fault was mine.' The second lady then spoke quietly, 'The king watched it all. It was a game to him, like a puppet show.' The princess stood very still. After a moment, the second lady offered her a piece of bread. The princess took it.
They spoke together for a long time in the damp scullery and made a new plan. The locked book must be brought forth again, but shown for what it was. But the first lady kept it hidden now. The stable boy knew secret ways about the castle and found the book beneath a loose floorboard. He brought it to the princess, who took the book in her hands. At the next great feast, the princess stood forth before all. She held up the book and said, 'This book holds unkind words. Some were mine, when I forgot myself.' She looked then at the king and declared, 'And our king found amusement in this game of whispers and spite.' She then tore the pages from the book and let them fall. 'Let us speak plainly,' she said, 'or hold our peace.' A great silence fell upon the hall.
The king sat upon his throne and said nothing, his face like stone. The first lady was seen little at court after that day. The second and third ladies took up embroidery in a quiet chamber. The princess walked often again with the second lady and the stable boy. There was less whispering in the court-yard thereafter, and more plain speech. The princess sometimes wore simple frocks, and sometimes finer gowns, and walked where she pleased. The king still watched from his high window, but his face remained like stone. Princes who visited the court spoke with her plainly. The princess learned much and found a measure of peace in the castle. And there she likely dwells still.
