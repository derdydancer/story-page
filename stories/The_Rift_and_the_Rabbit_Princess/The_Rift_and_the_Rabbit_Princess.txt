The Rift and the Rabbit Princess
There once lived a king and queen who ruled their kingdom justly, and all went well within its borders. The king had two sons; the elder had a wicked heart, but the younger son was good and kind to all creatures. One day, without warning, the earth groaned terribly, and a great rift opened up in the land, splitting it from end to end. The king stood upon one side of the deep chasm, and alas, the queen stood weeping upon the other. Both the king's sons were with their father on the king's side of the rift. The king ordered his men to fell great trees and build a bridge across the chasm, that he might reach his dear queen. But though they laboured hard each day, each night what was built of the bridge was thrown down into the darkness below, and no man knew how. Then the elder son said to the king, "Father, this is strange work; let us keep watch by night to see who hinders us. I myself will watch first." The king thought this wise, and agreed. So when night fell, the elder son went to the half-built bridge with his sword. But presently, the Devil came by, disguised as a cheerful old man with a flask of wine, and offered the prince a drink; the prince drank deeply, fell fast asleep, and the bridge was thrown down as before.
In the morning, the elder son awoke, found the bridge destroyed, and went to the king saying, "Alas, father, a great shaking of the earth threw down the timbers." The next night, the good younger son said, "Father, perhaps I might keep watch tonight." The king agreed, but the elder brother laughed aloud, saying, "What can you do, little fool, where I have failed?" The younger son said nothing, but when night fell, he took his sword, and also a crust of bread and a flask of water, and went to the bridge. Presently, the same cheerful old man came by with his flask, and offered the younger son a drink of wine. "Thank you kindly, good sir," said the younger son, "but I have water here, and desire nothing more tonight." The Devil scowled, stamped his foot, and seeing the prince would not be tempted, he went to the bridge timbers and began to hack at them with a great axe. Then the younger son drew his sword and ran towards him, crying, "Hold, villain! Do not dare destroy the king's bridge!" The Devil gave a great shriek and vanished like smoke, but left behind him on the ground a single black feather from his hidden wing. The younger son picked up the feather, kept safe watch until morning, and for the first time, the bridge was not harmed.
In the morning, the younger son went to the king, told him all that had passed, and showed him the black feather as proof that it was the work of the Devil. The king rejoiced greatly and praised his younger son, but the elder son stood by silent and full of envy and hatred. The king's men worked again on the bridge, but the younger son had carelessly left the feather lying on a timber, and soon three workmen who touched it found themselves stuck fast and could not move. The elder son saw this, and stepping forward, he said cunningly, "Father, I know a secret word to release them, taught to me by an old hermit in the woods." He went near, pretended to whisper a word in each man's ear, but truly only touched them with his gloved hand, and they were instantly freed. The king was amazed at this magic, praised the elder son greatly, and now thought him wiser than before, so that the younger son's brave watch seemed less important. Soon afterwards, the bridge was finished, and the elder son took much credit for its speedy making. The king prepared to cross the bridge the very next morning, taking both his sons with him to greet the queen. But as they reached the middle of the bridge, high above the darkness, the wicked elder son, unseen by the king, gave his younger brother a mighty push. The younger son fell down, down into the darkness of the chasm, and the king knew nothing of his brother's evil deed.
When the king and his elder son reached the other side, the queen ran to meet them, but then asked, "Where is your brother, my dear younger son?" The elder son began shedding false tears and said, "Alas, Mother, he grew dizzy on the high bridge, slipped, and fell into the darkness before I could catch him!" The king and queen mourned their good son bitterly, believing the elder son's words, for he seemed truly sorrowful. But the younger son did not perish, for as he fell, the Devil himself, dwelling in the rift, caught him in his arms. The Devil laughed, showing his sharp teeth, and said, "You are too good a morsel to lose; I shall not harm you now, but you must serve me for seven years." What else could the poor prince do? He agreed to serve the Devil for seven years, hoping for eventual release. The Devil set him to work at once, which was merely to keep great fires burning day and night beneath bubbling black cauldrons. "One thing only I forbid," warned the Devil, shaking a long finger, "Do not ever lift the lids of these cauldrons to see what boils within, or it will be the worse for you." So the years went by, six years and many months, and the younger son was faithful and kept the fires burning brightly, never once looking under the lids. Then one day, when his time was almost done, the Devil went out on some wicked business, leaving the prince quite alone with the fires and the cauldrons.
Curiosity burned hotter in the prince than the flames he tended; "I must look, just once," he thought, and carefully lifted the edge of one heavy cauldron lid. Inside, bubbling fiercely, was not pitch or brimstone, but pure gold, shining brightly even in the gloom. Astonished, he quickly looked into the second cauldron, and there bubbled pure silver, gleaming like moonlight. He hurried to the third cauldron, expecting perhaps jewels, but inside was only a little white rabbit, hopping about anxiously and looking most unhappy. The rabbit stopped hopping and spoke in a small, sad voice, "Kind sir, have pity! I am a princess from a lost kingdom, enchanted by the Devil who keeps me boiling here, though by good fortune the water never harms me." The prince's heart was moved with pity, and he said at once, "Fear not, little rabbit, I will save you from this dreadful place." "Quickly then," urged the rabbit-princess, "Take the Devil's fastest walking-boots from behind the door, put me in your pocket, and flee while he is still away!" The prince wasted no time; he found the boots, which looked quite ordinary, tucked the little rabbit safely into his pocket, and put on the boots. The boots felt wonderfully light, and he took one step, then two, then three, and with each stride he covered many leagues, hardly touching the ground until he stood once more at the edge of the great rift. Just then, the Devil returned, saw the empty workplace and the missing boots, sniffed the air, and roared with fury to find the prince and his little rabbit prize gone.
The prince stood by the great rift, the little rabbit trembling in his pocket, and wondered how to cross, remembering the Devil's black feather he still carried. He took out the feather, half fearing it, and experimentally touched it to the stone edge of the chasm. Instantly, where the feather touched, there sprang forth a narrow bridge made of something like black smoke or shadow, yet solid enough to walk upon, reaching to the far side. Holding the rabbit safe, the prince crossed over quickly on this strange, dark bridge, which vanished the moment he reached the other side. He found himself standing by a clear stream in a part of the kingdom he knew, and the rabbit whispered from his pocket, "Pray, sprinkle three drops of water upon my head." He did so, taking water in his hand, and as the third drop fell, the rabbit vanished, and before him stood a princess more beautiful than any he had ever seen. She thanked him sweetly, but said, "Brave prince, I must now seek my own lost land and people; yet know that I shall not forget your kindness, and we may meet again." And with that, she gave him a kind look, and seemed to fade into the bright sunlight, leaving him standing alone by the stream. The prince thought it wise not to reveal himself at once at his father's court, so he muddied his clothes and appeared at the palace gate as a simple traveller seeking rest. He was let in, for the palace gates were never shut to travellers, but was given only a place to sleep on the straw in the stables, which suited his plan well enough.
From the stables, the returned prince could watch the goings-on of the court, and saw how his elder brother strutted about proudly, and was often cruel to the servants. One morning, a little grey bird flew to the queen's window and sang a strange little song: "The good prince lives, though far he fell, / The wicked brother knows this well!" The queen heard the song and was greatly troubled in her heart, though she did not know what to make of it, nor where the bird came from. Every day the bird returned and sang its song, and soon the wicked elder son heard it too as he passed, and grew fearful that his secret might be discovered. He took a crossbow and waited in hiding, and when the little bird came to sing, he shot at it, hoping to silence it forever. But the arrow missed the bird, flying past it and striking instead an old stone gargoyle carved above the queen's window. The stone of the gargoyle's head became loose from the blow, and tilted forward, showing a dark hollow place behind it within the wall. The younger prince, watching from his hiding place in the stables, saw all this happen: the bird's escape, the arrow hitting the stone face, and the stone tilting forward. The elder son, unaware of the hollow place and only vexed that he missed the bird, cursed his bad luck and went away from the window. The younger prince resolved that night, when all were asleep, he would climb up to the queen's window and see what lay hidden behind the stone gargoyle.
When midnight came and the palace was quiet, the prince crept out and climbed the wall by means of the thick ivy, until he reached the queen's window and the tilted gargoyle. He reached into the darkness behind the stone and his fingers felt not emptiness, but an old casket, bound with iron and locked fast. Having no key, the prince wondered if the Devil's feather held more magic; he took it out and touched the tip lightly to the iron lock. With a faint click, but no noise to wake the sleeping queen within, the heavy iron lock sprang open beneath the feather's touch. Inside the casket lay not gold nor jewels, but old, yellowed letters and pacts, written in the elder son's own hand, showing how he had bargained with the Devil to cause the great rift, hoping to gain the whole kingdom for himself. The prince's blood ran cold as he read, but he quickly took the wicked letters and climbed back down, hiding them safely, determined now to expose his brother's villainy. But the elder son, still uneasy about the bird and the moving gargoyle, grew more fearful each day, and secretly hired a poor woodsman, promising him gold to kill the simple traveller sleeping in the stables that very night. The woodsman crept into the stables in the dark, but being a clumsy fellow unused to such work, he tripped over a bucket and knocked down a cage wherein hung the king's prize talking parrot. The parrot, startled from sleep, squawked loudly, "Gold for the woodsman! Kill the traveller! Gold for the woodsman! Kill the traveller!" repeating the last words it had overheard the elder prince mutter that day. The prince awoke at the noise, heard the parrot's words, and understood his peril just as the woodsman scrambled up; but the woodsman heard the parrot too, thought the whole court was aroused, and turned and fled into the night.
The prince knew the time had come; he had the letters proving his brother caused the rift, and now the parrot had revealed the plot against his own life. The next morning, he went before the king and queen in the great hall, no longer disguised, and revealed his face, telling them he had survived the fall. The king and queen were overjoyed, wept tears of happiness, and embraced their dear son whom they had mourned as dead. Then, gently, the younger prince laid the wicked letters and pacts he had found behind the gargoyle before them. The king read the letters, his face grew hard as stone, and his eyes cold as ice, as he understood his elder son's terrible treason. He sent guards to fetch the elder son, who came proudly before his father, expecting praise, unaware that his wickedness was known. The king looked at him steadily and said, "Son, I have discovered a great evil in my kingdom: a man high in trust who bargained with the Devil, caused the great rift, and plotted his own brother's death. What doom does such a traitor deserve?" The elder son, thinking only of some secret enemy and wishing to appear sternly just, replied at once, "Such a vile traitor, Sire, deserves nothing less than to be sealed in a barrel lined with sharp spikes inside and out, and cast into the swiftest part of the river!" "Then you are the traitor!" roared the king, rising to his feet, "For these letters prove your guilt! Guards, seize him! You have declared your own doom! Let it be done as you have said!" The wicked prince cried out and struggled, but the guards dragged him away to meet the very fate he had devised for another.
From that day forward, a marvel occurred: the great rift in the land began slowly to close, its edges drawing together inch by inch. Not long after, the beautiful princess from the lost kingdom came riding to the court on a fine white horse, seeking the brave prince who had freed her. There was great joy when she and the good younger prince met again, for they were happily reunited at last. The prince, seeing she looked upon him kindly, took courage and asked her to be his wife. The princess laughed happily and gladly consented, for she had thought of him often since her rescue. A great wedding feast was held, lasting seven days, with music and rejoicing throughout the land, for the kingdom was healing. On the last day of the feast, the earth gave a gentle sigh, and the rift closed entirely, so the king and queen could embrace once more upon solid ground. It was known to all that the good prince and his fair princess would rule the kingdom wisely after the old king and queen. Deep below the earth, it is said, the Devil howled in rage to lose his prize and his power over the land, but could do no more harm there. And the good prince and his princess, with the old king and queen, lived happily together in the healed kingdom to the end of their days.
