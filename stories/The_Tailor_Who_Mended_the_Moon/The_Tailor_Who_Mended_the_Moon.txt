The Tailor Who Mended the Moon
There once was a tailor, known through three villages for his nimble fingers, but also for his boastful tongue.
"There is naught I cannot mend!" he would declare in the inn. "A torn stocking, a ripped sail, aye, even a crack in the king's crown, if need be!"
One night, as the tailor boasted thus, a little imp with eyes like sparks and ears like bat wings perched unseen on the windowsill.
The imp grinned, showing needle-sharp teeth.
"Mend anything, can he?" the imp whispered to itself. "We shall see!"
The imp flew up, up, up into the night sky, higher than any bird.
It carried a pair of tiny, wickedly sharp scissors made of shadow and spite.
When it reached the full moon, shining bright and round, the imp snipped a jagged little hole right near the edge!
A tiny sliver of moonlight fell down to earth like a dropped coin.
The next morning, people looked up and gasped.
"Look! The moon is torn!" they cried.
There was indeed a small, dark hole in the otherwise perfect moon.
Panic spread.
Would the sky unravel?
Would the stars fall out?
Soon, the talk reached the tailor.
The villagers gathered at his shop.
"Tailor," said the mayor, "you boasted you could mend anything! Look, the moon is torn! You must fix it, or we shall run you out of town for a boastful fool!"
The tailor went pale.
He looked up at the hole in the moon.
He had only meant he was good with cloth!
But his pride would not let him admit it.
"Of course, I can mend it," he stammered. "A simple tear. Needs... needs a sturdy patch."
But how to reach the moon?
He climbed the church steeple, but the moon was still far away.
He tried to fly a kite with a needle and thread attached, but the thread broke.
He despaired.
Then, sitting glumly in his shop, he noticed his biggest spool of the strongest, silver thread he used for noblemen's coats.
An idea sparked, as foolish as his boast.
"If I cannot climb to the moon," he thought, "perhaps I can pull the moon to me!"
He took the spool of silver thread outside.
He fashioned a tiny, perfect loop at one end.
Then, with a mighty heave, borrowing the technique of lads throwing stones, he flung the loop up towards the moon.
Once, twice, three times he threw.
On the third try, helped perhaps by a mischievous breeze (or the imp wanting more fun), the silver loop caught neatly around the jagged edge of the hole in the moon!
The tailor gasped.
It had worked!
Now, he tied the other end of the thread firmly to the village well-head, the strongest thing he could find.
He pulled.
Nothing happened.
He got three stout men to help him pull.
The thread held, but the moon did not budge.
"We need more pull!" cried the tailor, caught up in his own absurdity.
He ran about the village.
"Everyone! Come pull the moon!"
The villagers, bewildered but desperate, came.
Men, women, children, they all took hold of the silver thread.
"Heave!" cried the tailor.
They heaved.
The thread stretched taut, humming like a bowstring.
But the moon stayed stubbornly in the sky.
High above, the imp watched and giggled, shaking its shadowy sides.
Suddenly, the oldest woman in the village, Granny Willow, hobbled forward.
"You fools," she cackled, tapping the taut thread. "Pulling the moon down? You'll pull the well-head up first! You need to *climb* the thread, tailor!"
The tailor stared at the thin silver thread stretching impossibly up into the sky.
Climb *that*?
But all eyes were on him.
Taking a deep breath, and knotting the thread around his waist, he began to climb, hand over hand, like a spider on its silk.
Up and up he went, the village shrinking below.
The air grew thin.
He climbed through clouds.
At last, heart pounding, he reached the edge of the moon.
It felt cool and smooth, like polished bone.
He pulled himself onto its surface.
The hole was right there, a clean snip through the moonlight.
He took out his strongest needle and a patch cut from his own silver waistcoat lining.
Sitting cross-legged on the moon, the little tailor carefully stitched the patch over the hole.
His stitches were neat and tiny, the best work he had ever done.
When he finished, the patch blended in perfectly.
The hole was gone.
He looked down.
How to return?
The thread stretched below him, impossibly thin.
Just then, the imp appeared beside him, holding the shadow scissors.
"Well done, tailor," it snickered. "You mended it indeed."
And with a snip, the imp cut the silver thread near the moon.
"Hey!" cried the tailor as the thread fell away.
He was stranded!
But as he watched the thread fall, it seemed to catch on a passing cloud.
And then another cloud below that.
And another.
It formed a soft, cloud-like ladder reaching down, down, down.
The imp winked and vanished.
Carefully, the tailor climbed down the cloud-ladder.
He stepped off the last cloud onto the church steeple, then climbed down to the cheering villagers below.
He was hailed as a hero, the Tailor Who Mended the Moon.
He never boasted quite so loudly again, but he did sometimes tell the tale, leaving out the part about pulling on the well-head.
And some say, if you look very closely at the full moon, you can still see the faint outline of the tailor's silver patch.
