The Swan with Black Feathers
There lived once a swan in a reedy marsh, and each morn when he awoke, he found one new black feather upon his white wing, which gave him great trouble. His wife, who preened herself nearby, said only, 'It is but a feather, and a small one at that.' The swan plucked it out, and tried to hide it under a stone, but before he had smoothed his other feathers, another black one grew straightway in its place. Their little ones, meanwhile, tumbled about the messy nest, untidy and peeping thinly, for neither parent had yet brought them fresh reeds or morning grubs. 'Today,' said the swan, looking at the black feather with a sigh, 'I shall build a new nest, stronger and finer than any in this marsh.' 'That is too much work,' said his wife, fluffing her feathers, 'and the sun is pleasant here by the old water-lily.' So the swan set off alone to gather stout reeds and soft down, though the many black feathers now made one wing heavy, and his flight was lopsided. Not far from where he searched, a blind mole had dug his hole carelessly near the water's edge, patting the loose earth with his paws. As the swan bent to pull a particularly fine reed, the blind mole, sensing a tremor, pushed a large clod of mud from his doorway, which caused the swan to slip and drop his hard-won bundle. The swan returned with but three reeds as dusk fell, his heavy wing aching, to find his wife still preening and the little ones crying for food.
The next morn, the sun rose on yet another black feather, and the swan saw that his wing drooped lower still. 'Perhaps if you hide it under your other wing, no one will notice,' said his wife, pecking idly at a water snail. The swan ignored her, for the sight of his drooping wing filled him with a dull ache, and said, 'Today, I must find food, for the little ones are thin.' He beat the air with great effort, for his wings were now sorely unbalanced, and he flew crookedly, like a wounded bird, towards the muddy shallows where fat grubs might be found. The blind mole, digging vigorously for roots nearby, sent a shower of dark earth and wriggling grubs flying into the air just as the swan landed heavily. The swan, startled, snatched at the scattered grubs as best he could, his fine white feathers becoming draggled with mud in his haste. Below him, in the disturbed earth, two earthworms poked out their heads and whispered one to another, 'A heavy price for a light step, indeed.' The swan heard their faint murmur but paid them no mind, for his beak was full and his wing ached more than ever. He made his way back to the nest and fed the little ones the few muddy grubs, while his wife watched from her sunny spot by the water-lily. The little ones ate greedily, but they still looked small for their age and their down was thin in places.
Another dawn, more black feathers, and this time the swan cried out, for they appeared now on both wings, and he found he could scarcely lift himself from the ground. 'Perhaps the water is too dark here,' said his wife, squinting at her reflection. 'Clearer water might make for whiter feathers.' The swan, with a heavy heart which the story does not mention, said, 'Today, before I lose all flight, I shall teach the little ones to swim.' He half-hopped, half-flapped towards the water's edge, the little ones trailing uncertainly behind him, pecking at his dark-tipped tail feathers. Just as they reached the bank, the earth beneath the mole's carelessly dug tunnel, weakened by the damp, gave way with a soft sigh, and two of the cygnets tumbled into the collapsing muddy pit. The swan flapped uselessly with his heavy, darkened wings, trying to reach them, but he could not gain purchase on the crumbling edge, and his wife, at that moment, was nowhere to be seen. 'Ah, the scent of fine truffles!' mumbled the blind mole from deeper in his ruined burrow, mistaking the cygnets' frightened peeps for something delicious. The earthworms below, however, poked out their heads once more and sang in a low chorus, 'When wings grow black, for duties slack, the pit claims its own, and a father's groan.' The swan heard them this time, and as the last soft crumbling of earth sealed the pit, he could do naught but watch, his own black feathers seeming to drag him to the ground. Then his wife ambled over, looked at the disturbed earth, and said with a frown, 'Such a mess, it has quite spoiled my lovely view of the water-lilies.'
When the next day dawned, the black feathers on the swan's wings were thick as a crow's, and flight was now a memory he could only sorrowfully recall. 'Husband,' said his wife, polishing a stray white feather of her own, 'fetch me that particularly shiny pebble from the far bank; it would look well in the nest I hope you soon finish.' The swan looked at his useless wings, then at his wife, and with a great effort, began to waddle and drag himself towards the far bank, a sorry sight for any creature to behold. The blind mole, whose hearing was sharp, was busy clearing a new blockage in his tunnel and called out, 'Some folk take all day to cross a simple patch of mud, humming a tune to himself.' It took him till noon to reach the far bank, his once-white breast now mud-caked, his breath coming in ragged gasps as he searched for the shiny stone. He found a pebble, no shinier than any other, but when he tried to pick it up, he found he was too weak from his journey to carry it properly in his beak. And from the earth beside him, the two worms emerged again, and they sang clearly, 'A vow ignored, a mate deplored, brings feathers of night, and ends all flight.' The swan heard these words clearly, and a great shudder went through him, so much so that he let the pebble fall from his clumsy beak. He returned to the nest with nothing, his body trembling, to find his wife attempting to chase a brightly coloured dragonfly that flitted over the water. The swan sat heavily by the messy, unfinished nest, the black feathers a heavy cloak upon him, and the worms' song echoing in his troubled mind.
On the morrow, the swan did not even attempt to count the new black feathers that covered him almost entirely like a sooty shroud; his wings were like lead. 'Since you are so dark now,' his wife observed, stirring the muddy water with her beak, 'perhaps you should wallow in the black mud of the far shallows; then all your feathers might at least match.' The swan looked at her and said, with a voice rough from disuse, 'And yet our nest remains half-built, and the shiny pebble unretrieved.' 'It is rather draughty,' she replied, shivering delicately though the sun was warm, 'and I have quite lost my appetite for dragonflies.' Meanwhile, the blind mole, convinced that winter was arriving early, was diligently pushing a small mountain of pebbles and smooth stones towards the entrance of his precarious burrow for insulation. One particularly large stone, dislodged by his efforts, rolled down and caused a small landslide from the bank, further narrowing the swans' path to the deeper water. The swan, watching the pebbles scatter, thought not of his wife's desired stone, but only that the path was now obstructed, and said quietly, 'I will clear that much, at least.' He pushed with his breast against one of the smaller fallen stones, then nudged it with his beak, and strained with his legs, but moved it but an inch. The earthworms, witnessing his struggle, sang a new, softer tune: 'The root of the trouble lies not in the stone, but in vision lost and a truth unknown; seek the deep root, with eyes of true sight, to turn back the dark and restore the light.' The swan gave up the effort, his head drooping against his black-feathered breast, and the earthworms' song about a 'root' and 'true sight' remained with him as the light faded.
Dawn arrived, and the swan looked upon himself in the still water; no white feather remained, and he was entirely black, more like a great, clumsy crow than a swan of the reeds. His wife, seeing him thus, cried out in fright and scuttled away to the furthest clump of reeds, saying, 'You are no swan of mine! Keep away from me, dark creature!' Left alone, the black swan felt a dull curiosity and began to stumble towards the mole's ruined burrow, for there was nowhere else that seemed to draw him. He found the blind mole within, humming cheerlessly as he attempted to sort his collection of pebbles into three distinct piles based on imagined smoothness. The black swan watched this for a time, then, with the tip of one black wing, he idly nudged the three piles so that many pebbles rolled together again. 'My pebbles! My beautiful, sorted pebbles!' wailed the blind mole, flailing his paws in the air. 'A lifetime of careful judgment, ruined, all ruined!' At this, the two earthworms, who seemed to be able to travel anywhere beneath the soil, poked their heads through the floor of the mole's burrow and sang, 'Pebble judgment, light and small, counts for naught when shadows fall; only by the heart's true measure, is revealed life's lasting treasure.' The black swan heard this, and the phrase 'heart's true measure' struck him, and he looked down at his own black breast as if seeing it for the first time. Then, with a strange, harsh cry that was not a swan's call nor a crow's caw, he pecked hard at his own black-feathered breast, once, twice. And where he had pecked, not blood, but one tiny, almost invisible, new white feather, like a fleck of snow, began to push through the black.
The black swan stared and stared at this tiny white fleck upon his breast, too astonished to move or make a sound. His wife, hearing his earlier strange cry, cautiously approached him from behind a clump of ferns, but she saw only his blackness and the way he hunched over himself. 'There is no use moping like a wet hen, even if you are a black one,' she said sharply. 'The sun is high, and I desire some tender water-shoots for my luncheon.' The black swan did not look up, but with the very tip of his black beak, he touched the tiny white feather as if it were the most delicate thing in the world. Just then, the blind mole, having decided his old burrow was too draughty after all the collapses, tunnelled experimentally upwards and bumped his nose against the black swan's leg, crying, 'Aha! A fine, sturdy tree root for my new ceiling support!' Startled, the black swan hopped back a step, and as his black breast feathers ruffled, the tiny white feather was joined by two or three more, making a small, distinct patch. 'Curious!' muttered the mole, feeling the 'root' shift. 'This root seems curiously mobile!' And he began to pat earth firmly around the swan's feet to secure it. From a fresh molehill nearby, the earthworms lifted their heads and sang with unusual sweetness, 'One black spot, a truth forgot; but white may bloom, dispelling gloom, if heart's true gift, freely given, lifts the sorrow up to heaven.' The black swan, his feet now uncomfortably packed with earth by the diligent mole, heard the worms' new song and looked across the reeds towards his wife, who was now trying to catch a water beetle. The small patch of white feathers on his breast seemed to pulse faintly as he pondered the meaning of a 'heart's true gift,' while his wife finally caught the beetle with a triumphant splash.
As he sat, the image of the worms' 'heart's true gift' brought a painful memory to the black swan: a promise made long ago to his first wife, before she vanished in a great storm, concerning their last, precious egg hidden in the deepest reeds. He had hidden it well when the storm threatened, meaning to return at once, but then his grief had clouded his mind, and with his new, foolish wife, he had forgotten all about it. 'The egg!' he croaked, the sound raw with dawning understanding. 'The gift must be to find and care for our lost egg!' His wife, who had tired of beetle-chasing, paddled closer and asked, 'An egg, did you say? For me? Oh, I do hope it is fresh for my breakfast.' The black swan ignored her and, with renewed, desperate strength, struggled to rise on his earth-packed feet, his gaze fixed on the tangled growth of the deepest reeds at the marsh's far end. The mole, exclaiming, 'This root is most uncooperative!' gave a great heave on what he thought was a loose fibre, which was in fact a stray black feather near the swan's foot, dislodging some of the packed earth as the swan pulled away. This loosening of the earth around his feet gave the black swan enough purchase to begin his slow and painful journey towards the far reeds, his dark plumage now seeming less a shroud and more a pilgrim's somber cloak. The earthworms, sensing his changed course, sang from the muddy bank he left behind, 'From bitter root, a fragile shoot; if lost is found, on sacred ground, then hope may spring, and new birds sing.' His wife, seeing him actually leaving, called out in annoyance, 'Well, if you are going all that way, do not forget my shiny pebble this time!' But the black swan did not reply nor look back; he had a promise to keep, and the memory of a tiny white feather against his dark breast spurred him onward into the deepest, most tangled part of the marsh.
After many hours of painful searching through tangled roots and sharp reeds, the black swan came to a part of the marsh he vaguely remembered; it was overgrown and thorny, and the place looked ill-favoured. He pushed through the thorns which tore at his black feathers, showing raw skin beneath, and where the skin was touched by his true grief and effort, more small white feathers were now clearly visible upon his breast. Suddenly, from a mound of disturbed earth nearby, the blind mole's voice grumbled, 'Too many roots in this part of the marsh! And the pebbles are all jagged here, entirely unsuitable for proper insulation!' He gave an angry shove with his snout to a particularly stubborn root, and as it tore free, it revealed a small, dry hollow beneath, and in that hollow lay one large, pale egg, still whole. The black swan let out a cry, a sound no longer harsh, but filled with a terrible, breaking joy, and he stumbled towards the hollow, his dark eyes fixed on the treasure. As he gently touched the cool, smooth shell with his beak, a great drift of black feathers fell from his body to the ground, and his wings, when he hesitantly stretched them, were now more white than black. 'Hark!' cried the mole, mistaking the swan's emotional cries and the rustle of falling feathers for an approaching predator. 'A fox or a weasel, I'll be bound! You noisy root, you will be the death of us all!' But the earthworms, now appearing beside the revealed egg, sang a triumphant yet cautionary tune, 'A promise kept, the white has swept, through darkest night, restoring light! Yet balance true, for old and new, may hang upon one feather's weight, to seal thy fate.' The swan, now more white than black, carefully took the precious egg in his beak and, with a surge of clumsy but strong wing-beats, lifted himself into the air and flew slowly towards his old, messy nest. As he flew, a few remaining black feathers still dotted his wings, and he wondered what 'one feather's weight' the earthworms had meant, the pale egg held gently and safely.
He landed by the messy nest where his wife was attempting to spear a small fish with a sharp reed; she looked up, her eyes widened at his mostly white plumage and then at the large, pale egg he carefully set down. The swan looked from the egg to his wife, then at the few stubborn black feathers still upon his own wings, and the worms' words about 'one feather's weight' echoed in his mind. He then gently but firmly nudged the egg with his white breast towards the very centre of the messy, half-built nest, covering it slightly with a few dry reeds he found there. 'Well!' huffed his wife, dropping her fishing-reed. 'If that egg is not for eating soon, nor for looking pretty, then I daresay this whole marsh is a disappointment, and I shall find a gander with a proper sense of style!' At her very words, the blind mole, who had been diligently piling wet mud and heavy pebbles around where the swan's leg *had* been, suddenly cried in triumph, 'There, solid as a mountain!' – and that entire section of the bank, overburdened and undermined, slid with a great sigh into the water. The wife, who had been standing right on that precarious edge during her pronouncement, squawked in surprise as she, the half-speared fish, and her sharp reed all tumbled into the muddy water with a loud splash. The swan, now almost entirely white, watched her spluttering indignation, and as he did, the very last, stubborn black feather at the tip of his right wing loosened and floated away on the breeze. The earthworms, witnessing this, rose higher than ever from the soil and sang with great feeling, 'The vow renewed, the past subdued! The true mate sought is the hope unbought! Let style be drowned, where truth is crowned, and a father's care finds all things fair!' The swan, now fully white and strong of wing, stretched his pinions wide. He looked at the precious egg in the nest, then at his wife who was clambering indignantly onto a slippery log, and then up at the wide, open sky. Then, with a sound like rushing wind, he beat his great, white wings once, twice, and the air thrummed with the promise of his flight, though where he would first direct it, only the silent reeds seemed to know.
