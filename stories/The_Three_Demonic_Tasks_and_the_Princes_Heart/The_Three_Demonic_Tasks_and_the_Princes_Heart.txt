The Three Demonic Tasks and the Prince's Heart
Chapter 1
He knew not what to do, for how could he harm the princess who, despite her earlier mischief with the cook's mice, had looked upon his revealed golden hair with such open admiration? Yet, even as he despaired, he recalled the old woman's gnarled apple and her words: "Plant its seeds where sorrow is greatest, and see what grows." The queen swooned dead away upon hearing this, and the youth felt a despair colder than the Frost Giant's breath, for he knew he loved the princess more than life itself. That very night, the demonic servant appeared once more, its eyes gleaming with malice, and announced the third and final task: "Your champion must bring us the heart of the one he loves most in all the world, still beating on a silver platter." The king's brother, however, when he heard of this success, only smiled a thin, cold smile and said, "Two tasks are done. One, the most delightful, yet remains." Back in the kingdom, he presented the Sun's Tear to his mother the queen, and as its light touched her, the terrible black feather on her windowsill crumbled to dust, and a measure of peace returned to her face. He slid and tumbled down the Glass Mountain, the Sun's Tear clutched tight, its light now softened to a gentle glow, and landed in a heap at the bottom, bruised but triumphant. The youth snatched the Sun's Tear, which burned his palm like a brand, and fled the ice castle as the blind Frost Giant awoke with a roar that shook the Glass Mountain to its foundations. Just as the last link parted, one of the Giant's eyelids twitched, and a low growl rumbled in his chest. With his silver knife, he carefully began to cut the links of the chain of frozen tears, each snap sounding as loud as thunder in the silent hall.
Chapter 2
Around the Giant's thick neck, on a chain of frozen tears, hung a single, dazzling droplet that pulsed with the light of a captive sunrise – the Sun's own Tear. He slipped inside the ice castle, which was strangely silent, and found the Frost Giant snoring loudly in a vast hall, his breath like a winter storm. Step by step, melting his way upwards, he climbed for a whole day and a night, until he reached the summit where a castle of jagged ice stood, home of the blind Frost Giant. As he wondered how to begin, the silver knife hummed, and when he touched its point to the glassy surface, it melted a small, secure step into the mountain. He finally reached the base of the Glass Mountain, which was so slick that not even a fly could find footing, and so tall its peak was lost in the clouds. The youth, remembering the playful princess and her mouse, managed to tell three jokes so terrible that the squirrels rolled about in fits of laughter and forgot to hold the bridge steady, very nearly dropping him into the treacle. The journey was long, and he had to cross a river of treacle by balancing on a bridge made of argumentative squirrels who demanded payment in well-told jokes. With this silver knife and the stone from the Well, he set out for the distant Glass Mountain, a place few had seen and from which none had ever returned. He touched a silver leaf from the joyful tree, and it detached itself and became a small, sharp knife in his hand, humming with a faint warmth.
Chapter 3
The youth, hearing of this new demand from his grieving mother, knew that the king's brother hoped for his demise on this impossible quest. Then the servant of The Devil reappeared to the queen, this time with a smirk, and announced the second task: "Your champion must steal the Sun's own Tear from the hoard of the blind Frost Giant who lives on the Glass Mountain." He sent soldiers to chop down the tree, but their axes shattered against its silvery bark as if striking diamond. News of this marvel quickly reached the king's brother, who was greatly displeased, for joy was contrary to his designs. Instantly, a wondrous tree sprang up, with leaves of silver and fruit like laughing children's faces, and its scent drove away all despair from that small courtyard. He had no water, so he pricked his own thumb with a thorn and let three drops of his own blood fall upon the soil where the seeds lay. There, with the smooth stone from the Well still warm in one pocket, he planted the five gnarled seeds from the old woman's apple. Remembering the old woman, the youth sought out the most barren and sorrowful place in the city – the orphans' empty playground behind the crumbling poorhouse. He reached the capital to find the city subdued and fearful, for the king's brother had imposed harsh new taxes and punishments in the king's name.
Chapter 4
The old woman blessed him for his kindness and gave him a curious, gnarled apple, saying, "Plant its seeds where sorrow is greatest, and see what grows." The youth, though he had little, gave her the last of his stale bread and promised to look into the matter if ever he returned to the capital. He soon came upon an old woman weeping by a barren field, whose only cow, she said, had been unjustly seized for the king's (or rather, the king's brother's) larders. He took the small stone, which now pulsed with a gentle warmth in his hand, and began the long journey down from the Howling Peaks. The youth felt a great weariness leave him, yet he knew this was but the first of three burdens laid upon his house. With his words, the murmurs in the Well ceased, the darkness in the pit lessened, and a soft, clear light emanated from its depths. He rose and declared, "It is a Story, that speaks without voice and tells of all things yet remains itself!" As he prayed, the withered bone in his belt grew warm, and a thought, clear as a bird's song, came to him. He knelt upon the stony ground and prayed to God, who alone knows all secrets, to grant him understanding.
Chapter 5
The youth felt sweat upon his brow; his mind was blank, and he feared his ears would soon be homes to angry bees. The murmurs from the Well grew louder for a moment, then the voice said, "One remains. Third: I have no voice, yet I speak to all; I have no body, but I make men weep or rejoice; I tell of beginnings and endings, but I myself never change. What am I?" "That is Tomorrow," he answered, a little less certain than before. This riddle gave him more pause, and he gazed up at the three-eyed raven, which still circled, as if waiting. A low rumble came from the Well, and the voice spoke again, "Clever enough. Now, second: I am always coming, but never arrive; I am always present, but ever depart. What am I?" "You speak of a map," he said at last, his voice steady. The youth pondered for a long moment, his hand upon the withered bone at his belt. A voice, seeming to come from the Well itself, echoed around him, "First, tell me this, mortal: I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?" At the edge of a desolate plateau, he found it: a dark, swirling pit in the ground from which faint murmurs arose, like a thousand hushed arguments. He picked up the bone and tucked it into his belt, feeling it was a sign, though whether for good or ill, he could not tell.
Chapter 6
As he climbed higher, the air grew thin and the silence was broken only by the caw of a three-eyed raven circling overhead, which dropped a single, withered bone at his feet. The youth thanked the goat for its varied assistance, and with a sigh, continued towards the Howling Peaks, now slightly hungrier and with a more ventilated cloak. "Furthermore," added the goat, chewing thoughtfully on the youth's thin cloak, "the Well only whispers on days when the wind blows from the direction of breakfast." "The Well you seek," the goat eventually admitted after the youth shared his stale bread, "is guarded by three riddles, and if you answer wrong, it giggles, and your ears fill with bees." The goat then insisted on leading him, taking him by way of a bog that smelled of old socks, a field of remarkably aggressive cabbages, and a stream that flowed uphill on Tuesdays. On the seventh day, he came upon a scrawny goat with a long beard, which bleated, "Hark, traveller, I know all paths, especially those best avoided, unless you have a particular fondness for thorn bushes that enjoy conversation!" He travelled for many days, over sharp, rocky paths, with bitter winds chilling him to the bone, towards the distant Howling Peaks. Many of the common folk, seeing his meager provisions, shook their heads, and some old women wept, while little children offered him smooth pebbles from the roadway. He was given a worn sword by the king's brother, a thin cloak, and a loaf of stale bread for his journey.
Chapter 7
The youth, though he knew the dark source of this command, bowed his head and said, "I will go, for my mother the queen, and for my father the king." The queen, full of fear, knew not where to turn, until the king's brother, with a show of deep concern, suggested that the strong and now capable youth, the king's own son, might be the only one to undertake such a perilous quest. One night, as a storm raged, the servant of The Devil appeared again before the queen and declared, "The time for the first task is nigh: your champion must journey to the Howling Peaks and silence the Well of Whispers that drives men to madness with truths they cannot bear." The king's brother, ever solicitous, now spent many hours with the king, speaking softly in his ear of matters of state, to which the king only nodded. So years passed; the youth grew from a lad into a strong young man, and the king's brother became the true power behind the throne, while the queen grew pale with waiting. The youth, therefore, knowing what he knew, set his mind to uncovering the secrets of the king's brother and finding a way to break the queen's terrible obligation before the three tasks were demanded. There was great rejoicing in the land when the king first opened his eyes, though none knew the true price of his awakening. Though the king walked and spoke, he was but a shadow of his former self, and took no joy in his queen, his son, or his kingdom. The queen, with a heavy heart and the black feather clutched in her hand, sought out the one she believed to be the king's most loyal counsellor. For this pale man was none other than the king's own younger brother, who had long coveted the throne and was secretly skilled in the dark arts that had first induced the king's unnatural slumber.
Chapter 8
The youth, who had been secretly watching these midnight dealings from a high tower window, felt a chill that had nothing to do with the night air. The pale man vanished as mysteriously as he had come, leaving behind only a faint scent of brimstone and a single black feather on the queen's windowsill. The queen, seeing no other hope, tearfully agreed, and the next morning the king awoke, seemingly hale but with a curious coldness in his eyes. He promised the king's recovery in exchange for the queen's agreement to three tasks, to be performed by a champion of her choosing when the time came. Out of the shadows stepped a figure cloaked in flame and shadow, with eyes like burning coals, who named himself as a servant of The Devil. Finally, the queen agreed, and the pale man led her at midnight to a crossroads in the deep woods, where he drew a circle with a bone and uttered words that made the very trees tremble. The queen, distraught, refused this counsel at first, but as days turned into weeks, and the king faded further, the pale man's words took root. Then a tall, pale man in dark robes, who had arrived unbidden at the castle gates, began to whisper in the queen's ear that only a pact with a certain powerful but unnamed master could save the king. Wise women and physicians were summoned from every corner of the land, but none could rouse him from his unnatural sleep.
Chapter 9
The youth, then but a lad, had seen all this, and wondered greatly at the fragility of kings and the boldness of mice. It was during one of these mouse-induced commotions that the first signs of the king's strange malady appeared, for he laughed so hard at the cook slipping on a rogue piece of cheese that he coughed for an hour and then fell into a deep slumber. The princess, who had a mischievous streak, had often left small trails of cheese leading to peculiar places for the mouse to discover. One day, this mouse outdid itself and balanced the crumb on the very tip of the sleeping king's nose, a feat witnessed only by the princess. This cook had a particular nemesis, a very bold and clever mouse that always left exactly one crumb on his perfectly swept floor each morning. The cook, a portly man with a surprisingly nimble way with a rolling pin, often chased mice with it rather than using traps. Before that, life in the castle had been merry, despite the royal cook's unfortunate habit of singing terribly off-key at every meal. This journey had begun after the strange malady had claimed his own father, the good king. He had sought this lonely figure for many weeks, for it was said the hermit alone knew how to combat the creeping despair.
Chapter 10
The youth knelt beside the dying hermit in the desolate moorland chapel. The hermit, before breathing his last, had whispered to him the secret path to the source of the kingdom's woe. After many trials, and guided by the last words of the hermit, the youth finally reached the blighted courtyard of the forgotten castle. For there, in the heart of the blighted courtyard, the princess was held captive by a monstrous, shadowy beast whose eyes burned with a cold, dead light. The youth, seeing the princess in the beast's thrall, wasted no time but drew his shining sword and leapt upon it, dodging its snapping claws and fangs. As the hero struck the final blow against the shadowy beast, a great light shone from its dissolving form, and the evil presence which it had harbored vanished like smoke. And all the people cheered, and the bells rang out from every tower, for the dark enchantment that had long blighted the land was broken at last. The king embraced him, and said, "Brave youth, you have saved us all; take my daughter for your bride, and my kingdom after me." Then was the wedding held with great rejoicing, and the feast lasted many days throughout the land. And so he took the princess for his wife, and they ruled the kingdom wisely and lived contentedly therein to a great age.
