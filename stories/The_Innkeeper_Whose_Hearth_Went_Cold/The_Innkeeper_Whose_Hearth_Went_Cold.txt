The Innkeeper Whose Hearth Went Cold
There stood an inn by the crossroads called The Weary Traveller, kept by a man named Silas. He brewed passable ale and offered clean beds, but his heart was pinched, and he measured generosity by the clink of coin. He smiled when purses were full, but his face grew stony if a traveller looked poor.
One biting winter evening, when snow lay thick upon the ground and the wind howled like a wolf, an old woman knocked weakly at the inn door. She was wrapped in thin, ragged shawls, and ice clung to her white hair. "Good innkeeper," she rasped, her voice thin as frost, "pray let me warm myself by your fire for but an hour. I have no coin, but I am frozen to the bone."
Silas peered out, saw her poverty, and scowled. "No coin, no comfort," he snapped. "My fire warms those who pay. Be off with you, beggar woman, before you bring your chill into my clean inn." And he slammed the heavy oak door shut, bolting it fast. He turned back to his roaring hearth, rubbing his hands together, congratulating himself on saving a log of wood.
He heard no more from the old woman. But a moment later, a strange coldness seeped into the room. The great fire in the hearth, which had blazed merrily, suddenly sank. The flames dwindled, turned blue, then vanished utterly, leaving only cold, grey ashes. A chill, far deeper than the winter wind outside, settled over the hearthstone.
Silas stared, bewildered. He threw on more dry logs, used the bellows till his arms ached, struck his flint and steel until sparks showered – but the hearth remained stone cold. No flame would catch. It was as if the very idea of fire had forgotten that spot.
Confused and angry, Silas went to light the smaller stove in the kitchen. It too remained cold. He tried to light a candle – the wick blackened but would not take flame. Panic began to rise in him. His paying guests upstairs started complaining about the freezing rooms.
From that night on, no fire could be kindled within The Weary Traveller. The hearth was cold, the stove unusable, candles would not light, lamps would not burn. Silas had to buy cooked food from the village, his ale grew cold and unpopular, and his guests shivered and soon departed for warmer lodgings. His inn, once bustling, became a cold, deserted shell.
Silas grew desperate. He bought expensive, blessed tinderboxes; he hired travelling wizards who muttered charms; he even rebuilt the great hearth with new stones. Nothing worked. Fire itself shunned his inn. His wealth dwindled, his hands grew chapped with cold, and he spent his nights huddled under blankets, shivering where his warm fire once roared.
One evening, exactly a year later, sitting alone in his freezing inn, he heard a faint tapping. Thinking it was the wind, he ignored it. But it came again, persistent. Grumbling, he unbolted the door.
There stood the same old woman, looking no different than the year before, despite the milder weather. She carried a single, unlit taper. She looked at Silas, huddled and shivering in his own inn, and her eyes held no anger, only a deep coldness.
"Good innkeeper," she said, her voice clear now, "do you have a light for my candle? I wish to find my way."
Silas looked at her, then at his useless flint and steel, his unlightable lamps. He thought of the warmth he had denied her, the warmth that had then fled his own life. Shame washed over him, colder than the chill in his bones.
"Alas, mother," he stammered, his teeth chattering, "I have no fire to give. No spark will live within these walls."
The old woman looked past him at the dead, grey hearth. "No warmth given, no warmth kept," she said softly. She held out her taper. "Perhaps a neighbour has fire?"
Silas hesitated. Then, ashamed and desperate, he nodded. He took the taper, wrapped his cloak tightly, and stepped out into the night, leaving his door unbolted. He went to the nearest cottage, where a baker lived, and knocked humbly. The baker, surprised to see the proud innkeeper looking so wretched, nonetheless shared a flame from his oven.
Silas carefully shielded the tiny flame and carried the lit taper back to his inn. The old woman was waiting patiently. He held out the flickering taper to her.
She took it, and her eyes met his. "Warmth shared is warmth earned," she said. She touched the flame of her taper to the cold ashes in Silas's hearth.
Instantly, a small, bright flame sprang up. It grew steadily, catching the old logs, rising into a cheerful, warm blaze. The icy chill in the room retreated. Silas gasped, feeling warmth on his face for the first time in a year.
He turned to thank the old woman, but she was gone. Only the lit taper remained, standing upright on the hearthstone, burning brightly.
Silas never returned to his miserly ways. He learned that a warm hearth depended not just on wood, but on a warm heart. He welcomed poor travellers, shared his fire freely, and though he never became rich again, his inn was known once more as a place of comfort, kept warm by the memory of the cold and the simple magic of shared kindness.
