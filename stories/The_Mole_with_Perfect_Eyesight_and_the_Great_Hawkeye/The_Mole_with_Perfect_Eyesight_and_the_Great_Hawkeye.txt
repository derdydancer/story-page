The Mole with Perfect Eyesight and the Great Hawkeye
There was once a little mole who, unlike all his brethren, had perfect eyesight. When he dug his tunnels, he saw every tiny pebble and root so clearly that he often bumped his head trying to avoid them all. The other moles said he was too fussy about his digging, and they did not like it when he warned them of dangers they could not see in their dimly lit world. So one day, the little mole decided to leave the dark burrows and explore the bright world above ground. The sunlight was very bright, and he saw every blade of grass, every tiny wing of a gnat, and every dewdrop on a spider's web that shone like giant jewels. Presently, he saw a fox with a lean look meticulously counting a small pile of withered berries into a hollow log. The mole, with his perfect eyesight, could see that many of the berries were shriveled and a few were even a little moldy. The fox looked up, glared suspiciously at the mole, and quickly swept the berries deeper into the log with his paw, saying, "What are you looking at?" "I was looking at your berries, and some of them seem a bit past their best," answered the mole. "Nonsense!" snapped the fox, puffing out his chest. "These are the finest berries in the entire field, gathered with great effort!"
"Well, if you say so," said the mole calmly, "but there is a patch of truly plump, juicy ones just over that rise, if you'd care to look." "Aha!" yelped the fox, his eyes narrowing. "A trick! You want to lure me away so you can steal my magnificent treasure!" "Steal them?" replied the mole. "But why would I want those?" The fox snorted, "Be off with you, sharp-eyed meddler!" and turned his back, fussing again with his withered berries. The mole shrugged his little shoulders and ambled on, his perfect eyesight soon noticing a tiny, almost invisible thread stretched taut between two blades of grass. He peered closely and saw it was part of a flimsy snare, not very well made, attached to a bent twig. With a twitch of his nose, he nudged the bent twig with his snout, and the thread fell slack. Further off, near a clump of thistles, a large badger with a stern face was surveying the ground where the snare had been. The badger frowned, his own sharp eyes spotting the disabled snare, and he ambled over to inspect it with clear displeasure. The little mole, however, was already trotting further into the field, quite unaware of the badger's stern gaze following him.
In a more open part of the field, the mole came upon a group of rabbits diligently arranging small, grey pebbles into perfectly straight lines. His perfect eyesight showed him that the wind kept disturbing the lines, and that many of  the pebbles were not truly identical in shade or shape. A larger rabbit, who seemed to be overseeing the work, twitched its nose anxiously and chided another, "Quickly, quickly! That one is crooked!" "Excuse me," said the mole, approaching them, "but why are you making these lines of pebbles?" All the rabbits jumped as if stung by a bee and stared at the mole with wide, frightened eyes; one of them hissed, "Hush! You mustn't ask!" The larger rabbit stammered, "It is for The Great Hawkeye! For The Order of Things! The lines must be straight!" "But the wind blows them crooked, and the pebbles themselves are wobbly," observed the mole, still trying to be helpful. The rabbits gasped in horror at this, dropped their pebbles, and scattered in all directions, leaving the mole alone in the field. The little mole scratched his head with a paw, wondering why making neat lines with stones was such a serious and frightening business. As he was pondering this, the large, stern-faced badger he had seen earlier ambled purposefully towards him from the thistles.
"And who might you be, little digger," rumbled the badger, his voice low and gravelly, "roaming these fields and upsetting the workers?" "I am a mole, and I am just looking about," replied the mole, noticing every stiff whisker on the badger's snout. "Looking about, are you?" the badger said, his gaze unwavering. "You have unusually sharp eyes for a mole, they say." "Yes, I see things very well," the mole agreed, pleased that someone had noticed. "Well enough to see a poorly set snare, perhaps, and to meddle with it?" the badger pressed, his voice growing harder. "Oh, that flimsy thing?" said the mole. "Yes, I nudged it. It wouldn't have caught anything larger than a beetle, and it was spoiling the look of the grass." "Spoiling the look!" the badger exclaimed, his whiskers bristling. "All snares in these fields are His Snares, by decree of The Great Hawkeye! To touch one is an offense!" The mole blinked. "An offense? But who is this Great Hawkeye, and why would he want such untidy snares?" The badger gasped as if the mole had uttered a terrible curse. "You dare ask! Enough! You will come with me at once!" But the little mole, seeing the badger's angry expression, did not wait; he gave a frightened squeak and in a flash, dug straight down into the soft earth and was gone.
The badger snorted in frustration and dug uselessly at the rapidly filling hole with his large claws for a moment, then gave up with a growl. The little mole dug and dug, his perfect eyesight of little use in the pitch-black earth, until he felt he was far away from the stern badger. When he finally poked his nose above ground again, he found himself in a dark, cramped space that smelled strongly of musty roots and, faintly, of withered berries. His perfect eyes adjusted quickly to the dim light filtering from a crack, and he saw he was in the fox's hidden storeroom, filled with not just berries, but also dried-up apples, a few dubious-looking mushrooms, and some oddly shaped pebbles. A shadow fell over the crack of light, and the miserly fox's snarling face appeared. "Thief! Varmint!" he shrieked. "Raiding my larder, are you?" "Goodness me, no," said the mole, surprised. "I was escaping the badger, and I seem to have tunneled into the wrong place entirely." "Escaping the badger, a likely story!" scoffed the fox. "You're after my precious, hard-won treasures, admit it!" The mole peered at a particularly sad-looking turnip. "Are these truly treasures? This one looks a bit soft." The fox howled with indignation. "Soft! It's perfectly preserved! I'll teach you to mock my wealth, you burrowing nuisance!" Being in no mood for a lecture on turnip preservation, the mole once more dug rapidly downwards, narrowly avoiding a swipe from the fox's paw and causing a pile of turnips to tumble.
He tunneled on for some time, now keeping a careful metaphorical ear out for both stern badgers and shrieking foxes. This time, he surfaced on a sunny riverbank, where the gentle lapping of water and the warm sun on his fur felt quite pleasant. His sharp eyes, however, immediately noticed, nestled amongst the smooth, round river stones, a single pebble that was perfectly square. Intrigued, the mole nudged the square pebble with his nose, wondering how it had come to be so. The instant he touched it, the square pebble emitted a loud CLICK-WHIRR sound, and the mole jumped back in surprise. Before he could blink, a fine net sprang up from the riverbank grasses, entangling him completely. He wiggled and squirmed, his perfect eyesight showing him every knot in the net, but it held him fast. Then, the stern-faced badger ambled out from behind a willow tree, a grimly satisfied look on his face. "Well, well. Curiosity caught more than a beetle this time, little mole." "What are you going to do with me?" asked the mole, trying to sound braver than he felt as he peered through the net. "You, little mole," the badger declared with great seriousness, "are going for Re-education. The Great Hawkeye has specific methods for those with overly inquisitive noses and far too-sharp eyes."
The badger, without further ado, picked up the netted mole and began carrying him towards a tall, gnarled oak tree that stood alone on a distant rise. As they travelled, the mole, peering through the net, saw squirrels meticulously sorting acorns by exact shade of brown, and field mice marching in single file along a perfectly straight crack in the dry earth. "Why are those squirrels doing that with the acorns?" the mole asked, his voice slightly muffled by the net. "Surely some are for eating and some for burying, regardless of shade?" "It is part of The Great Hawkeye's Plan for Ultimate Tidiness," the badger grunted. "You will learn not to question such things very soon." Soon they reached the gnarled oak, and the mole saw with a shiver that its bark was studded with many pairs of shiny, unblinking glass eyes of different sizes, all appearing to stare. The badger deposited the netted mole on the ground directly in front of a particularly large and luminous pair of these glass eyes and announced, "Subject 734, exhibiting excessive curiosity and unauthorized optical acuity. For your consideration and correction, Great Hawkeye." A flat, toneless voice, seeming to come from the very wood of the tree, echoed, "Clarity can be discomfort. True peace is found in the harmony of sameness. We shall offer the bliss of adjusted perspective." The mole, trembling in his net, stared hard at the large glass eyes, and his perfect vision detected a minuscule scratch near the pupil of the right one, and beside it, a faintly etched symbol he almost recognized. With a jolt, he remembered seeing that exact same tiny, etched symbol on a broken clockwork bird the miserly fox had discarded as 'useless glitter.' Before he could ponder this strange connection, a bright, disorienting light shone from the large glass eyes, and the mole felt a strange tingling sensation behind his own perfectly sharp ones.
The light forced the mole to witness a bewildering series of images: crooked lines appearing perfectly straight, shriveled berries gleaming like fresh fruit, and the stern badger's face morphing into a kindly smile. "Your sight is an illusion, little mole," the toneless voice intoned. "True Seeing is perceiving the Grand Design, the Flawless Order that The Great Hawkeye provides for all." But through the dazzling light and flickering pictures, the mole's perfect eyesight, though strained, still perceived the truth: the images were being projected onto the *back* of the large glass eyes, from a flickering light source deep within the hollow oak tree. And the tiny etched symbol he had seen on the glass eye, and on the fox's broken clockwork bird, was likely a craftsman's mark – the craftsman being, he suddenly suspected, the miserly fox himself. A surge of indignation, not fear, filled the little mole; this whole Great Hawkeye business was no great spirit, but a clever, rather poorly made contraption! He remembered the fox's boasts about his 'finest berries' that were clearly not, and his suspicious, hoarding nature; it all made a dreadful, fraudulent kind of sense. Just then, the bright light from the glass eyes sputtered and dimmed for a second, as if the mechanism behind it was faulty. In that instant of dimness, the mole, filled with a new resolve, tore at the fine net with his surprisingly strong claws and ripped a hole large enough to squeeze through. He did not run, but instead darted towards a small, loose piece of bark at the base of the oak tree, where he suspected the inner workings might be reached. The badger let out a startled roar of, "Stop, subversive vermin!" but the mole was too quick and small, already scrambling into a narrow opening.
Inside the hollow tree, it was indeed the miserly fox, panting as he furiously worked a set of bicycle-like pedals with his hind legs and changed painted glass slides with his paws in front of a smoky oil lamp. "So, you are The Great Hawkeye!" declared the mole, his voice now firm, as the startled fox tumbled off his contraption with a yelp of surprise and rage. "How dare you intrude upon the nerve center of Ultimate Tidiness!" the fox spluttered, scrambling to his feet. "I'll have you re-educated for a thousand years!" "Your projection slides are dusty, one of the glass eyes has a nasty crack, and those pedals squeak terribly," the mole observed, peering at the mechanism with his head tilted. Just then, the stern badger poked his head into the opening, took in the scene with the fox and the contraption, and his jaw slowly dropped in bewilderment. "Is this the Great Hawkeye whose Plan for Ultimate Tidiness you were telling me about?" asked the mole, turning his bright gaze upon the astonished badger. The fox, red-faced, fumbled with a lever on his machine, trying to restart the light, but only managed to make the pedals spin backwards with a loud clank. The stern badger stared from the frantic fox to the calm mole, and then he slowly shook his large head, a strange new expression dawning on his usually grim face. "Perhaps," suggested the mole gently, "the rabbits could stop arranging pebbles now, and you could take up all those untidy snares, and this Great Hawkeye could simply retire?" The miserly fox slumped onto his broken contraption and wailed, "But... but my Ultimate Tidiness! My Grand Design!"
The badger looked at the heap of dusty slides and broken levers. "Seems your Grand Design was mostly just a grand mess, fox," he rumbled, a hint of a chuckle in his voice. Then the little mole, his eyes sharp as ever, spotted something glinting underneath a pile of moldy straw in a dark corner of the hollow tree – a small, beautifully crafted silver whistle, overlooked by the fox. He reached in and pulled out the silver whistle; it felt cool and smooth in his paws. "Now that," said the badger, nodding at the whistle, "might actually be useful. Perhaps to signal the start of the annual berry-picking festival, properly, with no nonsense about Tidiness." The fox grumbled, "That whistle was part of my long-range untidiness detection system," but no one paid him any mind. Word spread quickly, and soon the rabbits stopped their obsessive pebble-arranging, and the squirrels began to chatter merrily, their acorn-sorting forgotten. The little mole, with his perfect eyesight, watched as the field slowly returned to its wonderfully messy, unsorted, and un-straight-lined self, and he thought it looked much better that way. The large badger, before ambling off to investigate a truly interesting beetle, gave the little mole a slow, deliberate wink of one sharp eye. The mole decided he rather liked the bright world above, now that it was not trying so hard to be unnaturally tidy, and his perfect eyesight could be quite useful for spotting actual dangers, and genuinely ripe berries. And so it was that the fields became a much more sensible and relaxed place to live, all thanks to a little mole with unusually perfect eyesight, while the fox was often heard muttering in his hollow log about the good old days of Ultimate Tidiness.
