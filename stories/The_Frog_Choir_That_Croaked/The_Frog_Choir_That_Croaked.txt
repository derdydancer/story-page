The Frog Choir That Croaked
By the side of a marshy pond, there lived a great company of frogs.
They spent their days catching flies, swimming about, and croaking to each other in their froggy way.
One day, a fat old bullfrog named Bullywort, who fancied himself very important, had an idea.
He had heard the humans in the nearby village singing in their church.
It sounded grand and loud.
"My brothers!" croaked Bullywort, puffing out his green throat.
"We frogs have fine voices! Why should we not make a Grand Choir, like the humans? We shall practice and make music that will echo through the marsh!"
The other frogs thought this sounded very fine indeed.
They gathered around eagerly.
"Now," commanded Bullywort, "we must have order! We need high voices and low voices. All you little green frogs, you shall be the High Croaks. You bigger brown frogs, you are the Middle Croaks. And we largest bullfrogs, naturally, are the Deep Croaks!"
This seemed sensible enough.
They arranged themselves on the muddy bank: little frogs in front, brown frogs behind them, and the big bullfrogs at the back.
"First," said Bullywort, "we shall practice scales! High Croaks, sing 'Reep!'"
A chorus of tiny, high-pitched "Reep! Reep! Reep!" went up.
"Good! Middle Croaks, sing 'Cro-oak!'"
A wave of medium "Cro-oak! Cro-oak!" followed.
"Excellent! Deep Croaks, sing 'Bur-rum!'"
A deep, resonant "Bur-rum! Bur-rum!" shook the reeds.
"Splendid!" puffed Bullywort.
"Now, all together! We shall sing a Song of the Pond!"
He raised his webbed foot like a conductor.
"Ready? Sing!"
He expected a mighty chorus.
Instead, what came out was chaos.
The High Croaks went "Reep-reep-reep!" very fast.
The Middle Croaks began "Cro-oak!" but got distracted by a dragonfly and trailed off.
The Deep Croaks let out a slow, booming "BUR-RUM!" that completely drowned out the others.
Then one frog saw a tasty midge and leaped for it with a loud *plop*.
Another tripped over a root and fell squawking into the water.
Soon, all the frogs were croaking different things at different times, or chasing insects, or bumping into each other.
It was not a choir; it was a cacophony.
Bullywort hopped up and down, croaking furiously.
"Silence! Order! Follow my lead!"
He tried again.
"A simple tune! 'The Sun is Warm'! High Croaks: Reep-reep warm! Middle Croaks: Cro-oak sun! Deep Croaks: Bur-rum is warm!"
He waved his foot.
"Reep-reep warm! Cro-oak sun! Bur-rum is warm!" came the ragged attempt.
It sounded less like music and more like someone dropping logs into mud.
Just then, a Heron, long-legged and sharp-beaked, landed silently at the edge of the pond, attracted by the noise.
Its eyes fixed on the disorganized frogs.
One little High Croak spotted the danger.
"Reep! (Heron!)" it shrieked, and dove for the water.
Instantly, the Grand Choir dissolved.
"Cro-oak! (Danger!)" went the Middle Croaks, scattering.
"Bur-rum! (Flee!)" boomed the Deep Croaks, leaping into the deepest part of the pond with mighty splashes.
Bullywort was the last to react, still trying to conduct.
The Heron's beak darted down, but Bullywort, with a terrified "BUR-RUMPH!", jumped just in time, landing deep in the mud.
When the danger had passed, the frogs slowly poked their heads above the water.
They looked at each other.
They looked at Bullywort, covered in mud.
No one spoke of the Grand Choir again.
They went back to catching flies, swimming about, and croaking to each other in their own froggy way, which, after all, seemed to suit them much better.
