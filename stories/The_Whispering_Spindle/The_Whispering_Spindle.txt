The Whispering Spindle
There lived a poor widow in a small cottage hard by a dark wood, and she had but one daughter, whose name was Elara.Day in and day out, they earned their bread by spinning flax into fine thread, using an old spindle passed down from the grandmother.But now their small store of flax was almost gone, and hunger knocked at their door.The widow wept bitterly and said, "Child, you must take the last of our thread to the market town and sell it for what little you can."So Elara obeyed, and wrapped the small bundle of grey thread in a cloth.She set out at dawn, walking the lonely path that led through the dark wood towards the market town.Now it happened that as she walked beneath the oldest oaks, the old spindle tucked in her apron pocket began to hum strangely.A tiny voice seemed to whisper from it, saying, "Leave the path, Elara, turn aside where the ferns grow thickest, for something waits for you there."Elara was afraid, remembering her mother's need and the path she ought to follow.But the spindle hummed louder still, and she felt a pull she could not resist, so she stepped off the path into the deep green ferns.
The tall ferns closed behind her like a green gate, the sounds of the path vanished, and the air grew strangely still and warm.The spindle in her apron tugged gently forwards, leading her deeper and deeper where no sunlight seemed to fall.At last she came to a small clearing, and in its center stood an ancient moss-covered stone shaped like a stool.Sitting on the stone was a tiny old woman, no bigger than a child, humming as she deftly mended a pair of worn leather shoes.The old woman looked up, her eyes bright as beads, and said, "So you have come at last; the spindle called loudly for one with nimble fingers and an honest heart.""Good mother," said Elara, bowing low, "I am Elara, and my mother is poor; I was sent to market with our last thread, but the spindle led me here.""Market thread is naught," chuckled the old woman, "Forget the market; I have worthier work for you here, if you dare.""If you will spin for me one day, using this stone as your seat and your own spindle, then when the moon rises, the spindle will grant you one wish for your mother."Elara agreed readily, for she thought only of her mother and the help a wish might bring.The old woman smiled, placed a bundle of shimmering white flax beside the stone, and then vanished like mist among the ferns.
So Elara sat upon the mossy stone, took up her old spindle, and began to spin the shimmering flax.The spindle turned almost by itself in her hands, and the white flax flowed like water, becoming thread finer and brighter than any she had ever seen, like strands of moonlight.But as she spun, the spindle whispered again, "Spin well, Elara, but take care; do not prick your finger upon my sharp point, or all the bright thread will turn black as coal."Elara heard the warning and was careful, holding the spindle lightly and drawing the wondrous flax with gentle hands.She spun all day while the light faded in the clearing, and soon the bundle of flax was almost gone, and the spindle was full of shining thread.Just then, she heard a faint sound nearby, like a small child weeping softly in the ferns.Her kind heart was touched by the sound, and for a moment she forgot the spindle and its warning.Her hand slipped on the smooth wood, and the spindle's sharp point pricked her thumb.Instantly, all the fine, shining thread on the spindle turned black as a crow's wing.Elara cried out in dismay, seeing her day's work ruined and the wish for her mother now surely lost.
As her cry faded, the tiny old woman stood before her once more, her bright eyes seeming to pierce the gloom."Ah, child," she said, her voice sharp now, "You have been careless and spoiled the moonlight thread with a thoughtless touch.""Forgive me, good mother," wept Elara, "I heard a child weeping nearby, and my heart drew my thoughts away.""Weeping is naught to this work," the old woman snapped. "The spindle demands a hand that guides and a mind that watches only the thread.""The wish is lost to you now, and you cannot stay here in my quiet clearing.""But your heart is not black, only forgetful, so I give you this;" she said, holding out the spindle now heavy with the dark thread."This black thread holds sorrow, yet it may serve you still; unwind it where true grief lies hidden, and perhaps healing may follow.""Go now towards the Silent Mountain that stands beyond the Whispering Falls; your path lies that way."Elara took the spindle heavy with the dark thread, her heart full of both fear and a strange resolve.Then the old woman turned and was gone in the blink of an eye, leaving only the mossy stone and the deep silence of the woods.
Elara left the clearing, clutching the spindle with its black thread, and walked towards the unseen Silent Mountain.She soon found herself on a pathless way, pushing through tangled thorns and stumbling over loose stones.After a time, she heard a great rushing sound ahead, and knew it must be the Whispering Falls the old woman had named.She came to a deep chasm where water fell like white smoke into shadows below, and the air was full of hushed whispers that seemed to have no source.There was no bridge across the chasm, nor any path around it, and the Silent Mountain rose vast and grey on the other side.Elara sat upon the damp rocks, her hope failing, until she remembered the old woman's words and the spindle heavy with black thread.She listened again to the hushed whispers rising from the mist, and now they sounded only like endless, lonely sorrow. "Perhaps this is the hidden grief," she thought.Taking courage, she took the spindle, found the end of the black thread, and held it out towards the chasm filled with mist and whispers.The black thread flew from the spindle, swift as a dark bird, across the chasm, and made itself fast to a black rock on the far side, making a single, thin bridge.Though it looked thin as shadow and swayed in the damp air, Elara put her foot upon the thread bridge, walked carefully, and reached the other side safely.
The land on this side was grey rock and dust; no trees grew here, no birds sang, and a great silence lay upon everything.Elara walked onward across the grey land, and the Silent Mountain loomed ever larger before her, its peak hidden in cloud.When she came to the very foot of the mountain, she found the only path upwards was blocked by a great hound, black as night, lying across it with eyes like burning embers.The hound did not move, but spoke in a deep rumble like shifting stones, "None may pass onto the Silent Mountain unless they pay the price of silence.""The price of silence?" asked Elara, puzzled. "Good hound, I have nothing left; I am only a poor girl with this spindle of black thread.""That black thread holds sorrow," rumbled the hound, its ember eyes fixed on the spindle. "Give its silence of grief to the mountain's silence; that is the price."Elara understood then; she must give up the thread that might have brought healing, offering its sorrow instead as passage.With trembling hands, she took the spindle, unwound the long black thread, and laid it carefully upon the grey stone path before the hound.The black thread seemed to sink into the stone and vanished like smoke, and the great hound nodded its head slowly and stepped aside from the path.Elara walked past the now-sleeping hound and began to climb the steep, silent path up the mountainside.
The climb was long and steep, with only the grey rock beneath her feet and the cold wind whistling silently around her.At last, she reached the summit, a flat, windswept place encircled by a ring of tall, weathered standing stones.And in the very center of the ring lay her own spindle, no longer black, but shining brightly and wound full with thread white as fallen snow.Elara gasped with wonder and joy, ran forward, and took up the spindle that felt warm in her hands.The spindle hummed warmly and whispered, "The thread is white again, Elara, for the mountain's silence paid the price of sorrow; the wish is yours to make."Elara remembered her poor mother waiting alone, and holding the spindle close, she whispered, "I wish only that my mother may have a warm cottage, food enough, and flax to spin always."The spindle glowed brightly for a moment, and Elara felt a warmth spread through her, and somehow she knew her wish was granted far away.Then before her, where no path had been, a path of smooth white stones appeared, leading gently downwards from the summit.Elara stepped onto the white path, and it led her swiftly down the mountain, through the misty chasm which now held no whispers, and back into the familiar woods.Soon she came once more to the edge of the dark wood near her cottage, and the setting sun shone warmly through the trees.
But the cottage before her was no longer small and poor; it stood sturdy and trim, with smoke rising cheerfully from the chimney and a neat garden beside it.Her mother, no longer thin and pale but with rosy cheeks, stood smiling in the doorway, shading her eyes to watch the path.When she saw Elara, she cried out with great joy and ran to meet her, hugging her tightly."Oh, my child," she said, "While you were gone, some magic happened! Our cottage grew strong, food appeared on the table, and a cart delivered more fine flax than we could spin in a year!"Elara smiled and held her mother close, saying only, "Perhaps the wood holds more kindness than we knew, Mother."And so they lived in comfort in their sturdy cottage, and spun the fine flax together, and wanted for nothing.The spindle now seemed only an ordinary tool of wood, yet it spun the best thread in the village and sometimes, Elara thought, it hummed softly to itself.Elara never forgot the tiny old woman, the journey through the ferns, the black thread, or the Silent Mountain.And though she spoke little of where she had been that day, those who looked closely saw a quiet wisdom and a deep understanding in her eyes.And they say she and her mother lived happily in their warm cottage beside the wood for all the rest of their days.
