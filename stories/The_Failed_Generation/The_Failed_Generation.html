var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "Establishes the protagonist's initial, humble, and unfortunate circumstances as an orphan working in a stable. This sets his starting point in life.", "Grimm Style": "Follows the 'There was once...' formula for introducing a character and their situation. Uses simple, direct language and an archetypal low-status character (orphan, stable boy).", "Moral Implication": "Highlights themes of poverty, hardship, and the vulnerability of orphans from the outset. Suggests a life of toil and lack of status.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The orphan stable boy represents the undeveloped Ego in a state of deprivation, lacking parental figures (internal guiding principles) and forced into menial labor (engaging with basic, perhaps instinctual aspects of life \ufffd stables, animals). His orphan status implies a disconnect from heritage or established psychic structures.", "Sentence": "There was once an orphan boy who toiled as a stable hand, knowing no mother or father.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces a key companion and comedic element: the Blind Rooster. Establishes its unique characteristic (blindness) and its constant presence with the boy.", "Grimm Style": "Introduces an animal character with a distinctive, slightly absurd trait (blindness for a rooster). Simple description of their relationship. Animals often play significant roles in Grimm tales.", "Moral Implication": "Suggests companionship can be found even in hardship. The rooster's blindness might imply a different way of perceiving the world, or simply a shared vulnerability.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Blind Rooster could symbolize flawed instinct, unconsciousness leading the way erratically, or a comically impaired guiding principle (a 'blind guide'). Its attachment to the boy suggests a bond between the Ego and this peculiar, perhaps unreliable, aspect of his psyche or fate.", "Sentence": "His only true companion was a rooster, blind in both its eyes, which followed him everywhere.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the rooster's disruptive but ultimately harmless nature, setting up its role as a source of minor chaos and comedy. Foreshadows its potential to drive plot through accidents.", "Grimm Style": "Uses simple, concrete actions ('pecked at air,' 'tripped over buckets,' 'caused much bother'). The tone is matter-of-fact about the disruption. 'Never truly meaning harm' fits the characterization of a simple creature.", "Moral Implication": "Even disruptive elements can be harmless at heart. Tolerance for imperfection. Hints that accidents can happen without malicious intent (a heavy subject touched lightly).", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The rooster's actions (pecking air, tripping) represent the chaotic, unpredictable nature of unconscious impulses or flawed intuition. It causes 'bother' (disruption to the Ego's ordered efforts) but without malice, suggesting these forces are not inherently evil, just uncoordinated or misdirected.", "Sentence": "The rooster often pecked at empty air, or tripped over buckets, and caused much bother, though it never truly meant harm.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "Establishes the master of the stables as a harsh figure, providing a source of conflict and contributing to the boy's hardship. This introduces a minor antagonist.", "Grimm Style": "Introduces an archetypal 'Master' figure (Part 6 of guide) who is cruel ('harsh man,' 'quick with his switch'). Simple description of his behavior. Direct cause and effect (rooster's mishap leads to master's anger).", "Moral Implication": "Shows the injustice and cruelty faced by the vulnerable. Introduces the theme of undeserved punishment, a heavy subject.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The harsh stable master could represent a critical, punishing Superego figure, or an oppressive external authority that makes the Ego's life difficult. His anger at the rooster's mishaps shows intolerance for unconscious errors or imperfections.", "Sentence": "The stable master was a harsh man, quick with his switch, and often grew wroth at the rooster's blunders.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 4}, {"Plot Function": "Illustrates an instance of the rooster's blunder leading to punishment for the boy, emphasizing his shared fate with the animal and the injustice he endures.", "Grimm Style": "Specific example of cause and effect. Simple actions ('rooster upset a pail,' 'boy received the beating'). The language is direct and reports the unfortunate event without emotional coloring.", "Moral Implication": "Highlights the theme of scapegoating or suffering for another's mistakes. The bond between boy and rooster leads to shared suffering. Unfairness of life for the powerless.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (boy) suffers due to the actions of his flawed instinct/unconscious aspect (rooster). This represents how unconscious blunders can bring down the wrath of the Superego or external authority upon the conscious self. The Ego takes the punishment for what it cannot fully control within itself.", "Sentence": "One morning, the blind rooster upset a pail of fresh milk, and it was the boy who received the beating for it.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "Shows the boy's compassion and loyalty towards the rooster despite the trouble it causes. This establishes a key trait of the protagonist: kindness even amidst suffering.", "Grimm Style": "Simple action demonstrating character ('shared his meager crust'). Direct statement of care ('never blamed the creature'). This aligns with the 'Kind/Pious Figure' subtle archetype (Part 9).", "Moral Implication": "Kindness and compassion in the face of adversity. Loyalty to a flawed companion. Highlights a virtuous character trait in the protagonist.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego, despite suffering due to the flawed unconscious aspect (rooster), maintains a compassionate connection to it, sharing its scant resources (meager crust = limited psychic energy). This suggests an acceptance and integration of even the disruptive or 'blind' parts of the self, which is a sign of developing maturity.", "Sentence": "Still, the boy always shared his meager crust of bread with the blind rooster and never blamed the creature.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 6}, {"Plot Function": "Depicts the daily grind and unchanging hardship of the boy's life. Emphasizes the bleakness and lack of prospect in his current situation.", "Grimm Style": "Uses general terms to describe the passage of time and routine ('So the days passed'). Simple description of unchanging toil ('filled with mucking out stalls and little food'). Reinforces the initial setting of hardship.", "Moral Implication": "Presents the monotony of poverty and hard labor as a heavy subject. Lack of hope or change.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego's existence is one of repetitive, unfulfilling tasks ('mucking out stalls' \ufffd dealing with psychic waste or the mundane) and insufficient nourishment ('little food' \ufffd lack of psychic sustenance or growth). This portrays a stagnant phase of early Ego development.", "Sentence": "So the days passed, each one much like the last, filled with mucking out stalls and little food.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 7}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces the King and his castle as distant, aspirational figures/places, contrasting sharply with the boy's lowly existence. This hints at a larger world beyond the stables.", "Grimm Style": "Introduces archetypal royalty and setting ('King,' 'castle on a high hill'). Uses simple description to create contrast ('shone like a star,' 'far from the grime'). Sets up a potential goal or different sphere of life.", "Moral Implication": "Shows the vast social divide. The high and mighty exist far from the struggles of the poor. Aspiration towards something better, even if seemingly unattainable.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The King and Castle represent a higher state of consciousness, order, or the integrated Self, perceived by the lowly Ego (stable boy) as distant and almost mythical ('shone like a star'). It's a symbol of potential development or a goal for the individuation journey, currently 'far from the grime' of the Ego's current psychic state.", "Sentence": "Sometimes, the boy would see the King's castle on a high hill, and it shone like a star, far from the grime of the stables.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 8}, {"Plot Function": "The boy has no dreams or ambitions beyond his current life, highlighting his resignation or lack of awareness of other possibilities due to his upbringing.", "Grimm Style": "Directly states the character's lack of aspiration ('never dreamed he might one day see its gates'). Simple and poignant, emphasizing his limited horizons.", "Moral Implication": "The crushing effect of poverty and circumstance on aspiration. A heavy subject of how one's environment shapes belief about what's possible.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego, mired in its current state of deprivation, cannot even conceive of reaching the higher state of consciousness or integration (castle gates). This shows a limited self-concept and lack of hope or vision for change, common in early stages of development or when oppressed by negative complexes.", "Sentence": "He never dreamed he might one day see its gates, for such was not the lot of a stable boy.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 9}, {"Plot Function": "The rooster, in its blindness, continues its usual behavior, acting as a constant, unchanging element in the boy's harsh life.", "Grimm Style": "Simple, recurring action of the animal companion ('pecked faithfully at his heels'). Reinforces the rooster's character and its bond with the boy, ending the chapter by returning to this pair.", "Moral Implication": "Loyalty and companionship, even in flawed forms, provide a constant. Life continues with its small, familiar patterns despite the larger hardships.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The flawed instinctual aspect (blind rooster) remains a constant companion to the Ego, its actions unchanging. This emphasizes the persistence of certain unconscious patterns or dynamics in the Ego's life, for better or worse, as the first stage of the narrative is established.", "Sentence": "And the blind rooster pecked faithfully at his heels, clucking softly.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 10}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces a significant event: the King's declaration of a great task, which will disrupt the boy's monotonous life and offer a potential (though unlikely) path to change.", "Grimm Style": "Classic fairy tale trope: a royal proclamation setting up a challenge or quest. 'It came to pass' is a typical transitional phrase. The vagueness of 'a great task' builds anticipation.", "Moral Implication": "Opportunity can arise unexpectedly, even for the lowly. The powerful dictate events that affect everyone. This hints at the theme of fate or destiny intervening.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "A call to action or a significant challenge ('great task') is issued by the ruling principle of consciousness (King). This represents an impetus from the Self or a major life event that demands a response from the Ego and has the potential to alter its current trajectory.", "Sentence": "It came to pass that the King of that land declared a great task to be done, and a reward for any who could achieve it.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 11}, {"Plot Function": "Specifies the nature of the task: retrieving a lost artifact, the 'Sunstone,' from a dangerous location. This defines the quest objective.", "Grimm Style": "Names a specific (though generically grand) magical-sounding item ('Sunstone'). Mentions an archetypal dangerous place ('Dragon's Crag'). Provides clear details for the quest.", "Moral Implication": "Great rewards are tied to great risks. The task involves facing a formidable danger to recover something precious that has been lost.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The task involves retrieving a 'Sunstone' (symbol of light, consciousness, value, perhaps a lost aspect of the Self) from a 'Dragon's Crag' (the lair of a powerful, destructive unconscious force or complex \ufffd the Dragon archetype, a Threshold Guardian). This is a classic hero's quest: to reclaim lost psychic treasure from the dangerous depths of the unconscious.", "Sentence": "A precious Sunstone, a jewel of great power, had been lost on the Dragon's Crag, and he who returned it would be greatly honored.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 12}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the reaction of the populace: many brave and noble men are eager to attempt the task, highlighting the desirability of the reward and the competitive nature of the quest.", "Grimm Style": "Shows the widespread response to the proclamation. 'Knights and heroes' are archetypal figures of courage. Simple description of their motivation ('eager for glory and gold').", "Moral Implication": "Many are drawn by the promise of reward and honor.

The third task is complete.", "Sentence": "With a howl of fury and shame that shook the dead trees, the Devil vanished in a clap of sulfurous thunder, leaving the boy alone with the cursed coin, which now lay strangely peaceful in his palm, its weeping ceased.", "Chapter Number": 17, "Sentence Number": 170}, {"Plot Function": "The boy returns to the King, carrying the now-peaceful coin and the memory of the Devil's tear. He is changed by this encounter, older and warier.", "Grimm Style": "Hero returns after the final, most perilous task. 'His face was pale, and his eyes held a new gravity' shows the impact of the ordeal without internal monologue. The 'peaceful coin' is the evidence.", "Moral Implication": "Confronting great evil, even successfully, leaves a mark on the soul. The acquisition of grim wisdom. The journey from innocence to experience.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego returns from the confrontation with the ultimate Shadow, profoundly changed ('pale,' 'new gravity'). It has witnessed and evoked remorse from the heart of darkness. Carrying the 'peaceful coin' symbolizes that a measure of healing or resolution has been achieved regarding that specific psychic wound. The Ego has matured significantly.", "Sentence": "The boy made his way back to the castle as dawn was breaking; his face was pale, and his eyes held a new gravity, but in his hand, the once-cursed coin felt light and clean.", "Chapter Number": 18, "Sentence Number": 171}, {"Plot Function": "He presents the transformed coin to the King and recounts what happened, perhaps with a reluctance to speak too much of the Devil.", "Grimm Style": "Hero reports his success.

His account is brief ('spoke only of the tear he had witnessed').", "Moral Implication": "The evidence of the deed speaks for itself. Some experiences are too profound or terrible to be easily recounted. The power of redemption or cleansing, even for a cursed object.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego presents the 'transformed coin' to the central ruling principle (King). Its new light ('forgiving light') signifies that the psychic wound it represented has been cleansed or redeemed through the encounter with the Devil's remorse. The Ego's reluctance to detail the encounter shows the ineffable nature of such deep psychic experiences.", "Sentence": "He stood before the King, who looked older himself, and laid the coin upon the arm of the throne; it no longer wept, but gleamed with a soft, forgiving light.", "Chapter Number": 18, "Sentence Number": 172}, {"Plot Function": "The King is deeply awed by this final achievement, recognizing the immense spiritual courage and power involved. He acknowledges all tasks are complete.", "Grimm Style": "King's profound reaction to the final success.

Declares the trials complete.", "Moral Implication": "The highest respect is due for spiritual victory over evil. True worth is recognized, transcending all social barriers. The hero has proven himself beyond all doubt.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The central ruling principle (King) shows profound respect ('bowed his head') for the Ego's achievement in evoking remorse from the ultimate Shadow and thereby healing the 'cursed coin.'
