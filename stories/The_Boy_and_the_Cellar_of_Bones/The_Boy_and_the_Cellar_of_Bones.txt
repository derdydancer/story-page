The Boy and the Cellar of Bones
There was once a boy whose father had vanished when he was but a babe in arms. His mother, a poor woman, spoke naught of him, and no one in the village knew whither he had gone. The boy and his mother dwelt in a small, crooked house with a damp earth floor, pressed hard against the side of a low hill. Beneath the house was a dank, dark cellar, and his mother had told him many a time never to go down into it. One day, their only fat pig knocked over a basket, and the greatest turnip they had saved for winter rolled right across the floor and into the cellar hole. His mother wept bitterly and said, "Alas, boy, you must go down and fetch it, for we have naught else so fine to eat!" So the boy took a flickering candle, lifted the heavy trapdoor, and crept down the steep, rotten steps. The air was thick with the smell of old earth and something else, like spoiled meat, and water dripped slowly in a dark corner. He found the turnip quickly, for it had rolled near a pile of strange tools, not for farming: heavy hammers, sharp chisels, and a long, thin saw with cruel teeth. He picked up the turnip, but then reached out and touched the cold handle of the saw; at once, there was a grinding sound, and a great flat stone in the far wall shifted inwards.
Behind the stone was a dark, narrow passage, leading further down into the hill. The boy forgot the turnip and his mother's call; he held his candle high and stepped into the passage. The passage twisted, and the walls were damp rock, but the smell was different here: a sickly sweet smell, like old honey and dust. Soon he came to a small, round chamber, carved from the earth. In the centre of the chamber sat a great wooden chest, bound with iron. The boy pushed at the lid with all his might, but it was locked fast and did not move. He looked all around the chest for a keyhole or a latch, but there was none to be seen. Then he remembered the strange tools in the outer cellar, and thought the long, thin saw might serve to cut the iron bands. He hurried back through the passage, his candle making shadows dance on the damp walls. When he reached the outer cellar where the tools lay, he heard his mother’s voice calling from above, thin and anxious, "Boy, where is the turnip?"
The boy stood still by the pile of tools, the turnip forgotten at his feet. "Boy!" cried his mother again from the trapdoor. "Have you fallen, or are you lost with my fine turnip?" He grabbed the long saw and called back cheerily, "I am coming now, Mother, with the grandest turnip of all!" Then, clutching the saw, he hurried back down the dark passage to the round chamber. He set to work on the first iron band, and the saw rasped loudly against the metal in the quiet earth. After much toil, the first band snapped with a crack, but the saw skittered and sliced his hand, so red blood welled forth. He tore a strip from his thin shirt and bound the wound tightly. The second band was easier, and soon it too fell away; the heavy lid creaked open, revealing not gold, nor jewels, but bones, white and jumbled. Among them, a small, tarnished silver locket lay half-hidden beneath a rib bone. The boy picked up the locket with his uninjured hand and stared at it in the candlelight.
He pressed the tiny clasp of the locket with his thumb, but it was stiff and would not yield. He took one of the sharpest chisels he had seen earlier and carefully wedged its point into the seam of the locket, then twisted. The locket sprang open with a click, and inside was not a painted face of a lady, as he had half-expected, but a tiny folded piece of parchment, yellowed with age. His fingers trembled slightly as he unfolded the brittle parchment. Upon it was a list of names, strange to him, and beside each name, a date, written in a hand he knew: his father’s. The last name on the list, with the most recent date, was that of a travelling merchant from the next valley, who had vanished without trace two summers past. The boy understood then that the bones in the chest were those his father had put there, and that his father had been a killer of men. At that very moment, a loud thump came from the trapdoor above, followed by his mother's heavy tread. "Boy!" she called, her voice sharp now. "What devilry are you about down there? I heard noises like a great beast gnawing! I shall fetch the village watchman!" The boy thrust the parchment and locket inside his shirt, his heart like a trapped bird against his ribs.
He scrambled back into the outer cellar and pushed the great flat stone back into place with a grunt. He grabbed a hammer and a chisel from the pile, then wiped sweat from his brow, readying a tale of trying to fix a loose stone that had made him drop the turnip. Just then, his mother’s face appeared at the trapdoor, and beside her, the stout village watchman, a man with a large nose and a self-important air, peered down with a stern face. "Hark ye, lad!" boomed the watchman. "Your good mother tells me of strange clangings and groanings! What manner of infernal racket and subterranean manufactory of mischief have you been conducting down here?" The boy held up the hammer and chisel, and the long-forgotten turnip from his pocket, saying, "Good sirs, it was only that clumsy pig again, it knocked loose a stone in the wall when it sent the turnip down here, and I was but trying to set it right!" "Hmmph. A likely tale of porcine interference," grumbled the watchman, stroking his nose, "but this cellar has an ill air about it, boy, an ill air indeed, not fit for honest Christian folk." "Enough!" said his mother. "No more talk of pigs or stones. You are to come out of that vile place this instant, boy, and it shall be barred henceforth and forevermore!" The boy climbed out of the cellar, the tarnished silver locket pressed cold against his skin beneath his shirt. The watchman nodded sagely, adding, "Aye, best to keep such an ill-omened pit well-sealed!" and together he and the mother dragged a great wooden beam across the trapdoor. And so the boy lived on in the crooked house, with the terrible secret of his father and the bones shut fast beneath the earth, though the locket he kept hidden, always.
