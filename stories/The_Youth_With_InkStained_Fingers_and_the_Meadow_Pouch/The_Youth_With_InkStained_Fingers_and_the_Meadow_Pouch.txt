The Youth With Ink-Stained Fingers and the Meadow Pouch
In a certain grand city, far off, lived a youth with ink-stained fingers, who had tried and failed mightily at being an artist. He possessed naught but the rags he wore and a poor hut on the edge of the city. Only, he did possess a small leather pouch, tied with a string, which his grandmother had given him before she passed. This pouch was strange, for when he reached inside, his hand found not coins or trinkets, but a patch of soft grass, hinting at a full meadow within. He often drew forth great handfuls of sweet-smelling grass from the pouch, tossing them to the lean donkey of his stingy landlord, who wondered where such fodder came from. One day, a stout man with ink-stained fingers of his own, a paint-seller, came to his hut, demanding payment for paint and brushes long used up. "Three days you have, you penniless dauber!" cried the stout man, "Else I take your hut and everything in it!" The youth with ink-stained fingers realized he had naught that could be sold for such a sum, and despair filled his heart. So, before the three days were up, he tied the pouch to his belt and went forth from the city gate, though he knew not whither. He walked for many hours, until the city was but a smudge upon the horizon, and he found himself on a barren plain bordering a twisted, dark wood.
Presently, he saw a figure sitting on a rock, dressed in clothes far too fine for such a place, a man with a smile like a polished boot, the sharp-dressed tempter himself. "Ah, young Josef!" called the sharp-dressed tempter, his voice like oil on water, "Fleeing your little troubles?" "I know of your debt," the sharp-dressed tempter continued, standing, "and I can make it vanish, for but a small trifle pulled from that curious pouch of yours." The youth with ink-stained fingers stared, for he had never shown the pouch to anyone, saying, "How do you know of my pouch?" "My boy," smiled the sharp-dressed tempter, adjusting a cufflink that gleamed like ice, "I know many things that are hidden." "Very well," said the youth with ink-stained fingers, clutching the pouch tighter, "anything would be better than facing that paint-seller." "Excellent," the sharp-dressed tempter's smile widened, showing sharp, white teeth, "For your debt to vanish, you must bring me what I ask from the pouch, for three nights, one thing each night." "On the first night, as the moon is highest," said the sharp-dressed tempter, leaning closer, "you shall reach in and bring me a single blade of dew-kissed grass." The youth with ink-stained fingers, seeing no harm in such a simple request, agreed. "Excellent," the sharp-dressed tempter chuckled, and then, with a scent of sulfur and violets, he vanished as if he had never been there.
The youth with ink-stained fingers, marveling, returned to the city and found his debt to the stout paint-seller magically paid in full. As night fell, the youth with ink-stained fingers remembered his promise to the sharp-dressed tempter and clutched the pouch, feeling the soft grass within. He reached his hand deep inside, feeling the coolness and the strange, vast space beyond his elbow. He pulled forth a single blade of grass, glistening with dew, exactly as the sharp-dressed tempter had asked. The sharp-dressed tempter appeared from the shadows, his smile visible even in the low light. "Ah yes, the freshness," the sharp-dressed tempter murmured, turning the blade in his hand, "So little here, so much there." "Tomorrow night," the sharp-dressed tempter commanded, "you shall bring me a flower from the meadow, but only one that holds the scent of first bloom." "The scent?" asked the youth with ink-stained fingers, frowning. "Just bring it," the sharp-dressed tempter snapped, and vanished again. The youth with ink-stained fingers pondered the strange request for the scent of first bloom all the next day.
As the second night came, the youth with ink-stained fingers, clutching the pouch, searched his mind for what the scent of first bloom might mean. Again, he reached his hand deep inside, feeling the grass and the air shift as if a gate had opened. Within the meadow in the pouch, under the moon's strange light that filtered in, he sought a flower with the scent of first bloom. He found a tiny blue bloom near a hidden brooklet, which smelled of rain and promise, and he carefully pulled it from the soil. The sharp-dressed tempter stood before him, his shadow long and thin under the moon. "Yes," the sharp-dressed tempter sighed, sniffing the bloom, "The scent of hope, a thing I have little use for, yet find... curious." "On the third night," the sharp-dressed tempter commanded, crushing the bloom in his hand, "you shall bring me from the meadow a single thing that holds a memory of sunlight." "A memory of sunlight?" stammered the youth with ink-stained fingers, utterly bewildered. "You heard me," the sharp-dressed tempter snapped, and vanished into the night, leaving the youth alone with his confusion.
The youth with ink-stained fingers was greatly troubled all the next day by the request for a memory of sunlight. As the third and final night fell, the youth with ink-stained fingers had no idea how he would find a memory of sunlight, but he knew he must somehow. He reached his hand deep inside the pouch for the third time, feeling the familiar grass. He wandered blind within the unseen meadow, seeking anything that felt like a memory of sunlight. He found a small, smooth pebble near where the hidden brooklet flowed, which felt warm to the touch, as if it held a memory of sunlight. He carefully pulled the pebble from the meadow and withdrew his hand. The sharp-dressed tempter appeared, his eyes gleaming with anticipation. "Here," said the youth with ink-stained fingers, holding out the small, warm pebble, "Something that holds a memory of sunlight." The sharp-dressed tempter took the pebble, felt its warmth, and a look of genuine surprise crossed his face. "Remarkable," the sharp-dressed tempter admitted, his usual smile less polished, "The debt is paid, the bargain met."
"I collect such things," the sharp-dressed tempter confided, holding the pebble, "A memory of sunlight, the scent of hope, the coolness of dew... they are threads by which I may grasp a feeling I cannot otherwise know, like the joy of the Princess in the tower." His gaze turned, and the youth with ink-stained fingers followed it, towards the distant city where a tall tower pierced the sky. "One last thing," the sharp-dressed tempter said, turning back, "A task of vigilance, for three nights more, you must watch over something for me." "Go to the city," the sharp-dressed tempter commanded, his voice low, "and watch the base of the Princess's tower, for there is a strange, pulsing shadow that gathers there." "For three nights," the sharp-dressed tempter instructed, "you must sit near it, unseen, and ensure that pulsing shadow does not grow larger, not by a finger's breadth." Though he understood little of shadows that grew, the youth with ink-stained fingers agreed to the task. "Fail," the sharp-dressed tempter's voice dropped to a whisper, "and your soul is forfeit, lost forever to the shadows." With that chilling word, the sharp-dressed tempter vanished once more. The youth with ink-stained fingers returned to the city and, near the base of the Princess's tall tower, found the strange, pulsing shadow.
He sat down, as unseen as possible, near the pulsing shadow, and began his watch. He noticed at once that the shadow pulsed with a quiet hunger, wanting to grow larger. But as the first night wore on, he found that simply holding the pouch, reaching in now and then to let the meadow's fresh air touch the shadow's edge, seemed to prevent it from growing. He did this again and again, feeling the cool air of the meadow on his skin and seeing the shadow shrink back slightly from its touch. By dawn, the pulsing shadow had not grown larger by a finger's breadth, and the youth with ink-stained fingers felt a strange weariness, but also a quiet triumph. He slept through the day, hidden in a quiet alleyway. As the second night fell, he returned to the base of the tower. The pulsing shadow pulsed stronger this time, and its edges seemed to reach further towards the tower. Again, the youth with ink-stained fingers held the pouch open, reaching in, letting the meadow's cool, living air push back against the shadow's heat. He saw actual flowers bloom for a moment at the shadow's edge where the meadow air touched it, and the darkness receded before the brief, vibrant life. By dawn, the pulsing shadow had still not grown larger by a finger's breadth, and the youth with ink-stained fingers was exhausted, but resolute.
He slept deeply through the next day, gathering his strength. As the third night fell, he returned to his post, finding the shadow at its most aggressive. The pulsing shadow pulsed violently, its edges licking outwards, seeming larger than ever before. The youth with ink-stained fingers held the pouch with both hands, reaching in again and again with all his might. The meadow within the pouch seemed to scream, the air roaring as it fought against the shadow's pressure, and the grass whipped and thrashed unseen within. The youth with ink-stained fingers focused his will, pouring his own desperate energy into the motion. The shadow pulsed and seethed, reaching like hungry fingers, but it still did not cross the invisible line where the meadow's defense held fast. Then, slowly, as dawn neared, the pulsing shadow began to shrink back upon itself, its hunger sated or perhaps defeated. By the time the first sun touched the tower, the shadow was no more than a dark stain upon the ground, and it had not grown larger.
The three nights' watch was finished, and his soul was safe from the sharp-dressed tempter. He knew, suddenly, that the sharp-dressed tempter had wanted that shadow to grow, that it was meant to harm the Princess in her tower, and he, the failed art student, had stopped it. He would no longer flee paint-sellers; he would seek out the Princess in the tower. He went back to his poor hut on the edge of the city, reached into the pouch, and drank deeply of the meadow's coolness. Then, using the dew and vibrant petals pulled from the meadow, he mixed the brightest pigments he had ever seen. With these, the youth with ink-stained fingers painted a picture of the Princess's tower, with the dark, defeated shadow at its base. Soon after, he heard a proclamation from the stone-faced King: his fair-haired maiden, the Princess, would throw a golden apple in the royal gardens, and whoever caught it could ask for her hand. The youth with ink-stained fingers knew this was his chance; he took his painting, still wet with magical dew, and went to the royal gardens. The gardens were full of knights in shining armor and proud princes, all vying for the fair-haired maiden's attention. The youth with ink-stained fingers stood quietly apart, holding his painting, and did not vie for the princess's eye. Then, the fair-haired maiden, the Princess, came out, lovely as the dawn, and held up the golden apple.
But the fair-haired maiden's eye fell upon the youth with ink-stained fingers and the strange, vibrant painting he held. Intrigued, she came down from her platform and approached the youth with ink-stained fingers. She gazed upon the painting and saw the tower, and the shadow, and in her heart, she knew the story it told. She turned to the stone-faced King and said, "Father, I will not throw the apple." "Why not?" asked the stone-faced King, his voice rumbling like distant thunder. "Because," said the fair-haired maiden, pointing to the youth with ink-stained fingers, "he who painted this picture is the one I choose." The stone-faced King looked from the painting to the youth, and back again, and then, surprisingly, nodded. "So be it," rumbled the stone-faced King, "You have won my daughter's hand." And so, the youth with ink-stained fingers, no longer a failure, took the hand of the fair-haired maiden, the Princess. And they lived happily ever after, the Princess cherishing the painting, and the youth with ink-stained fingers finding endless inspiration in the meadow pouch.
