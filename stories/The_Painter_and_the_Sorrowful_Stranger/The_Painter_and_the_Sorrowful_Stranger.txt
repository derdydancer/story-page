The Painter and the Sorrowful Stranger
There was once a youth who had been a student of art in a great city, but he found no success and dwelt in a poor chamber. He painted many pictures, but could sell none, and so he often went hungry. One day he said to himself, 'I will paint no more, but go forth and seek any common work that will give me bread.' So he left his poor chamber and went into the city streets to look for a master. But he walked all day and could find no master, for no one had need of such a one who knew only how to hold a brush. When evening came, he had no food and no bed, and he sat down upon a dark street corner in despair. On a sudden, a stranger in fine, dark clothes stood before him and said, 'Youth, why do you sit here so sadly?' The youth looked up and answered, 'Sir, I am a painter without bread, and today I can find no work at all.' The stranger smiled and said, 'If you are a painter, perhaps you can paint for me, and I shall give you good wages.' The youth agreed at once, for he was hungry and saw no other hope before him that night.
Then the stranger led the youth from the dark streets to a grand house on a quiet square. Inside were many fine rooms with rich carpets on the floors and golden lamps hanging from the ceilings. The stranger bade a servant bring food, and soon the youth ate good meat and drank fine wine, such as he had not tasted for many months. 'Now,' said the stranger when the youth had eaten, 'tomorrow you shall paint a portrait for me, and it must be a true likeness of the one I show you.' The youth said he would do it gladly, for the food and wine had made him feel strong and eager to hold his brushes once more. Then the stranger gave him the finest brushes, all manner of bright colors, and a fine canvas stretched upon a wooden frame. He was then led to a chamber with a soft bed, where he slept soundly until the morning. When morning came, the stranger took him to a well-lit room and said, 'It is myself you shall paint today.' The stranger sat in a great chair before a dark curtain, and the youth set up his canvas and began to paint with great care. But try as he might, he could not capture the likeness of the stranger, for the man's face seemed to change subtly each time he looked upon it.
All day the youth toiled, his brow furrowed, while the stranger sat patiently and watched him with a keen eye, but said nothing. When evening fell, the picture was a poor thing, and looked not at all like the stranger who had commissioned it. The stranger looked upon it with a faint smile and said only, 'You will try again tomorrow.' The youth's heart was heavy, for it seemed his art had failed him yet again, even with the finest of tools. The second day was much like the first; the youth painted with all his skill, but the stranger's face, with the shifting light in his eyes, remained beyond his grasp. And when evening came again, the portrait was a disappointment, showing a face that was handsome, yet not the true face of his host. Again, the stranger looked upon it with that same faint smile and said, 'Tomorrow, you shall try for the third time.' Now the youth began to be afraid, for the stranger's patience was unsettling, and he knew not what would happen if he failed a third time. He slept little that night, and thought and thought of how he might capture that face which seemed made of shadow and changing light. On the third morning, the youth took up his brushes again, knowing this might be his final chance before his strange host.
This time, he did not try to paint the exact features before him, but rather the unsettling feeling and the dark power he sensed from the man. As he worked, the stranger's faint smile seemed to deepen, and his eyes gleamed with a light the youth had not seen there before. When the third portrait was finished, it was a strange picture, not a true likeness in form, yet it held a terrible power and a deep shadow of the man. The stranger looked at it for a long time, then nodded slowly and said, 'This one, though not my face as others see it, has a truth to it.' He then gave the youth a purse heavy with gold coins, far more than he had ever dreamed of possessing. 'You may stay here in my house,' said the stranger, 'and paint for me when I have need, and you shall want for nothing.' The youth agreed readily, for the fear of hunger was gone, and he now had a patron who valued his strange new way of seeing. So the youth lived in comfort in the grand house, and painted many pictures for the stranger, often of strange and shadowy things the man would describe. His fame grew in the city as a painter of powerful and dark visions, though none knew for whom he worked or where he truly dwelt. Yet sometimes, when alone in his fine room, the youth would feel a strange disquiet, as if the grand house were a beautiful, gilded cage.
Many years passed, and the youth became known throughout the land as a master painter, though he still painted only what the stranger wished. The stranger, who never seemed to age, came to him one day and said, 'Now you shall paint a maiden for me, one I knew long ago, and I will describe her to you.' The stranger spoke for many hours, and his words were full of a strange sorrow as he described her hair like spun moonlight and eyes like the evening star. The painter listened carefully, trying to see her in his mind, for this was the first time the stranger had shown such deep feeling about any subject. When he took up his brushes, his hand moved with a new swiftness, as if another guided his strokes upon the canvas. The portrait that emerged was the most beautiful he had ever made; the maiden on the canvas seemed to breathe, so full of life and sorrowful grace was she. When the stranger saw it, he gazed at it for a long, silent time, and a great sigh escaped him, like a winter wind through a ruined hall. 'It is she,' he whispered, his voice thick with unshed tears. 'The very likeness of the one I loved, and who is now lost to me forever.' He gave the painter another, heavier purse of gold, but then a dark mood fell upon him, and he bade the youth leave him alone with the painting. The painter now had great wealth and fame, yet he saw clearly the deep sorrow of his powerful master, and wondered at the peculiar services that brought him such reward.
After the painting of the sorrowful maiden, the stranger grew more somber and his tasks for the painter became fewer. The painter, having much gold and fewer duties, began to walk much about the city, observing the lives of the common folk at their work and play. He saw much poverty and unfairness there, and this was not like the gilded rooms and endless supply of fine things in the stranger's house. He began to draw in secret, in a little book he carried, the faces of the poor, the children playing in the gutters, and old women selling herbs. These drawings were different from his grand paintings; they had a light and a kindness in them that his famous, shadowy canvases lacked. One day, the stranger came upon him as he was sketching an old beggarman, and saw the little book filled with these new images. The stranger took the book and looked at each page for a long time, while his face showed no anger, nor pleasure either. At last he closed it and said, 'You have learned to see with two eyes now. For your next work, you shall paint a grand canvas that shows both the shadows I have taught you, and this new light you have found for yourself.' The painter felt a great unease, for how could he mix such darkness with such tenderness upon one canvas without one destroying the other? But the stranger offered no help, only saying, 'That is for you, the master painter, to discover. I wish to see it thus.'
With great trepidation, the painter prepared his largest canvas yet, for the stranger's request filled him with both dread and a flicker of excitement. For many days he toiled in vain; the dark parts he painted would swallow the light, or the light parts would make the shadows seem merely like stage props. The stranger would come each evening to look upon the troubled canvas, his face unreadable, and depart without a word. One night, the painter fell asleep exhausted before his canvas, and he dreamed the sorrowful maiden from the portrait stood before him, holding a small, intricately wrought silver key. He awoke with a start, the image of the key still in his mind, and with feverish haste, he began to paint the maiden into the center of his vast, chaotic canvas. Miraculously, as he painted her sorrowful beauty, the darkness and the light began to find their place around her, no longer at war, but in a strange, poignant harmony. The finished canvas was his masterpiece: it held both the terror of the abyss he had learned from the stranger, and the tenderness of a single human tear he had found in the city's streets. When the stranger saw this painting, he stood before it for a full hour in utter silence, and on his face was an expression of awe the painter had never witnessed before. 'You have painted my own soul,' the stranger finally said, his voice strangely soft. 'My shadows and my lost light. Your work for me is finished. You are free to go.' He then declared that the house and all its riches were now the painter's, and turning, the stranger walked into the deepest shadow of the room and vanished as if he were smoke.
The painter stood alone in the silent, opulent house, a master of great wealth, yet he knew not what to do with his days or his new, strange freedom. He took up his brushes to paint the cheerful market scenes he had once sketched in secret, but his hand would not obey; it produced only grand, sorrowful images of twilight and despair. If he tried to paint a smiling child, its eyes would fill with an ancient grief; if he painted a sunlit field, shadows would creep in to devour the light. The city hailed these new works as his most profound, yet the painter looked upon them with a cold dread, for they were not his own. He understood then that the stranger, in vanishing, had not truly freed him but had instead left a part of his own eternal sorrow to be expressed through the painter's hand. In a fit of despair, he tried to burn the canvases and smash the opulent furnishings, but found the paintings would not catch fire and his arms had no strength to break even the smallest vase. Only the portrait of the sorrowful maiden, which hung in the main hall, seemed to watch him with eyes full of an unchanging, gentle pity. He remembered the dream of the silver key, and knew it had not been a key to his art, but perhaps the very key to the stranger's timeless prison of grief, which he now shared. He was rich, he was lauded, yet he was no longer his own master, but a mere vessel through which an ancient, unhealing sorrow poured onto canvas after canvas. And the more tormented and shadowed his paintings became, the more the great city lauded his genius, praising his unflinching gaze into the abyss of the human soul.
In his gilded prison, the painter one day resolved to seek help, and he went to the old parts of the city where wise men and women were said to dwell. He told them of the stranger and the art that flowed unwillingly from his hand, but they could only shake their heads in awe or fear, offering no remedy. Only one very old woman, who lived in a tiny room filled with dried herbs and strange maps, listened to his whole tale and then said, 'The hand that serves sorrow must itself taste the bitterest tears of truth.' 'You must paint what you truly are, or what you were when your own heart first broke,' she croaked, 'before the dark master found you. Paint that despair, and paint it with the hand that now serves another.' The painter felt a chill far colder than any the stranger had evoked, for this task meant dredging up a shame he thought long buried by gold and dark renown. He returned to his grand house, which now seemed a tomb adorned with his own cursed talents, and knew he must attempt this one last, terrible portrait. He locked himself in his studio for seven days and seven nights, and neither ate nor slept, but wrestled with the canvas, his hand sometimes slick with the stranger's sorrow, sometimes trembling with his own forgotten truth. At last, on the seventh morning, he stepped back from a small, plain canvas depicting a youth in a bare garret, his eyes hollow with hunger, surrounded by unsold, hopeful pictures. As he gazed upon this raw image of his own forgotten despair, the opulent room around him began to tremble, and the rich tapestries seemed to thin like mist. The portrait of the sorrowful maiden across the hall shimmered, and for an instant, her painted lips curved into a soft, true smile before she and all the dark splendors of the house dissolved into gray dust.
The painter found himself again in his old, bare chamber, the small, honest painting of the starving student clutched in his hand, the years of dark fame and gold naught but dust. He was weak and hungry as he had been on that first fateful night, yet his painting hand felt strangely light, and the oppressive shadow that had guided it for so long was gone. He took the small painting of his youthful despair, and with the one dusty coin he found in his pocket from before his strange service, he bought a crust of bread. Then, in his bare room, he began to paint again: not the grand, shadowed visions that had made him famous, but small, quiet pictures of the city's life, filled with a gentle, knowing light. These paintings sold for only a few coins apiece, barely enough for his bread and his paints, but those who bought them felt a curious warmth and a sense of shared humanity. He was no longer the celebrated master of shadows, nor did he dwell in opulence, but the painter was content, for his hand was at last his own. He kept the little painting of the starving student on his wall, and sometimes he would look at it and remember the grand house, the sorrowful maiden, and the stranger with eyes like dying stars. The great city soon forgot its celebrated painter of grand and terrible visions, and few ever connected his name with the quiet old man who sold small, gentle pictures in the market square. He lived many more years, always poor, always painting, and though his famous name was lost to time, his small pictures brought moments of unexpected light to the ordinary folk who bought them for a coin or two. And so the painter, who had once supped with a strange master in a house of shadows, found his truest sustenance at last in the simple light of his own small, honest art, and painted thus until his days were ended.
