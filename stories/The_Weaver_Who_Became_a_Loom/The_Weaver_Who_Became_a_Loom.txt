The Weaver Who Became a Loom
There once lived a weaver in a small cottage by the edge of a town. He was known for his skill, and his cloth was sought by many, though he earned but a modest living. He worked from sunup till sundown at his great wooden loom, the shuttle flying back and forth like a swift bird.
One evening, as dusk fell, an old woman with eyes like chips of flint came to his door. She was bent and cloaked, and she carried a small, curiously carved spindle. "Weaver," she rasped, "you slighted my sister in the market square today. You laughed when she stumbled and dropped her wares. For your mockery, you shall learn humility."
The weaver protested he remembered no such thing, but the old woman raised the spindle. "By the warp and the weft," she chanted, "by the thread and the thrum! When the moon is hidden dark, your form shall be undone! You shall know the wood's cold heart, the tension of the spun!"
Then she was gone. The weaver, troubled, barred his door and went to bed. But when the moon was new and the night blackest, he awoke not in his bed, but standing rigid in the corner where his loom stood. He *was* the loom. He felt the grain of his own wooden frame, the tightness of the warp threads stretched upon him, the cold metal of the heddles. He could not move, could not speak, only stand and wait. When dawn came, he found himself back in his bed, trembling, the loom standing silent as ever.
This happened each dark moon. He tried staying awake, locking himself out, but always he awoke as the loom. His work suffered, for he feared the cycle. Then came a month when, as the loom, he felt a hand touch his frame. It was his neighbour, a poor widow, come early to borrow a spool of thread. Finding the door unlocked, she had crept in. As she touched the loom, seeking the thread basket nearby, the weaver felt a strange connection. He could suddenly impress a thought into her mind: *Help me.*
The widow started, looking around the empty room. She felt the thought again, stronger, seeming to come from the loom itself. Being a simple woman, she did not question the magic, but asked aloud, "Loom, how can I help you?"
The weaver-loom impressed another thought: *Find the spindle woman. Offer service.*
The widow, though afraid, agreed. She searched the town and the paths around, asking for an old woman with flint eyes and a carved spindle. At last, she found her cottage, deep in the woods. The widow knocked timidly.
"What do you want?" screeched the spindle woman.
"I come on behalf of the weaver," said the widow. "He offers his service to undo the curse."
The old woman cackled. "Service, is it? Very well. Let him, in his loom-form, weave me a cloth of moonlight and shadow, soft as moss but strong as iron. Let it be done ere the next dark moon returns."
The widow brought the message back. The weaver despaired. How could he weave as a loom? But the widow said, "Perhaps you guide, and I work?"
So, on the next dark moon, the widow came to the cottage. The weaver stood rigid, as the loom. But this time, as the widow sat before him, he found he could guide her hands. He impressed thoughts: *This thread. Pull tighter. Pass the shuttle now. Shift the heddle.* Slowly, painstakingly, through the long nights leading up to the dark moon, they worked whenever the weaver was transformed. The widow brought threads spun from wool dyed darkest black, and others bleached white as bone. Under the weaver-loom's mental guidance, she wove a cloth of strange beauty, patterned like dappled moonlight on the forest floor. It felt soft, yet resisted tearing.
On the day before the dark moon, the widow took the cloth to the spindle woman. The old woman examined it closely, rubbing it, pulling it. "It is done," she grudgingly admitted. She handed the widow the carved spindle. "Break this upon his threshold at moonrise. But tell the weaver: mockery finds strange echoes."
The widow hurried back. As the moon hid its face and the weaver felt the change begin, the widow stood at his cottage door and snapped the spindle across the threshold stone. There was a crack like breaking ice, and the weaver felt himself stumble forward, fully human again, the transformation halted forever.
He thanked the widow with tears in his eyes, and shared his earnings with her from that day forward. He never again laughed at another's misfortune, remembering the cold heart of the wood and the tension of the threads. The loom remained in the corner, but now it seemed just a tool once more, silent and waiting.
