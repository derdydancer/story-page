The Riddles of the Grumpy Giant and the Clever Youth
Once upon a time, in a certain land, there lived a king who was known for his great wealth. And his kingdom was a peaceful one, with fertile fields and bustling towns, where the people lived contentedly enough. Alas, the king had grown old, and though his coffers were full, he fretted for he had no heir of wit and sense to rule after him. His daughter, the princess, often sat at her high window, gazing out over the town and the distant fields. She leaned from the casement and in a clear voice, for all to hear, she sang: 'I have a lock but own no door, I have a spine but feel no sore. What am I, that clever men might know?' Then a richly dressed fool, with more coins in his purse than sense in his head, strutted forth beneath her window. The richly dressed fool puffed out his chest and declared loudly, 'Marry, princess, the answer must be a purple turnip wearing a very small hat!' The princess sighed a little sigh, and shaking her head, she turned away from the window, for no true suitor had yet appeared that day. In another part of the land, there lived a miller, who was well-to-do but not overly rich, with a sturdy mill that stood by a chuckling stream. Now, this miller had a son who was quick-witted and loved riddles more than bread, but alas, he was of little use in the dusty work of the mill itself.
One morning, the youth, instead of fetching sacks of grain, posed a riddle to his father: 'I have cities, but no houses; forests, but no trees; and water, but no fish. What am I?' The miller stroked his chin, looked at his son's dreamy eyes, and said, 'Aye, riddles are fine, but they don't grind flour. Perhaps the world has more use for your tongue than my mill does; go see if you can riddle your way to a warm supper elsewhere!' So the youth, with no more than the clothes on his back and a hopeful heart (though his father's words still echoed comically in his ears), set out to seek his fortune. He had not walked far when he met an old woman, wrinkled as a dried apple, who sat by the path and asked, 'Whither away so fast, young master?' The youth replied, 'Good mother, I seek my fortune, but in truth, I know not whither I am bound today.' The old woman threw back her head and cackled, a sound like dry leaves skittering, and said, 'Lost you may be, but honest you are, and that's a start right enough!' From her bag she then pulled a bent spoon, a leaky thimble, and a small, rather featherless stuffed bird, saying, 'Take these, young master, and keep them safe, for even the silliest-seeming things have their day.' Then she cackled again, pressed the items into his hand, and vanished into the twilight as suddenly as she had appeared. As dusk fell, the youth came upon a modest inn by the roadside and asked for a room and a bite to eat. The innkeeper, a man with keen eyes and a sly glint, then said, 'Young sir, you seem a bright lad; I'll wager your purse that you cannot tell me what has keys but opens no locks, has a space but no room, and you can enter but not go outside?'
The youth, after puzzling for a time, guessed it was a story, but alas, the innkeeper shook his head. The innkeeper, chuckling, then swept the youth's few coins into his apron, declaring the wager won fair and square. The youth, now penniless and bewildered by the fast-talking innkeeper, sat down by the roadside under a tree and scratched his head. As he sat, a billy goat with a long, thoughtful beard was nibbling at the grass nearby, and then it looked up and said, 'A long journey for a lad with empty pockets, eh?' The goat then looked him in the eye and said, 'Mark ye well, when words are chains and silence breaks the lock, only a fool answers what is not truly asked.' With a final, wise nod, the goat then trotted off and began chewing thoughtfully on a thistle, saying no more. At length, after following the goat's rather rambling directions, the youth arrived at a grand castle with banners flying. He was welcomed kindly and given food and rest, yet though all seemed well, the youth perceived an air of unspoken worry about the place. So the youth turned to the princess and asked, 'Fair maiden, your castle is grand and your welcome kind, yet I sense a shadow here; pray tell, what troubles this bright land?' The princess sighed, and said, 'Alas, a grumpy giant lives in the mountains nearby, and he plagues us with vexing demands, which he will only cease if a worthy champion can answer him three riddles, a feat no one has yet achieved.'
The giant chuckled, a sound like grinding stones, and said, 'Hark ye then, little morsel! I am always running but never walk, often murmur but never talk, have a bed but never sleep, have a mouth but never speak. What am I?' The youth grinned and said, 'Why, that is a river, for it is always running but never walks, has a mouth but never talks, and a bed but never sleeps!' When the youth gave the answer, the giant's jaw dropped so low it nearly touched his knees, and his eyes bulged like two bewildered turnips. The giant, clearing his throat with a sound like rocks tumbling, then asked his second riddle: 'I have no voice, yet I speak to all. I tell of joy, and of sorrow's call. The more I am looked at, the less I am seen. What am I?' The youth replied without hesitation, 'It is a shadow, for it has no voice but follows all, and grows longer as the sun goes down,' and the giant's already long face fell even further. Then the giant puffed out his chest and boomed, 'Now for the last! I speak without a mouth and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with wind. What am I?' The youth, after a moment's thought, smiled and gave the answer to the third and hardest riddle: 'It is a secret kept by a friend, for it grows heavier the more it is shared, yet lighter for the one who first held it.' The giant, hearing the answer to his last and most difficult riddle, roared not with anger but with surprise, and then with a great laugh, he shrunk down to the size of a toadstool and hopped away into the deep woods, never to be seen again. The king, delighted by such wit that had freed them all from the giant's vexing demands, declared, 'You shall have my daughter's hand and half my kingdom besides!' And so the clever youth married the princess, and they ruled the kingdom with laughter and good sense for many a year.
