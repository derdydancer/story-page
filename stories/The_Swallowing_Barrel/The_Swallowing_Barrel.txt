The Swallowing Barrel
There was once a king whose kingdom was sorely pressed by war with a neighboring land. Now this king spent his days not in council, but in his workshop, where he devised many strange and useless machines for battle. One day he built a great catapult that flung scalding porridge, thinking to dismay the enemy with breakfast. The porridge hit no one but his own forward guards, and the enemy laughed heartily from their trenches. In that kingdom lived a poor miller's son, dwelling in a small hut by the edge of the forest that bordered the troubled land. He worked hard at his father's mill, but there was little grain to grind, for the war took its toll upon the fields. One morning, while gathering firewood, he stumbled upon an old wooden barrel half-buried amongst the tree roots. He thought it might serve to fetch water, so he dragged it free and tipped out the dirt and leaves within. Instantly the dirt vanished into the wood itself with a sound like a great gulp. The miller's son pushed a stone against it, and the stone vanished too, leaving the wood smooth as before.
The miller's son looked about, saw no one, and quickly rolled the strange barrel back towards his hut. He reached the hut and found his father groaning upon his pallet, struck by a sudden fever. The miller's son thought a moment, then carefully rolled the barrel close to his father's side. He whispered to the barrel, "Swallow the heat," and touched its rim to his father's brow. The father sighed deeply as if a weight was lifted, and when the miller's son looked, the fever was gone and his father slept peacefully. Meanwhile, at the palace, the king unveiled his newest invention: suits of armour made from hardened biscuits, guaranteed, he said, to repel arrows. The first soldier to wear it into a skirmish was shot, and the arrow went clean through the biscuit breastplate, so he fell down like a crumbled cake. Word spread through the nearby villages of the miller's father's sudden recovery, and soon reached the ears of the king. The king, tired of his own failures, sent guards to fetch the miller's son, for he wished to know of this strange cure. The miller's son went to the palace as commanded, and he rolled the wooden barrel carefully before him.
He stood before the king in the great hall, who asked him straightway, "Is it true you possess a cure for the fever that plagued your father?" The miller's son looked at his barrel and answered, "Lord King, this barrel helped my father feel well." The king's daughter, a fair maiden, stood nearby behind a pillar and watched the miller's son and the strange barrel with keen eyes. "A barrel that helps?" said the king, stroking his beard, "Perhaps it can help with the enemy's great war-horn that blasts so loud it frightens my biscuit-armoured soldiers?" "Take your barrel to the front lines tomorrow, miller's son, and if you can swallow the sound of that horn, you will have a sack of gold." The miller's son agreed readily, for the sack of gold would be welcome, and he rolled his barrel away. The next day, upon the battle lines, the enemy blew their great horn, and its terrible blast echoed across the field, making the king's soldiers tremble. The miller's son rolled the barrel forward, pointed its opening towards the sound, and whispered, "Swallow the noise!" The horn's sound cut off mid-blast as if choked, and a sudden silence fell upon the field, while the enemy horn-blower looked about bewildered. The king was greatly pleased and gave the miller's son the sack of gold as promised.
But the enemy grew cunning, and seeing their horn silenced, they diverted a great river so its waters rose and threatened the king's castle itself. The king was dismayed, but quickly set his carpenters to building enormous wooden ducks with paddle-wheel feet, hoping they would drink the floodwaters. The ducks were launched upon the rising water, where they bobbed uselessly and span in circles, drinking nothing at all. The king turned again to the miller's son and commanded, "Use that barrel that swallows things, and swallow this flood before we are all drowned!" "If you succeed," the king promised, "You shall have the finest farmland in my kingdom and the title of Baron." The miller's son went to the edge of the flood where the water roared against the castle walls, and rolled his barrel to the brink. He pointed the opening towards the brown churning waves and cried loudly, "Swallow the water!" The barrel began to gulp and gurgle, and the water rushed towards it, spinning into a great whirlpool that sank into the barrel's mouth. Soon the floodwaters lowered, leaving muddy fields behind, and the king's castle was safe once more. The king kept his word, gave him the rich farmland, and named him Baron Miller's Son before the whole court.
Now it was told in secret whispers that the Devil himself aided the enemy king, lending him dark magic for mischief and malice. He gave the enemy warriors of shadow and smoke who could not be killed by sword or arrow, and they slew many of the king's best soldiers. The king was in despair, for his machines were useless against such foes, and his soldiers fell like wheat before the scythe. He summoned Baron Miller's Son and implored him, "Your barrel swallows noise and water; can it swallow these shadow warriors whom no weapon can harm?" "If you save my kingdom now," said the king, his voice trembling, "You shall have my daughter's hand in marriage and sit beside me on the throne." The new Baron agreed, though he knew not if wood could swallow smoke, and went once more to the battle with his barrel. He met the enemy host, and the shadow warriors drifted forward, shapes of smoke with glowing red eyes, and swords passed right through them while they cut down soldiers left and right. Baron Miller's Son rolled the barrel into their midst and cried, "Swallow the shadows!" The barrel let out a great sighing wind, and the shadow warriors were pulled towards it, swirling like smoke up a chimney until every one had vanished inside. The rest of the enemy army, seeing their champions gone, turned and fled, and the king's soldiers pursued them far, and won the day.
Baron Miller's Son returned to the palace, and the king gladly gave him the princess's hand in marriage. A great wedding feast was held, with music and dancing, and tables groaning with food and wine for all the court. But suddenly the doors burst open with a gust of smoke and brimstone, and the Devil himself stood there, his eyes like burning coals, furious at the loss of his shadow warriors. "You! Miller's son, or Baron now," he roared, pointing a clawed finger, "I know it was you and your cursed barrel! Give it to me!" The Baron replied calmly, though all others trembled, "The barrel is mine, won through service to the king, and I will not give it to you." "Then you and this whole flimsy kingdom shall suffer!" shrieked the Devil, and he stamped his cloven hoof so the floor cracked beneath it. But quick as thought, the Baron thrust the barrel forward, holding it straight at the fiend, and shouted, "Swallow the Devil!" There was a great sucking noise like wind down a narrow passage, and the Devil howled as he was drawn feet first into the barrel's mouth and vanished entirely. The smell of brimstone faded, the cracked floor smoothed over, and the hall was quiet again save for the relieved sighs of the court. The Baron took the barrel, which now felt heavy and pulsed faintly, carried it far away, and sank it in the deepest part of the sea weighted with great stones.
From that day on, the kingdom knew peace, and the war with the neighboring land ended, for their dark helper was gone. The old king eventually died of a surfeit of celebratory cake, and the Baron ruled wisely in his stead with the princess at his side. As for the old king's inventions, the biscuit armour was fed to the pigs, and the porridge catapult was used for firewood. The new king did not waste time on foolish machines, but solved problems directly and listened to his people. And the barrel with the Devil inside still lies at the bottom of the deepest sea, troubling the world no more. Now, some say that barrel was the first way problems were truly made to disappear. For when a worry or a trouble is so great it cannot be fixed or fought, it is best forgotten entirely, like it went into the Baron's barrel. Just as the noise, the flood, the shadows, and the Devil himself were swallowed without a trace, never to be seen again. And so, to this very day, when something troublesome vanishes completely or is utterly ruined and disposed of... we always say, "That's gone down the Swallowing Barrel!"
