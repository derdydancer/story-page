The River That Flows Backward
In a kingdom where no rain had fallen for three years, there lived an old woman who grew more bent and withered with each passing day, just as the land around her cracked and thirsted for water that would not come. Few remembered that this woman had once been the most beautiful maiden in seven kingdoms, or that her aging was no ordinary process, for she had discovered long ago that with each kindness she performed for others, a year would fall away from her life, moving her backward through time toward her youth. Though she longed to help her suffering neighbors, the old woman had grown cautious with her kindnesses, for she had seen how beauty could corrupt as easily as bless, and she feared what might happen if she returned too far toward her youth, when her heart had been less wise and her beauty had brought both adoration and envy in equal measure.

One evening as the old woman sat by her empty well, a young prince appeared at her garden gate, his fine clothes torn and dusty from travel, his eyes bright with intelligence but his speech strange and twisted, for he spoke only in riddles that made the simplest request sound like ancient prophecy. "Where waters climb instead of fall and yesterday becomes tomorrow," said the prince when the old woman asked his purpose, "there lies the cup that quenches all, but only hands that give may borrow." The old woman's eyes widened, for she alone in the kingdom remembered the ancient tales of a river far to the north that flowed backward one day each year, when the moon was new and the stars formed a crown in the night sky – a day that would come again in less than a fortnight.

Seeing the prince's parched lips and desperate eyes, the old woman brought him her last cup of water saved for her own thirst, and as he drank, one of the deep lines in her face smoothed away, her back straightened ever so slightly, and her white hair showed a single streak of the chestnut color it had once been. Through careful questions requiring only nods or shakes of the head, the old woman learned that the prince had been cursed by a jealous sorcerer to speak only in riddles until he could drink from waters that flowed against nature's law, and that he sought the backward-flowing river not only to break his curse but to bring water to his own kingdom, which suffered as greatly as hers.

"I will guide you to the river," said the old woman, going to a chest long unopened, from which she withdrew two objects: a pair of worn leather boots that seemed to shift direction as if eager to walk, and a small silver mirror that showed not her reflection but swirling mist that occasionally parted to reveal glimpses of distant places and times. "These boots will walk only toward what your heart truly desires," she told the prince as they set out at dawn, "and this mirror shows not what is but what might be if certain paths are taken – together they have never failed to guide me, though I have not used them in more years than I can count."
For seven days they traveled, the old woman growing visibly younger with each kindness she showed the prince – finding water in seemingly dry places, sharing what little food she had, easing his blistered feet with herbs she gathered along the way – until by the seventh day, her back was straight, her hair more brown than white, and her hands, though still worn with work, had lost their gnarled appearance. On the eighth day, they came to a vast chasm too wide to cross, with no bridge in sight and the distant sound of water far below – a sound that made the prince's eyes light with hope despite the impossible barrier before them.

"The boots will not lead us astray if what we seek is truly what our hearts desire," said the old woman, now looking more like a matron in her middle years, and taking the prince's hand, she stepped confidently into empty air – whereupon the boots carried them both across the chasm as if walking on solid ground, each step creating a momentary flash of golden light that faded as soon as their feet moved forward. By the tenth day, they reached a forest where every path looked identical, the trees shifting position when not directly observed, and even the sun seemed to move erratically in the sky, making it impossible to maintain direction toward the distant mountains where the river was said to flow.

The old woman, now with only a few strands of gray in her chestnut hair, held up the silver mirror, which showed not their reflections but a path glowing blue through the confusing forest and, more disturbingly, dark shapes moving among the trees – shapes that seemed to be following them with patient malice. "Shadow-seekers," whispered the woman, her voice tight with fear, "servants of the sorcerer who cursed you – they hunt for those who seek to undo their master's work, and they can smell magic and hope from leagues away."

For two days and nights they hurried through the forest, following the blue path visible only in the mirror, stopping only when absolutely necessary, the boots pulling them ever northward while the shadows gained ground behind them, their whispers like dry leaves scraping against stone in the darkness. On the morning of the thirteenth day, they stumbled exhausted from the forest edge to the shore of a small lake, clear as crystal and perfectly round, where a fish with scales of silver and gold leapt from the water and spoke in a voice like distant bells: "Quickly now, into the water, for shadow-seekers cannot cross living water, and I have much to tell you before the day of backward flow arrives."

Safe in the shallow water, the woman – now youthful with only the wisdom in her eyes revealing her true age – and the prince listened as the fish explained: "The river flows backward only from midnight to midnight tomorrow, and its water can break any curse and heal any ill, but it must be gathered in a vessel that has never been used for selfish purpose, and the one who gathers it must stand against the current, facing what was rather than what will be." "I have such a vessel," said the fish, producing from the lake bed a small cup of carved crystal, "but I will give it only in exchange for that which you value most – not your boots or mirror, woman who grows younger, but a single act of kindness that may cost you everything you have regained."
Without hesitation, the woman – who now appeared as she had in the prime of her life – reached out and touched the fish's wounded fin, a injury she had noticed but not mentioned, and as healing flowed from her fingers, decades returned to her body in an instant, her hair whitening, her back bending, her hands growing gnarled once more, though her eyes remained kind and clear. "You have passed the test that many fail," said the fish, its fin now whole and gleaming, as it placed the crystal cup in the old woman's weathered hand, "for you gave without calculation of cost, and now this vessel, which has never held anything but tears of compassion, will serve your purpose at the backward-flowing river."

The fish guided them to a hidden path leading directly to the mountains, and though the woman was once again old and tired, she refused the prince's offers to rest, for the new moon would rise that very night, and they had less than half a day to reach the river before its waters began to flow backward. As the sun began to set, they crested a final ridge and looked down upon a valley where a silver ribbon of water curved between steep banks of black stone, the river flowing normally for now, but the air around it seeming to shimmer with anticipation, as if the very elements knew that something extraordinary was about to occur.

They had just begun their descent toward the river when darkness pooled before them, solidifying into the form of a tall figure in a black cloak, his face hidden but his voice cold as winter frost: "So the cursed prince and the aging woman think to undo my work with river water and kindness – how disappointing that you have come so far only to fail within sight of your goal." With a gesture, the sorcerer froze the prince in mid-step and turned to the old woman, saying, "I will offer you a choice that is no choice at all – surrender the boots and mirror to me and return home alone, or watch as I turn your princely friend to stone forever, for while you have grown old again through your foolish kindness, I have grown stronger feeding on the shadows of despair that your drought-stricken kingdoms produce so abundantly."

The old woman looked at the sorcerer calmly, then held up the silver mirror so that it caught the last ray of sunset, saying, "Before I decide, see what might be if you continue on this path," and when the sorcerer instinctively looked into the mirror's surface, he saw not possibilities but his own reflection, twisted with hatred and fear – the first true reflection he had seen in centuries of avoiding all mirrored surfaces. The sorcerer screamed as his own reflection trapped him in the mirror's surface, his power turning inward upon itself, for his greatest spell had always been to hide from his own true nature, and now, forced to confront what he had become, he dissolved into the same shadows he had commanded, leaving behind only a faint echo of wailing that faded into the gathering darkness.

The prince unfroze with a gasp as the moon rose above the mountains, and together they hurried down to the riverbank, where the water was already beginning to slow, the current growing confused as if forgetting which way it was meant to flow. As midnight struck – marked by nothing but a feeling in the air, a momentary pause in the world's breathing – the river stopped completely, its surface becoming as smooth as the mirror the old woman still clutched, and then, with a sound like soft laughter, the water began to flow backward, upstream toward its source in the mountains, carrying leaves and twigs and memory itself against the normal course of time.
Following the fish's instructions, the old woman waded carefully into the cold water, facing upstream – or what had been upstream before the reversal – and filled the crystal cup with water that flowed against nature's law, the liquid glowing faintly blue in the moonlight as if containing stars. When the prince drank from the cup, the water glowed briefly in his throat before he gasped and spoke his first unriddled words: "Thank you, kind woman, for helping me when no one else would or could – your sacrifice and wisdom have freed me from a prison of words that none could understand."

The prince looked more closely at his companion in the moonlight and recognition dawned in his eyes: "You are the Lady Elara, are you not? The beauty whose portrait still hangs in my father's castle, who disappeared fifty years ago when suitors fought duels for your favor – but how can this be?" "I am she," admitted the old woman, "though I left that name behind long ago when I discovered that my beauty brought only pain and jealousy to myself and others – I learned that giving kindness, even at the cost of that beauty, brought more joy than all the adoration I once received, and so I have lived, growing younger when I helped others and older when I kept to myself, always seeking balance between wisdom and strength."

Though the prince offered her the remaining water, suggesting it might restore her youth permanently if she drank it herself, the woman shook her head and carefully preserved the glowing liquid in the crystal cup, saying, "This water must return to our kingdoms to end the drought – my age is but a number, while the thirst of our people is a present pain we can now relieve." Throughout the night they worked together, the prince gathering additional water in his water skin and whatever containers they could fashion, while the woman directed him to the places where the backward flow ran strongest and purest, both knowing that when dawn came, the river would return to its normal course for another year.

Their return journey was swifter than their outward one, for the boots seemed eager to carry them home, and wherever drops of the glowing water fell, plants sprang up instantly from the parched earth, creating a trail of green life behind them through the formerly barren landscape. When they reached the first village of the woman's kingdom, they placed three drops of the backward-flowing water in the village well, and within hours clouds gathered for the first time in three years, releasing gentle rain that spread from village to town to city, following the path of their journey as if the sky itself were responding to the river water's call to flow in its proper way once more.

The king himself came to thank the woman once known as Lady Elara, offering her a place at court and any reward she might name, but she asked only for a small cottage with a garden where those in need might find her, saying, "I have been both young and beautiful, old and wise, and I find I prefer the latter – beauty fades like morning mist, but kindness waters the soul like gentle rain." And so it came to pass that the woman lived contentedly, sometimes growing younger when great kindnesses were needed, sometimes older as she rested between good deeds, while the prince – who visited often, bringing books and news and laughter – ensured that her story was told throughout both kingdoms: how an old woman and a cursed prince had found the river that flows backward, proving that time's current, like water and like life itself, sometimes requires us to move against its normal flow to find our truest path.
