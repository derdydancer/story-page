Adheres to archetypal settings and characters.", "Moral Implication": "Establishes a baseline of simple happiness and family love, which will be contrasted later.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Represents the initial state of wholeness or childhood innocence (daughter with loving mother) within a humble but contained world (cottage near the wood - border of consciousness/unconsciousness).

Remarriage often introduces conflict in these tales.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The positive Mother archetype disappears.

Keeps the focus on the daughter's plight and the stepmother's deceit. Simple explanation for his passivity.", "Moral Implication": "Parental neglect or blindness can enable abuse. The protagonist cannot rely on conventional authority figures for protection.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Father principle (woodcutter) remains weak, passive, or deceived (\"saw nothing,\" \"told him lies\") by the negative feminine (Stepmother).

Cruelty increases.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The negative feminine (Stepmother) imposes another task demanding discernment and order (\"sort these\") from chaos (mixed grains).

Her malice escalates to plotting removal (\"must send her where she will not return\"). Sets up the next phase of the story.", "Moral Implication": "Wickedness doesn't give up easily and escalates its efforts when frustrated. The conflict moves beyond household tasks.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Repeatedly thwarted in imposing chaos/tasks within the immediate environment (home/psyche), the negative feminine (Stepmother) plans to expel the Ego (daughter) into a dangerous external situation, hoping the outer world will destroy her.", "Sentence": "The stepmother returned, saw the neat piles, and was more vexed than before, thinking, \"I must send her where she will not return.\"", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 14}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces the specific dangerous errand: fetching water from a cursed well in the deep forest, known to be perilous.

The effect is immediate and slightly comical (Devil stuck). Direct and focuses on action over emotion.", "Moral Implication": "Calmness and resourcefulness in the face of annoyance/trickery. Magic overcomes petty evil.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The Ego (girl) uses her inner resource/ordering principle (handkerchief) not just for cleaning but for imposing order/stasis on the disruptive Shadow element (Devil).

This confirms who the obstacle was and removes him from the immediate path. Humour in his undignified situation.", "Grimm Style": "Antagonist reveals identity when thwarted (common trope). Expresses anger through simple reported action/speech (\"howled,\" \"cursed\"). Overcome simply by the magic item.

The danger of envy and malice, striking at moments of vulnerability or happiness.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The negative complexes (Stepmother/sister) attack the Ego (bride) at the moment of union, using hidden weapons (pins) during a gesture of false intimacy (embrace).

Order restored through elimination of evil.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The ruling conscious principle (King) decrees the definitive containment or dissolution (\"barrel rolled into river\") of the destructive negative complexes (Stepmother/sister) now that they are fully exposed.
