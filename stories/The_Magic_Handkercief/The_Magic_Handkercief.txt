The Magic Handkercief
There was once a poor woodcutter who lived with his wife and their daughter in a little cottage on the edge of a wood. But one day the wife fell ill, and soon she knew she must die. She called her daughter to her side and gave her a plain linen handkerchief, saying, "Keep this always, child; it can clean any mess, big or small." Then the mother died, and after a time the woodcutter grieved and took another wife to keep house. This new wife had a daughter of her own, and she hated the woodcutter's daughter from the first day, gave her only rags to wear, and made her work hard from morn till night. One morning the stepmother scattered soot, ashes, and feathers all over the cottage floor and said, "Clean this perfectly before nightfall, or you get no supper." The poor girl wept, but then she remembered her mother's handkerchief and took it from her pocket. She wiped it once across the dirty floor, and instantly the floor was clean and spotless, so that not a speck remained. When the stepmother saw the clean floor, she was astonished and hated her stepdaughter all the more for her cleverness, though she knew not how it was done. All this time the woodcutter her father saw nothing, for the stepmother told him lies about how lazy and clumsy his daughter was.
The next day, the stepmother poured a great sack of lentils, peas, and barley onto the hearth and said, "Sort these into three neat piles by sunset, or you will be turned out of the house." The girl thought this task impossible, but she took out the handkerchief her mother had given her. She waved it thrice over the jumbled grains, and they flew apart as if alive, landing in three neat piles on the floor. The stepmother returned, saw the neat piles, and was more vexed than before, thinking, "I must send her where she will not return." So she gave the girl a cracked pitcher and said, "Go deep into the wood to the well from which no one returns, and fetch me water by morning." The girl took the cracked pitcher, though she was afraid, put the handkerchief safely in her pocket, and went into the wood. As she walked, a little man with a goat's foot, hidden ill by his boot, stuck out his leg and tried to trip her, snarling, "Where do you hurry, clumsy child?" The girl touched his foot with the handkerchief, then wiped the path before her, and the little man found his foot stuck fast to the ground, unable to move it an inch. The little man howled and cursed, crying "Let me go, I am the Devil, I say!" but the girl went on her way, leaving him stuck fast. She came at last to a deep, dark well overgrown with thorns, and the air around it felt cold.
As she peered down, pale hands reached out from the darkness within, and tried to grasp her arms to pull her down into the water. But the girl held out the handkerchief, and the pale hands drew back as if burned by its touch. She could now lower the pitcher, but alas, it was cracked, and the water ran out as fast as she drew it up. Just then an old wanderer with kind eyes came by and saw her trouble, asking, "Why weep by such a dark well, daughter?" The girl told him of her cruel stepmother, the task, and the cracked pitcher that could hold no water. The wanderer smiled gently and said, "Line the pitcher with your handkerchief; perhaps it holds more than just cleanliness." The girl did as he told her, lining the cracked pitcher with the linen square, and behold, it held the water perfectly full to the brim. She turned to thank the kind old man, but the wanderer was gone, and she stood alone by the well once more. She carefully carried the full pitcher and made her way back through the wood, arriving home just as dawn was breaking. The stepmother saw her safe return with the water and was so angry her face turned purple; she nearly burst with rage that the girl had not perished.
Now the stepmother falsely accused the girl of stealing her silver locket, convinced the woodcutter it was true, and made him take his daughter far away to a barren heath and leave her there. The poor woodcutter did as he was told, drove his daughter in the cart for a whole day to where there was no tree or house, and left her there alone. The girl looked about; there was nothing to eat or drink, and nowhere to shelter from the wind that blew across the heath. She took out her handkerchief, spread it on the ground, and wished for food and drink, and at once a crust of bread, a piece of cheese, and a cup of clear water appeared upon it. After she had eaten, she wished again upon the handkerchief for shelter, and there stood before her a small hut made of woven branches. She lived there for some time in the little hut, and the handkerchief gave her all she needed each day. One day the king's son of that country was out hunting with his men and rode across the barren heath. He was surprised to see a hut in such a lonely place and rode up to look inside. There he found the girl sitting quietly, dressed in simple clothes woven by the handkerchief's magic. The king's son thought she had a good face and asked if she would come to the castle to serve as a laundress, for they needed one sorely.
The girl agreed readily, wiped her hut with the handkerchief until it folded small enough to fit in her pocket, and went with him to the royal castle. There she worked as laundress, and with her handkerchief, the castle's linens were suddenly whiter and cleaner than ever before, so that everyone marvelled. Now there was great trouble in that kingdom, for a strange creeping stain, like black mould, was spreading across the land, and no amount of scrubbing by man or beast could clean it. The king proclaimed that whoever could cleanse the land of this creeping stain should have his son's hand in marriage and half the kingdom besides. Many wise men and bold knights tried their hand, using strange potions and great force, but the stain only spread faster for their efforts. The little laundress heard of this, and thought of her handkerchief, and said quietly to the prince, "Let me try, perhaps I can clean this mess." The king's son, remembering the state of his shirts, agreed to let her try, though others at court scoffed that a laundress could succeed where knights had failed. So the girl went to the edge of the spreading stain where it touched the castle walls, and she knelt and touched the blackness with her linen handkerchief. At its touch, the stain vanished like mist in the morning sun; it shrank back from the handkerchief rapidly until the whole land was clean and green again. There was great amazement and rejoicing throughout the land, and all knew the little laundress had saved them.
The king himself came down, took her hand, and said, "You have saved our kingdom, brave girl, and as promised, you shall marry my son." The king's son was well pleased, for he liked the girl greatly, and soon preparations were begun for a grand wedding feast. But when the cruel stepmother and her daughter heard the news back at the cottage, they grew black with envy and plotted wickedness together. They journeyed to the castle, pretending great joy for the bride, but carrying sharp pins hidden in their cloaks. On the wedding morning, they asked to embrace the bride for luck, and as they held her, they stabbed her secretly with their sharp pins. The girl gave a soft cry and fell down upon the floor, and soon she lay still as if dead. Quickly, the stepmother put the wedding veil on her own ugly daughter and tried to hurry her to the altar to fool the prince. But the linen handkerchief flew out from the fallen girl's pocket, wiped her face, cleaned the pinpricks, and woke her at once, unharmed. The true bride stood up, pointed to the stepmother and her daughter, and cried, "Hold! That is a false bride; these two tried to kill me with pins!" The guards seized the wicked pair, and indeed the sharp pins were found hidden in their cloaks just as the girl had said.
The king declared their crime deserved death, so they were put into a barrel stuck full of nails inside and rolled into the river until they were drowned. Then the true bride married the king's son, and there was a great feast that lasted many days. Her father, the woodcutter, heard what had happened and lived alone in his cottage thereafter, and often wept for his foolishness. The new princess lived happily with her prince, and she often used the handkerchief simply to wipe away a tear or keep her collars neat. As for the little man with the goat's foot, some say he is still stuck fast by the path near the dark well in the wood. And though no one knew it then, the kind old wanderer who helped her at the well was God himself, walking the earth a while. The magic handkerchief, her mother's gift, had indeed saved her many times from harm and sorrow. It proved that even the worst messes, made by wickedness or misfortune, could be wiped clean away. And that is why, when faced with a terrible muddle or a dreadful spot of bother, people learned to take a deep breath. And that is why we always say, when starting a big clean-up, "Best wipe it clean down to the bone!"
