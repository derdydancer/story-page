The Beetle and the Weight of Wisdom
There was once a little beetle who dwelt under a large stone. This beetle thought himself exceedingly wise. He would watch the ants carry crumbs and say to himself: 'Ah, foolish creatures, toiling for such trifles.' One day, he decided: 'I shall go forth and teach the world true wisdom.' So he crawled out from under his stone and set off without so much as a crumb for his journey. Not far had he gone when he met a large, muddy pig wallowing in a puddle. The beetle puffed himself up and declared: 'Hark, O Swine! Cease your base wallowing and attend to words of great import!' The pig grunted, splashed more mud upon itself, and paid the beetle no heed. The beetle stamped a tiny foot and cried: 'Ignorant beast! You know not what you miss!' And so the beetle huffed away, still convinced of its great mission.
After some time travelling over rough ground, the beetle came upon two fat caterpillars munching on a green leaf. 'Ho there, lowly worms!' chirped the beetle. 'Cease your endless eating, and attend, for I bring enlightenment!' One caterpillar paused its chewing for a moment, waggled its head, then resumed eating; the other did not even look up. The beetle scurried back and forth before them, agitated, and cried: 'Fools! Do you not see the shadow of the bird that circles above, ready to devour such as you?' 'There are many leaves on this bush,' said the first caterpillar slowly, 'and no bird sings here today.' The beetle, seeing its ploy had failed, kicked a tiny pebble at the leaf and muttered: 'May you both be eaten before nightfall, then!' Then it scuttled away into the undergrowth, muttering about the sheer stubbornness of the ignorant. The sun grew hot, and the path became dusty and steep; the little beetle began to tire, for it had eaten nothing. Presently, it spied a small, grey pebble resting quite still on the path and thought: 'Aha, this one looks different; perhaps a most contemplative soul!' It hurried towards it, cleared its throat, and began: 'O, wise Stone, you who sit in silent contemplation! You, at least, shall comprehend the mysteries I unfold!'
The pebble, of course, said nothing, for it was but a pebble. But the beetle nodded sagely to itself and thought: 'Such deep listening I have never encountered! This is a true scholar, struck dumb by the weight of my truths!' Feeling greatly encouraged, it declared aloud: 'I shall gather an army of such wise pebbles, and together we shall reform the world with our silent understanding!' And so it began to scour the dusty path, peering at every stone, searching for pebbles that seemed particularly still and thoughtful. Soon it found another, and another, and to each it would announce: 'Ah, another sage! You shall join my grand legion of wisdom!' It tried to nudge the pebbles forward with its head, but they were heavy, and its progress was exceedingly slow. Now, an old, one-eyed raven, perched on a withered branch nearby, had been watching the beetle’s peculiar toil for some time. At last, the raven cawed loudly and croaked down: 'Caw! And what great work is this, little one, that consumes all your might?' The beetle, startled, looked up and replied with dignity: 'This, Sir Raven, is no mere toil! It is the assemblage of the wisest minds in the land, an army of silent philosophers I am gathering for the salvation of this witless world!' The raven blinked its one eye, then swooped down, deftly plucked up one of the beetle's chosen pebbles, swallowed it with a gulp, and cawed: 'One philosopher less for your army, I see! This one, at least, seems more easily digested than its wisdom might have been.'
The beetle stood frozen for a moment, its antennae twitching, then it shrieked: 'You... you barbarian! You have devoured a sage of untold profundity!' The raven merely ruffled its feathers and said: 'One creature's profundity, little friend, is sometimes another's indigestion. That one tasted mostly of grit.' The beetle's tiny shoulders slumped. 'Perhaps,' it mumbled, 'perhaps the world is not yet ready for such an assembly of wisdom.' 'If you wish to move stones, little teacher,' the raven croaked, already taking to the air, 'try pushing them downhill. It requires less philosophy.' With a final caw, it was gone. The beetle’s antennae perked up. 'Downhill!' it exclaimed. 'Of course! The raven is wiser than it appears! Gravity shall be my ally!' It found a small incline and began to nudge a chosen pebble towards the edge, thinking to start a controlled descent. The pebble, however, shot downwards with surprising speed and vanished into a dark crack in the earth. 'Well now,' the beetle said, blinking in dismay, 'that one was perhaps too eager for enlightenment.' It tried with another pebble, nudging it even more gently, but it too tumbled swiftly out of sight. After losing a dozen more 'sages' in this fashion, the beetle sat down with a sigh that stirred the dust around it. Just then, a sudden gust of wind kicked up a cloud of dust and blew something small and papery right against the beetle's face.
The beetle brushed the thing from its face and saw it was a torn piece of brightly coloured paper, perhaps from a sweet wrapper discarded by a child. 'Aha!' it buzzed, its earlier despair forgotten. 'A missive! A proclamation from an unknown kingdom, no doubt, filled with cryptic wisdom!' It turned the paper this way and that with its forelegs, peering at the faded colours and tracing the printed swirls with one antenna as if to decipher a cryptic message. Just then, a hungry-looking slug oozed slowly towards it and asked in a gurgly voice: 'Is that… food residue upon that curious parchment?' 'Food residue? Insolent gastropod!' scoffed the beetle. 'This is clearly a sacred text, a map to untold enlightenment, or perhaps a royal decree of immense power!' The slug, unimpressed by titles, merely extended its eye-stalks towards the paper and began to rasp at a corner of it with its rough tongue. 'Desist, vile defiler!' the beetle buzzed, trying to push the slug away with its legs. 'You are consuming ancient truths, you uncultured mollusc!' The slug paused, seemed to consider, then gurgled: 'Tastes faintly of old sugar and disappointment. No great power here, only faint sweetness long gone.' The beetle reeled back as if struck by lightning, speechless for a full minute as the slug calmly finished consuming the corner of the paper. Then its antennae began to quiver with a new idea. 'Of course!' it whispered. 'This slug is no mere eater of refuse! It is a cunning guardian of the true path, and this paper was but a test of my discernment!'
'O, wise and subtle Slug, patient tester of aspirants!' the beetle cried, bowing low. 'Forgive my earlier blindness! I perceive your true nature now! Show me the way to the real enlightenment!' The slug, having found the paper mostly unappetizing, merely gurgled again and continued its slow crawl, leaving a glistening slime trail behind it on a flat stone. 'Aha!' the beetle shivered with excitement. 'The Silver Path! The illuminated way, shown only to the worthy! It leaves a sign for me to follow!' And so the beetle dutifully set off, carefully following the glistening slime trail, convinced it was a secret map left by the Slug-Sage. The trail led over rough bark and mossy stones, and then downwards, towards a dark and damp hole under a rotten log. 'Aha!' thought the beetle, 'The sanctuary of the Slug-Sage must be hidden from common sight! Only the truly dedicated may enter!' And so, it plunged bravely into the darkness. Inside, after its eyes adjusted, it found the slug it had followed, now resting amongst a whole congregation of its brethren, all placidly consuming a patch of pale fungus. 'Greetings, O illuminated council of Sages!' the beetle announced, its voice echoing slightly in the damp space. 'I have followed the Silver Path shown by your esteemed member and have arrived to learn your deepest secrets!' A few eye-stalks twitched in its direction; one or two slugs paused their munching momentarily, but most continued to eat the fungus with quiet concentration. The slug it had followed, after a long moment, slowly turned an eye-stalk and gurgled: 'The fungus is good today. Very damp.'
'Aha!' the beetle whispered to itself, its antennae quivering. 'A riddle! A metaphor! “The fungus is good” means spiritual sustenance is plentiful here! “Very damp” must signify the profound depth of their understanding!' It decided then that to understand their wisdom, it too must partake of this sacred fungus, and so it timidly approached a patch and took a tiny nibble. The world tilted. Colours shrieked. The beetle's own legs felt like melting wax, and the gurgling of the slugs sounded like the roaring of dragons. The slugs around it seemed to swell into giant, glistening monsters, their eye-stalks waving like menacing tentacles, their rasping mouths vast, hungry caverns. With a squeak of pure terror, the beetle scrambled backwards, its many legs tangling in their haste to escape the perceived horrors. One of the larger slugs, pausing from its meal of fungus, remarked to its neighbour in a slow rumble: 'This one has a lively spirit, for a dry morsel.' Most others simply continued to eat. 'A dry morsel!' shrieked the beetle in its mind, for its voice was stuck in its throat. 'They mean to eat me too, just like the raven ate the philosopher-pebble!' This final horror lent it strength, and it burst from the hole like a popped seed, tumbling head over heels into the daylight, which now seemed unbearably bright and loud. It did not stop running, for every rustle of a leaf now sounded like the rasp of a giant slug, and every shadow seemed to hide a waving eye-stalk. It blundered past the very stone under which it had first dwelt, but in its terror, the stone seemed just another menacing lump in a hostile world, offering no comfort.
At long last, when it could run no more, it stumbled into a patch of tall, sharp-edged grass and collapsed, its tiny heart hammering against its shell. As it lay there panting, a shadow fell over it, and it heard a slow, deliberate rustling. A very old, slow-moving tortoise was ambling through the grass on its morning constitutional. The tortoise stopped its slow munching of a dandelion, peered down with ancient eyes, and rumbled: 'Well now, little strider, you seem in a great hurry to be nowhere. What brings you to such a breathless state in my breakfast patch?' The beetle, still trembling, gasped out: 'Monsters! Horrible, glistening monsters with waving tentacles and mouths like caves! They live in a dark hole and eat fungus, and... and they tried to eat me!' The tortoise blinked slowly, then resumed its munching on the dandelion for a moment, chewed thoughtfully, and swallowed. 'Ah,' it rumbled at last. 'Sounds like you met my cousins, the slugs, down by the old log. They are rather fond of damp spots and mushrooms. A bit slimy perhaps, but not generally given to philosophical debate, nor, to my knowledge, beetle-eating.' 'S-slugs?' stammered the beetle. 'But... the tentacles... the giant maws... the roaring?' The tortoise munched another bite of dandelion. 'Ah, the little spotted fungi with the purple tops? Yes, some of those, if eaten, can give small creatures rather vivid dreams, or waking nightmares, as it were. Makes the world seem quite different for a time.' The beetle was silent for a long time, its antennae drooped. Its legs, which had been braced for flight, untangled slowly. Then, in a very small voice, it asked: 'So... the colours did not truly shriek? And the fungus... was just fungus?'
The tortoise nodded its ancient head. 'Just fungus, little one. And colours, I find, rarely make much noise at all, unless one has been eating the spotted kind with the purple tops.' The beetle sat for a very long time under the tortoise’s patient gaze, saying nothing. The sun climbed higher in the sky, and the sharp-edged grass cast shorter shadows. At last, it looked up at the tortoise and said, its voice barely a whisper: 'I... I believed I was exceedingly wise, and that I was teaching the world. But I think, perhaps, the world has been trying to teach me, and I was a very poor student.' The tortoise gave a slow, deliberate nod. 'The world is a patient teacher, little one, with many strange lessons, for those who finally learn to listen. And listening often begins when shouting stops.' The beetle looked at its own dusty legs. 'I think,' it said, 'I will go back to my stone. It is not far. And this time, I believe I will watch the ants with new eyes, and perhaps ask them about crumbs.' And so, the beetle turned and began the slow journey back the way it had come, making no grand pronouncements, nor looking for sages in pebbles. The old tortoise watched it go until it was but a tiny speck in the grass, then, with another slow blink, it returned to its breakfast dandelion. When the beetle, after much toil, finally reached its old stone, the stone looked just the same as it always had; yet to the beetle, it seemed entirely different. It crawled under it, not as a king returning to his castle, but as a student entering a quiet school, and it settled down to watch, and to listen. And sometimes, if you looked very closely, you might see it nodding thoughtfully at the busy ants, as if learning a great secret at last; and it said nothing at all.
Meanwhile, the ants, who had never ceased their labours during all the beetle’s adventures, marched on in their endless lines, carrying crumbs and seeds. One old ant, with a slightly bent antenna from a past skirmish with a centipede, paused for a moment near the beetle’s stone and remarked to a younger companion. 'That noisy beetle under the stone,' it said, its voice a dry rustle, 'has been remarkably quiet these past few days. He used to shout such nonsense about wisdom and pebbles.' The younger ant, struggling with a large seed, replied without stopping: 'Perhaps he finally found a crumb big enough to keep his mouth full. Or perhaps the sun has addled his wits.' The old ant twitched its bent antenna. 'Perhaps,' it mused. 'Or perhaps, after all his journeys, he is simply tired of the sound of his own voice. Some lessons are learned in silence.' And with that, the two ants continued on their way, for the day was getting on, and the colony always needed more provisions before nightfall. The beetle remained still and quiet under its stone, watching the endless parade of legs and antennae, and the world bustled on around it. A large crumb of what looked like dried honey-cake, dropped by a passing ant, landed near the beetle’s leg. The beetle looked at it for a long moment, then carefully, with one leg, nudged it a little closer to the ants’ bustling trail. And under its stone, the beetle, who once thought itself exceedingly wise, now knew the profound wisdom of a single, well-placed crumb, and was content.
