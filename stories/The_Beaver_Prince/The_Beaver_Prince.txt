The Beaver Prince
Once upon a time, in a deep forest beside a clear blue river, there lived a beaver with the longest, whitest teeth that any creature had ever seen. This beaver was known throughout the forest for building the finest dams, which never leaked and withstood even the fiercest spring floods. The king of the land, who had a magnificent castle on the hill overlooking the forest, often came to marvel at the beaver's handiwork and would nod his royal head in approval. So impressed was the king that he appointed the beaver as Royal Dam Inspector, and even assigned a royal tooth-polisher to keep the beaver's magnificent white teeth gleaming. One bright morning, as the beaver was inspecting a small dam near the edge of the forest, a breathless messenger arrived with an urgent summons from the king. "The king requires your presence at once," gasped the messenger, "for he has a task of great importance that only a beaver with teeth as strong and white as yours can accomplish." Without hesitation, the beaver slapped his tail upon the water, bid farewell to his fellow forest creatures, and followed the messenger up the winding path to the castle. The path was steep and the day grew hot, but the beaver, though unused to being so far from his river, continued onward with determination. At last they reached the castle gates, which swung open to reveal a courtyard filled with anxious nobles and servants rushing about in great distress. The beaver was led directly to the throne room, where the king sat with his head in his hands, for he had just received word that his only daughter, the princess, was in terrible danger aboard a coach that was carrying a deadly secret in its cargo.
"My dear beaver," said the king, rising from his throne with a troubled expression, "my daughter has been sent as an escort for an important witness who holds secrets that could bring down a band of dangerous robbers, but I have received word that these villains have hidden a crate of venomous serpents aboard the coach." "These are no ordinary serpents," the king continued, wringing his hands, "for they have been treated with a special potion that will make them awaken and become most aggressive when the coach reaches the mountain pass at noon tomorrow." "I have called for you because your teeth, which are stronger than any sword and whiter than the purest snow, are said to be the only thing that can cut through the enchanted box containing these serpents and then defeat them before they harm my daughter and the others." The beaver, though small compared to the knights and soldiers who stood nearby, stepped forward and bowed his head to the king, signaling his acceptance of this dangerous mission. "You shall not go alone," declared the king, and he summoned his bravest captain, a wise old scholar who knew much about serpents, a stout woman who feared nothing, and a nimble-fingered tailor who could mend any tear. The royal stables provided the swiftest horses in the kingdom, provisions were packed, maps were consulted, and as the sun began to set, the beaver and his companions set out on the road that the coach had taken the previous day. They rode through the night, with only the stars and a sliver of moon to light their way, for they knew that every moment was precious if they were to reach the coach before it entered the mountain pass. When they reached a fork in the road and the captain was uncertain which path to take, the beaver sniffed the air, felt the direction of the wind, and confidently pointed with his nose to the right-hand path. Just as dawn was breaking, they came upon a massive tree that had fallen across the road, too large for the horses to jump and too heavy for the humans to move. While the others stood perplexed, the beaver immediately set to work, his white teeth flashing in the early morning light as he gnawed strategically at certain points of the trunk, causing it to break apart in exactly the right places to clear a path just wide enough for their horses to pass through.
As the sun climbed higher in the sky, the beaver and his companions pushed their horses harder, galloping across meadows and through shallow streams, always following the main road that led to the mountain pass. The captain pointed to fresh wheel ruts in the muddy road, declaring that they must belong to the royal coach, which gave them hope even as the morning hours slipped away. It was the stout woman, whose eyes were sharpest, who first spotted the coach in the distance, a small dark shape moving slowly up the winding road that led to the mountain pass. The sun was now directly overhead, which meant that noon had arrived and the serpents would soon awaken, so the captain urged their tired horses to a final desperate gallop. They raced alongside the coach, shouting and waving their arms, causing the old coachman to pull back on the reins in surprise and bring the four-horse team to a halt. The coach door opened and a young woman with a golden circlet on her brow—clearly the princess—leaned out and asked, "Captain, what is the meaning of this interruption to our journey?" "Your Highness, there is no time to explain fully," the captain replied breathlessly, "but there are venomous serpents hidden in the cargo of this coach, and they are set to awaken at any moment!" A stern-faced guard standing beside the coach scoffed, "Nonsense, we inspected all cargo thoroughly before departure, and there were no serpents." But even as he spoke these words, a soft, sinister hissing sound began to emanate from beneath the coach, and the horses stamped nervously, sensing danger. Without waiting for further discussion, the beaver leapt from his horse and dove beneath the coach, his white teeth gleaming as he prepared to confront whatever evil lurked in the shadows.
Under the coach, strapped to its underside with thick leather bindings, the beaver found a large wooden box that was vibrating slightly and emanating both the sinister hissing sound and a strange, sweet smell. The beaver's powerful white teeth made quick work of the leather straps, and he carefully lowered the box to the ground, then dragged it out from under the coach where the others could see it. The old scholar knelt beside the box, examining the strange symbols carved into its lid, and declared with alarm, "These are the marks of the Shadow Guild of Robbers, and the sweet smell is the chemical trigger that is awakening the serpents within!" The captain immediately ordered everyone away from the coach, helping the princess, a nervous-looking man who must be the witness, and the other passengers to move to a safe distance while the beaver and the scholar remained with the box. "I must open the box and deal with the serpents before they escape on their own," the beaver communicated to the scholar through gestures and determined looks, which the wise old man somehow understood perfectly. "The serpents will be most vulnerable at the moment the box is opened, before they can fully awaken," explained the scholar, "and your white teeth, which contain a rare magic, are indeed their greatest weakness, just as the king believed." The beaver positioned himself carefully, took a deep breath, and then with one powerful bite, broke the lock on the wooden box, immediately jumping back as the lid slowly began to creak open. From within the box, three serpents with scales that shimmered like oil on water began to rise, their forked tongues flicking out to taste the air, their eyes like tiny rubies fixed on the beaver who had disturbed their awakening. Though his small heart pounded with fear, the beaver stood his ground, baring his magnificent white teeth which now began to glow with a strange light that caused the serpents to hesitate in their advance. With a sudden movement that surprised even the scholar, the beaver lunged forward, his teeth clamping down on the first serpent just behind its triangular head, the magical glow from his teeth seeming to paralyze the creature instantly.
The serpent writhed for only a moment before turning to dust, as if the magic in the beaver's white teeth had purified it out of existence. The other two serpents, seeing their companion destroyed, hissed with rage and lunged simultaneously at the beaver, one aiming for his throat and the other for his tail. The scholar, proving himself braver than his aged appearance suggested, swung his heavy walking stick and struck the serpent aiming for the beaver's tail, knocking it aside just long enough for the beaver to deal with the more immediate threat. With a quick dodge to the left, the beaver avoided the second serpent's strike and then, in a flash of white teeth, bit down on this serpent as well, turning it instantly to the same fine dust as the first. The third serpent, seeing that it could not defeat the beaver, suddenly slithered away with surprising speed, heading directly toward the group of passengers who were watching from what they had thought was a safe distance. The beaver bounded after the serpent, his short legs moving with unexpected quickness, but the serpent had already reached the group and was rearing up before the terrified witness, whose testimony was so crucial to the kingdom. Just as the serpent prepared to strike, the nimble-fingered tailor threw himself forward, using his thick leather apron as a shield, catching the serpent's fangs in the tough material. This brave action gave the beaver the moment he needed to catch up and, with one final lunge, sink his glowing white teeth into the serpent's tail, causing the creature to stiffen and then crumble to dust from tail to head. "You have saved my life, brave beaver," said the witness, kneeling down to address the small hero, "and now I shall be able to give my testimony and bring the Shadow Guild of Robbers to justice." But their relief was short-lived, for the captain, who had been examining the coach, announced with a grim face, "The serpents have damaged the axle with their venom, and we cannot continue our journey in this coach."
"We are still half a day's ride from the nearest town," said the captain, looking at the sun's position, "and the witness must reach the Northern City by tomorrow if his testimony is to be heard by the High Court." The princess wrung her hands, the witness looked pale with worry, and even the stout woman who feared nothing bit her lip in concern, for they were stranded in a place where the Shadow Guild might find them again. The beaver, however, was not one to despair, and he began to examine their surroundings carefully, his bright eyes moving from the damaged coach to the nearby stream that flowed down from the mountains toward the Northern City. After a few moments, the beaver began to make excited gestures, pointing with his paw from the coach to the stream and then mimicking a chopping motion with his teeth, which the scholar observed carefully before his eyes widened in understanding. "I believe," said the scholar with growing excitement, "that our clever friend is suggesting we build a raft from the coach's wood and the surrounding trees, and then use the stream to carry us swiftly to the Northern City!" "A raft?" the captain exclaimed doubtfully, but then, looking at the swift-flowing stream and considering their limited options, he nodded and said, "It could work, and the stream does indeed flow north toward the city." With no time to waste, they set to work: the beaver gnawed through the wooden parts of the coach, the tailor used his tools to remove usable pieces, the stout woman and the captain carried the wood to the stream bank, and the scholar directed the overall construction based on the beaver's guidance. The beaver proved himself a master builder, showing them how to lash the logs together with leather straps from the coach's harness, how to create a raised platform in the center to keep the passengers dry, and how to fashion a steering oar from a long, straight branch. By late afternoon, the raft was complete, their meager belongings and provisions were loaded, and the nervous passengers were helped aboard, with the witness kept safely in the center where he could hold onto the makeshift railing. With the beaver positioned at the front to watch for obstacles, and the captain handling the steering oar at the back, they pushed off from the bank and were immediately caught by the current, which carried them swiftly northward as the sun began to sink toward the western mountains.
The stream carried them swiftly through the gathering dusk, between steep banks lined with dark trees whose branches sometimes reached out over the water like grasping fingers. Whenever dangerous rocks or fallen trees appeared in their path, the beaver would slap his tail on the water as a warning, giving the captain time to steer the raft safely around the obstacle. As they floated through a calm stretch of water, the witness explained to the princess and the others, "The Shadow Guild has eyes and ears everywhere, which is why I had to be moved in secret, for I was once their treasurer and know the location of all their hidden gold." "I am ashamed to say that I once helped them count their ill-gotten gains," the witness continued, his voice heavy with regret, "but when they murdered a poor widow for the single gold coin she had hidden in her shoe, I could bear it no longer and fled with their ledger of crimes." The others listened in silence, not condemning the man for his past but respecting his courage in standing against his former associates, while the beaver moved closer to the witness as if offering his protection. Their quiet conversation was interrupted when the stout woman, who was keeping watch, pointed to the ridge above the stream where several dark figures on horseback could be seen silhouetted against the evening sky. "It's the Shadow Guild!" the captain whispered urgently, "They must have found the coach and followed the stream, knowing it was our only path forward!" Quickly, the tailor and the stout woman covered the witness and the princess with a piece of canvas salvaged from the coach, while the captain steered the raft closer to the shadow of the bank to avoid being spotted in the fading light. For a tense moment, they drifted in silence, hardly daring to breathe, but then the moon emerged from behind a cloud, casting a silver path across the water that illuminated their raft clearly to anyone watching from above. The beaver, seeing their peril, suddenly dove into the water with a loud splash and began to create a great commotion downstream, slapping his tail repeatedly on the surface and drawing the attention of the riders, who spurred their horses in pursuit of what they thought was the raft trying to escape in the darkness.
The riders galloped along the ridge, following the sounds of the beaver's tail-slapping which echoed in the darkness, while the raft drifted silently around a bend in the stream and out of sight. "But what of our brave beaver?" whispered the princess with concern, "Will he not be captured or harmed by those wicked men?" The scholar smiled gently and replied, "Fear not, Your Highness, for the beaver is in his natural element in the water, and can swim and dive better than any man or horse could ever hope to follow." As they continued downstream in the darkness, the witness suddenly clutched at a small wooden object hanging from a cord around his neck and said in a trembling voice, "There is something I have not told you—the beaver is no ordinary beaver, but an enchanted prince from a neighboring kingdom!" "Three years ago, he refused to marry the daughter of a powerful enchantress," the witness continued, his voice low, "and she transformed him into a beaver, declaring that only by using his teeth to save a royal life would he be restored to human form." "I know this because before I joined the Shadow Guild, I was a servant in that enchantress's household and overheard the curse being placed," the witness explained, "and I recognized the prince-turned-beaver immediately by the unusual whiteness of his teeth, which retained their human magic even in animal form." The others on the raft stared at the witness in astonishment, suddenly understanding the beaver's unusual intelligence and noble bearing, while the princess clasped her hands together as the truth of their companion's identity became clear to her. "Then we must ensure he returns safely," declared the captain firmly, "for not only has he saved us from the serpents and the Shadow Guild, but he deserves to regain his true form after such noble service." As if summoned by their conversation, there came a soft splashing sound, and the beaver pulled himself aboard the raft, his fur sleek and wet in the moonlight, looking exhausted but satisfied with his successful diversion. The princess, with tears in her eyes, reached out and gently stroked the beaver's wet head, whispering, "Brave prince, we know your secret now, and we shall help you break your curse and return to your true form."
The beaver froze at the princess's words, his bright eyes widening in surprise, for he had lived so long in his animal form that he had almost forgotten what it was like to be recognized as a prince. Through the night they continued their journey, with the captain and the stout woman taking turns at the steering oar, while the beaver, despite his exhaustion, remained vigilant at the front of the raft, watching for dangers in the moonlit water. As dawn broke across the eastern sky, the scholar, who had been consulting his maps by the growing light, pointed ahead with excitement and announced, "Look there, the spires of the Northern City are visible on the horizon!" Their joy was short-lived, however, for the sound of rushing water grew louder ahead, and the beaver's frantic tail-slapping warned them that a small waterfall lay between them and the city docks, too steep for the raft to navigate safely. "We've come so far," said the tailor with dismay, looking at the white water ahead, "only to be stopped within sight of our destination." The beaver, however, was studying the waterfall intently, his eyes moving from the rushing water to the sturdy construction of their raft, and then to a series of protruding rocks that formed a kind of broken staircase down the side of the falls. "I believe," said the scholar, observing the beaver's gestures, "that he thinks we can guide the raft to those stepping stones and then control our descent by using the steering oar to push off from each rock in succession!" With no better option available, the captain took the steering oar, the stout woman and the tailor positioned themselves with long poles on either side of the raft, and together they guided their craft toward the first of the protruding rocks, where the beaver leapt off to help direct their descent. The descent was terrifying, with the raft tipping and water splashing over its sides as they bumped from rock to rock, but the beaver, leaping nimbly between the stones, guided them with gestures and tail-slaps, while the humans used their poles and oar to keep the raft from capsizing. With a final bump and splash, they cleared the last rock and entered the calm water below the falls, where the beaver swam back to the raft and was helped aboard by the princess herself, her eyes shining with admiration for the clever prince trapped in a beaver's body.
By mid-morning, their unusual craft reached the busy docks of the Northern City, causing no small stir among the merchants and sailors who had never before seen a raft made from coach parts arrive with such a strange company of travelers. The harbor master, a portly man with a chain of office around his neck, hurried down to meet them, his face a mixture of curiosity and suspicion until the princess revealed her royal circlet and explained their urgent mission. With proper respect now being shown, the harbor master himself led them through the city streets to the High Court, where the witness clutched his precious ledger of the Shadow Guild's crimes and the beaver walked proudly beside the princess, his white teeth gleaming in the sunlight. Before the assembled judges of the High Court, the witness told his tale and presented his evidence, while the captain and the princess recounted the attack of the serpents and the pursuit by the Shadow Guild, with the judges listening in growing outrage at such villainy. "And this beaver," asked the Chief Judge, leaning forward with interest, "you say he destroyed the serpents with his teeth and led you safely to our city?" When the princess confirmed this, the judge declared, "Then he has performed a great service to the kingdom, and must be rewarded accordingly!" "Your Honor," said the witness, stepping forward, "this is no ordinary beaver, but an enchanted prince who can only return to his true form if his deed of saving royal lives is formally acknowledged by those he has saved, in the presence of witnesses and with proper gratitude." Understanding what must be done, the princess knelt before the beaver in the middle of the High Court and declared in a clear voice, "I, Princess of the Southern Kingdom, do formally acknowledge that this brave beaver, with his magnificent white teeth, has saved my life and the lives of all who traveled with me, and I offer my deepest and most sincere gratitude for his courage and cleverness." As the last word left her lips, a strange golden light surrounded the beaver, growing so bright that all had to shield their eyes, and when they looked again, where the beaver had stood there now stood a handsome young man dressed in royal garments, with a crown upon his head and teeth as white as the purest snow. "I am Prince Aldric of the Eastern Forests," he said in a voice rusty from three years of disuse, "and I thank you all for helping me break the enchantress's curse and for accepting my help when I could not explain who I truly was." There was great celebration throughout the Northern City that day, for the Shadow Guild of Robbers was brought to justice, the witness was pardoned for his past and given a small cottage by the sea, the captain was promoted, the tailor and the stout woman were richly rewarded, the scholar was given access to the royal library, and as for Princess and Prince Aldric, whose teeth remained unusually white and strong even in human form, they were married the following spring, uniting their kingdoms and living happily ever after.
