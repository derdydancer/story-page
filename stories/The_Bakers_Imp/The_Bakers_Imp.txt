The Baker's Imp
There lived a baker who was known for his honesty, but also for his temper.
One morning, he found his bread had not risen properly overnight. ‘Mischief!’ he muttered, blaming the yeast.
But the next night, though he used fresh yeast, the same thing happened.
On the third night, he resolved to watch.
He hid himself behind some flour sacks, and near midnight, he saw a tiny creature, no bigger than his thumb, with pointed ears and clothes like brown leaves, creep into the bakery. It skipped over to his dough trough and giggled, then pinched off a piece of dough and popped it into its mouth. After that, it danced three times around the trough, whispering strange words, and vanished up the chimney. In the morning, the bread was again flat and heavy.
‘Aha!’ thought the baker. ‘So that is the rogue!’
The next night, he left a small bowl of warm milk and a crumb of honey cake near the trough. When the imp appeared, it saw the offering, sniffed suspiciously, but then drank the milk and ate the cake greedily. ‘Hmm,’ it chirped, ‘better fare than dough.’ It danced only once around the trough, and vanished.
The next morning, the bread had risen, though not as high as usual.
The following night, the baker left milk and honey cake again, and added a tiny silver coin. The imp ate, drank, saw the coin, and snatched it up with delight. It bowed quickly towards the sacks where the baker hid, did not dance at all, and vanished. The next morning, the bread rose perfectly, light and golden.
The baker thought, ‘I have pleased the creature.’ So, every night he left milk, cake, and a small coin. His bread became famous throughout the town for its lightness and flavour, and he prospered greatly.
But the baker grew greedy. ‘Why should I pay this imp every night?’ he thought. ‘He does nothing but dance and whisper.’
So one night, he left out only the milk and cake, but no coin.
The imp came, ate and drank, but then looked about for the coin. Seeing none, its face grew stormy. It kicked over the milk bowl, stamped on the cake crumbs, and then jumped into the dough trough, stirring the dough wildly with its dirty feet while shrieking tiny curses.
Then it vanished up the chimney.
The next morning, the bread was not only flat but tasted of soot and spite.
The baker was furious. That night, he waited with a heavy wooden peel.
When the imp came, before it could reach the trough, the baker leapt out. ‘You villain!’ he roared, swinging the peel. The imp dodged, nimble as a flea, and spat at him. ‘You broke the bargain!’ it shrieked.
‘Now your bread will always show your temper!’ And it vanished.
From that day on, no matter how carefully the baker worked, his bread was often sour, or heavy, or burnt. His fame faded, his temper worsened, and people said his bread tasted of anger. He never prospered as he had before, and never again saw the little baker’s imp.
