var analysisData = [{"Plot Function": "Introduces the protagonist (Karl), his profession (farmer), and his defining characteristic/flaw (terrible temper), which sets the stage for the story's central conflict.", "Grimm Style": "The opening 'There once lived a...' is a classic fairy tale formula, aligning with Grimm style. Naming is simple ('Karl'). 'Terrible temper' is a functional, direct description of a core trait. Vocabulary is simple and direct. Sentence structure is a simple compound sentence. The tone is declarative and matter-of-fact. Adheres well to the Grimm style for an opening.", "Moral Implication": "This sentence immediately establishes anger as a significant and negative trait, hinting that such a temper will lead to problems, introducing the central moral theme of controlling one's anger.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Karl's 'terrible temper' can be seen as an uncontrolled aspect of the Id or the Shadow. The farmer, typically connected to nurturing and growth, is ironically defined by a destructive internal force, suggesting an inner imbalance.", "Sentence": "There once lived a farmer named Karl who had a terrible temper.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 1}, {"Plot Function": "Elaborates on Karl's temper by describing its manifestations and the environment that often provokes it, reinforcing his flaw and the difficulty of his life.", "Grimm Style": "The description of actions ('bellow and roar, kick stones, break his own tools') is concrete and action-oriented. 'Stony farm' is a simple, functional description. 'Fury' is a direct emotional term. The phrase 'which they often did' is a slightly more complex clausal insertion than typical Grimm simplicity but acceptable. Sentence is compound-complex but reads fairly directly. Vocabulary remains simple. Tone is declarative, reporting Karl's common behavior.", "Moral Implication": "Illustrates the destructive and unproductive nature of Karl's anger, showing how it harms his property and likely his well-being. It emphasizes the lack of control and the cyclical nature of his frustration.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'stony farm' can symbolize a life full of hardship or internal obstacles that fuel his anger. Breaking his 'own tools' signifies self-sabotage, where his anger turns inward or destroys the means of his own productivity and sustenance. His actions are primal expressions of frustration.", "Sentence": "When things went wrong, which they often did on his stony farm, he would bellow and roar, kick stones, and sometimes even break his own tools in fury.", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 2}, {"Plot Function": "Introduces a secondary character (Marta, his wife), contrasts her personality with Karl's (patient), and provides foreshadowing through her dialogue about the consequences of his anger.", "Grimm Style": "'Patient soul' is a simple, archetypal description. Marta's dialogue is direct and serves as a clear warning, a common feature in cautionary tales. 'Oh, Karl' is a gentle, folk-tale-like address. The foreshadowing is explicit, which fits the didactic nature of some Grimm tales. The sentence structure is compound. 'Sighed' is a simple descriptor of her weariness.", "Moral Implication": "Marta's patience highlights Karl's impatience. Her warning, 'your anger will carry you off one day!', directly states the story's central moral lesson: uncontrolled anger can lead to one's undoing or a significant negative transformation. It underscores the idea that actions (or uncontrolled emotions) have consequences.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Marta represents the voice of reason, patience, or perhaps the Anima figure trying to guide the Ego (Karl). Her sigh suggests the burden of living with such uncontrolled emotion. The phrase 'carry you off' metaphorically implies a loss of self or being overwhelmed by one's passion, a journey to an undesirable state.", "Sentence": "His wife, Marta, was a patient soul, but she often sighed, \"Oh, Karl, your anger will carry you off one day!\"", "Chapter Number": 1, "Sentence Number": 3}, {"Plot Function": "Sets the scene for the inciting incident, showing Karl engaged in a typical farm task that is prone to frustration.", "Grimm Style": "Simple description of action and setting. 'One afternoon' is a typical time marker. 'Broken fence post' and 'prize pig' are concrete nouns. Sentence structure is straightforward (simple sentence with participial phrase). The language is simple and direct.", "Moral Implication": "Shows an ordinary moment where Karl's temper might be tested, highlighting the everyday nature of the triggers for his flaw.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Fixing a 'broken fence post' can symbolize attempts to maintain order or control in his life, while the 'prize pig,' an animal, represents a less predictable, instinctual element that can disrupt such efforts.", "Sentence": "One afternoon, Karl was trying to fix a broken fence post while his prize pig rooted nearby.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 4}, {"Plot Function": "Provides the direct trigger for Karl's outburst \u2013 the pig's careless action leading to a minor accident.", "Grimm Style": "Action is described simply and clearly ('knocked over Karl\u2019s pot of nails'). 'Paying no heed' is a slightly more literary phrase but understandable. Vocabulary is simple. Sentence structure is simple.", "Moral Implication": "Illustrates how minor annoyances can escalate with a pre-existing bad temper. The pig's innocence ('paying no heed') contrasts with Karl's impending overreaction.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The pig, acting on instinct, disrupts Karl's work. This symbolizes how uncontrollable external factors or even perceived slights (the pig is oblivious) can trigger an internal explosion in someone prone to anger. The nails are tools for construction, now scattered and useless, mirroring the scattering of composure.", "Sentence": "The pig, paying no heed, knocked over Karl\u2019s pot of nails.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 5}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the immediate consequence of the pig's action, creating a minor inconvenience that will fuel Karl's anger.", "Grimm Style": "Simple, direct statement of fact. 'Scattered into the long grass' uses concrete imagery. Sentence structure is simple. Adheres well.", "Moral Implication": "The lost nails represent a small loss and frustration, a test of patience that Karl is set up to fail.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The nails scattering in 'long grass' symbolize difficulty, things becoming hidden or hard to retrieve, much like composure or rationality when lost to anger.", "Sentence": "They scattered into the long grass.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 6}, {"Plot Function": "Shows Karl's immediate physical reaction to the incident, indicating his rising anger before he verbalizes it.", "Grimm Style": "'Turned beet-red' is a common idiom, perhaps more colloquial than archaic Grimm, but effectively conveys intense anger with simple imagery. Grimm tales do use simple color imagery (e.g., Snow White 'red as blood'). Sentence structure is simple.", "Moral Implication": "Visually demonstrates the lack of control Karl has over his physiological response to anger, an outward sign of the inner turmoil.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "'Beet-red' is a somatic manifestation of rage, the body physically reacting to the emotional surge. It\u2019s a primal, visible signal of losing control.", "Sentence": "Karl turned beet-red.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 7}, {"Plot Function": "Karl verbalizes his anger and shows intent to act on it violently, marking the peak of his temper before the magical intervention.", "Grimm Style": "Dialogue is direct and expresses clear emotion ('You wretched beast!'). 'Roared' is a strong verb, fitting for extreme anger. 'Raising his fist' is a clear, simple action. This is typical of Grimm characters expressing anger.", "Moral Implication": "Shows Karl about to commit an act of violence out of anger towards an innocent animal, highlighting the moral failing of his temper and setting the stage for a just, magical consequence.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The roar and raised fist are primitive, aggressive responses. The 'wretched beast' label projects his inner ugliness onto the pig. This is the moment the uncontrolled Id is about to physically manifest its destructive impulse.", "Sentence": "\"You wretched beast!\" he roared, raising his fist.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 8}, {"Plot Function": "Marks the turning point \u2013 the magical intervention begins, preventing Karl's violent act and initiating his transformation. This is the inciting magical event.", "Grimm Style": "'But before he could...' is a common way to introduce an interruption. 'Strange tingling' is a simple sensory detail to herald magic. The sentence structure (compound) builds slight suspense before revealing the nature of the tingling. Use of 'strange' aligns with magical occurrences.", "Moral Implication": "The intervention can be seen as a direct consequence of his intended violent outburst, a magical justice that prevents a worse act by transforming the aggressor.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'strange tingling' is the intrusion of the magical or the unconscious, reacting to the peak of his negative emotional state. It\u2019s a physical manifestation of a profound internal shift about to occur, a point of no return forced upon him.", "Sentence": "But before he could strike the pig, a strange tingling ran through him.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 9}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the initial sensations and process of Karl's magical transformation.", "Grimm Style": "The verbs 'shrinking, hardening, changing' are simple, concrete, and describe a physical process. The repetition creates a rhythmic, incantatory feel, which can be found in Grimm descriptions of magic. Active voice ('He felt').", "Moral Implication": "The physical transformation reflects an internal one: his humanity is being stripped away due to his inhuman behavior (uncontrolled rage).", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "'Shrinking' could symbolize diminishing humanity or status. 'Hardening' suggests becoming unfeeling, rigid, or object-like. 'Changing' signifies a loss of his known self, a descent into an alien state of being.", "Sentence": "He felt himself shrinking, hardening, changing.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 10}, {"Plot Function": "Details the specific physical changes Karl undergoes, transforming him into a wheelbarrow. This is the core of the magical event.", "Grimm Style": "The description is very direct and physical, detailing parts of his body becoming parts of an object. 'Sturdy wooden handles,' 'deep wooden basin,' 'single wheel' are concrete and functional. The transformation is matter-of-factly stated, typical of Grimm magic. Sentence structure is compound, listing the changes.", "Moral Implication": "The transformation into an inanimate, utilitarian object is a fitting punishment for his dehumanizing anger. He becomes a tool, reflecting how his anger perhaps made him less than human, a mere force.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Becoming a wheelbarrow symbolizes objectification, loss of agency, and being reduced to a purely functional, unfeeling state. His limbs becoming handles and his torso a basin represents a profound loss of human form and autonomy, becoming a vessel to be used by others.", "Sentence": "His legs became sturdy wooden handles, his arms vanished, his torso broadened into a deep wooden basin, and a single wheel sprouted beneath him.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 11}, {"Plot Function": "Concludes the transformation, emphasizing its speed and finality. Karl the human is replaced by Karl the object.", "Grimm Style": "'In the space of a breath' is a classic fairy tale expression for swiftness. The contrast 'Karl the farmer was gone, and in his place stood a stout wooden wheelbarrow' is stark and direct, typical of Grimm's unadorned narration of magical events. 'Stout wooden wheelbarrow' is simple description.", "Moral Implication": "The swiftness of the change emphasizes the immediate and total consequence of his peak anger. His identity as a farmer is erased, replaced by that of an object, a direct result of his flaw.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The transformation is a metaphorical death of his current self and a rebirth into a state of helplessness and objectification. It\u2019s a radical stripping away of ego and identity, forced by the magical consequence of his rage.", "Sentence": "In the space of a breath, Karl the farmer was gone, and in his place stood a stout wooden wheelbarrow.", "Chapter Number": 2, "Sentence Number": 12}, {"Plot Function": "Marta's appearance creates dramatic irony, as she is unaware of Karl's transformation. Her call for supper highlights his new, helpless state.", "Grimm Style": "Marta's dialogue is simple and domestic ('Karl? Supper is ready!'). Calling a name and stating a fact is direct. Sentence structure is simple. The scene is typical of a household routine interrupted by magic.", "Moral Implication": "Reinforces the isolation Karl now experiences; normal life continues around him, but he cannot participate. His wife's innocent call is a poignant reminder of what he has lost through his anger.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Marta represents the normalcy and human connection Karl has just forfeited. 'Supper is ready' symbolizes nourishment and domestic comfort, now inaccessible to him in his transformed state. The irony underscores his alienation.", "Sentence": "Marta came out, calling, \"Karl? Supper is ready!\"", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 13}, {"Plot Function": "Describes Marta's observation of the scene, noting the pig and the newly appeared wheelbarrow, beginning her slight puzzlement.", "Grimm Style": "Simple observation. 'Snuffling happily' gives the pig a simple, unconcerned characteristic. 'Standing oddly' is a subtle hint that something is amiss. Sentence structure is straightforward. Uses simple conjunction 'and'.", "Moral Implication": "The pig's happiness contrasts with Karl's presumed horror, emphasizing that his anger was unjustified and the world moves on without his drama. The 'oddly' placed wheelbarrow is the first hint of the unnatural.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The pig's contentment highlights the natural order, undisturbed by Karl's rage now that he's neutralized. The wheelbarrow's 'odd' placement is a subtle sign of the magical disruption, not yet understood by Marta.", "Sentence": "She saw the pig snuffling happily and the wheelbarrow standing oddly near the fence.", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 14}, {"Plot Function": "Marta repeats her call, her puzzlement growing slightly, but she doesn't yet suspect the truth.", "Grimm Style": "Repetition of the call 'Karl?' emphasizes her searching and slight confusion. 'Puzzled' is a direct statement of her emotion. Simple sentence structure.", "Moral Implication": "The lack of response deepens the sense of Karl's isolation and the completeness of his transformation.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Her repeated, unanswered call underscores Karl's loss of voice and presence. She is searching for the human, unaware he is present in an inhuman form.", "Sentence": "\"Karl?\" she called again, puzzled.", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 15}, {"Plot Function": "Marta notices subtle, strange details about the wheelbarrow that almost lead her to a realization, creating suspense, but she dismisses them. This is a near-discovery.", "Grimm Style": "The observation of 'wood seemed warm' and handles looking 'strangely like...' adds a touch of eerie magic. Her internal thought 'No, it couldn't be' is a simple way to show dismissal of an unsettling idea. This near-realization and dismissal is a common trope. Sentence structure is compound, linking observation and dismissal.", "Moral Implication": "Shows how reality can be stranger than imagined. Marta's dismissal highlights how people rationalize the uncanny. Karl remains trapped, his true state unrecognized despite the clues.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'warm wood' and familiar-looking handles are remnants of Karl's humanity, almost perceptible. Marta's rational mind dismisses the impossible, representing the conscious mind's resistance to believe in profound, magical transformations or the unbelievable truth, even when clues are present.", "Sentence": "The wheelbarrow remained silent, but she noticed the wood seemed warm, and the handles looked strangely like... No, it couldn't be.", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 16}, {"Plot Function": "Marta gives up her search and returns inside, leaving Karl to his fate for the night. This ends the immediate scene of discovery.", "Grimm Style": "'Shaking her head' is a simple, common gesture of dismissal or confusion. 'Went back inside' is a straightforward action. Simple sentence structure. Adheres to the matter-of-fact tone.", "Moral Implication": "Karl is left alone in his transformed state, unrecognized and helpless. The ordinary world continues, emphasizing his isolation due to his flaw.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Marta's return inside signifies the closing off of immediate help or recognition. Karl is left to confront his new reality alone, a common stage in transformative journeys where the protagonist must face their changed state in isolation.", "Sentence": "Shaking her head, she went back inside.", "Chapter Number": 3, "Sentence Number": 17}, {"Plot Function": "Reveals Karl's internal state in his transformed form \u2013 horror and helplessness. This is the first direct insight into his experience as a wheelbarrow.", "Grimm Style": "'Horrified' is a direct emotional descriptor. The description of being 'trapped' is simple. While Grimm tales don't usually delve deep into psychology, a simple statement of horror at such a transformation fits. The language is clear.", "Moral Implication": "The horror is a direct consequence of his anger. His previous power (to roar, to break) is contrasted with his current utter helplessness, a harsh lesson.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Being 'trapped in wheelbarrow form' is a powerful metaphor for being imprisoned by the consequences of one's actions or character flaws. Horror signifies the Ego's reaction to a complete loss of control and identity.", "Sentence": "Karl, trapped in wheelbarrow form, was horrified.", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 18}, {"Plot Function": "Emphasizes Karl's loss of agency \u2013 he is now dependent on others for movement.", "Grimm Style": "Simple, declarative sentence stating a clear limitation. 'Couldn't move unless pushed' is direct and impactful. Active voice (implied 'He could not move').", "Moral Implication": "His physical immobility is a punishment for his previously uncontrolled, destructive movements and actions fueled by anger.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Loss of self-locomotion symbolizes a complete loss of autonomy and free will. He has become a passive object, subject to the will of others, a stark contrast to his previous aggressive agency.", "Sentence": "He couldn't move unless pushed.", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 19}, {"Plot Function": "Highlights another critical loss \u2013 his ability to communicate.", "Grimm Style": "Another short, declarative sentence emphasizing his limitations. 'Couldn't speak' is blunt and clear.", "Moral Implication": "His inability to speak is a punishment for his previous angry roars and verbal abuse. He is now silenced.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Loss of speech signifies inability to express himself, ask for help, or assert his identity. It's a profound form of isolation and powerlessness, a common fear.", "Sentence": "He couldn't speak.", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 20}, {"Plot Function": "Describes his passive existence and sensory experience as a wheelbarrow, emphasizing his helplessness and exposure.", "Grimm Style": "Simple sensory detail ('evening dew settle on his wooden basin'). 'Could only sit there' emphasizes passivity. The language is concrete. Sentence structure is straightforward.", "Moral Implication": "He is now subject to the elements and the passage of time in a way he wasn't before, a humbling experience. His previous active rage is replaced by passive endurance.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'evening dew' settling on him symbolizes the cold reality of his situation and the passage of time in this helpless state. His 'wooden basin' is now what experiences the world for him, a hard, unfeeling surface compared to human skin.", "Sentence": "He could only sit there, feeling the evening dew settle on his wooden basin.", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 21}, {"Plot Function": "Shows a shift in Karl's emotional state from his characteristic anger to terror, indicating the beginning of his internal change.", "Grimm Style": "Direct statement of emotional change. 'Anger had cooled into sheer terror' is a more psychologically nuanced phrase than typical Grimm, which might simply state 'he was afraid'. However, 'cooled' is a simple verb. 'Sheer terror' is a strong but direct emotional descriptor.", "Moral Implication": "The terror is a direct result of understanding the severity of his punishment. This fear is the first step towards remorse and change, as his dominant emotion (anger) is replaced.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Anger, a 'hot' emotion, 'cooling' into 'sheer terror,' a 'cold' one, signifies a psychological shift from outward aggression to inward fear and vulnerability. Terror can be a catalyst for profound change when one confronts the dire consequences of their behavior.", "Sentence": "His anger had cooled into sheer terror.", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 22}, {"Plot Function": "Karl recalls Marta's prophecy, connecting his current predicament directly to her earlier warning and his own actions. This is a moment of realization.", "Grimm Style": "Recalling a previous statement is a common narrative device. Marta's words are repeated, reinforcing their importance. Sentence structure is simple. This direct linking of prophecy to fulfillment is very Grimm-like.", "Moral Implication": "He acknowledges the truth of the warning, understanding that his fate is a direct result of his uncontrolled anger. This is crucial for his eventual redemption; he recognizes his fault.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Remembering Marta's words signifies the return of wisdom or conscience. The prophecy fulfilled implies an inescapable karmic justice or the inevitable outcome of unchecked negative traits.", "Sentence": "He remembered Marta's words, \"Your anger will carry you off one day!\"", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 23}, {"Plot Function": "Karl explicitly understands the nature of his transformation \u2013 his anger has turned him into a mundane object. This solidifies his realization.", "Grimm Style": "Simple, direct statement of his understanding. 'Carried him into being a garden tool' is a plain, almost bleakly humorous summary of his fate. The language is unadorned. Fits the matter-of-fact tone for concluding a realization.", "Moral Implication": "The transformation into a 'garden tool' is a humbling reduction from a farmer, a man, to a mere implement. It underscores the debasing effect of his anger.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Being a 'garden tool' symbolizes a fall from human status to that of a mere object, subject to the will of others and the forces of nature. It\u2019s a metaphor for total loss of self-determination due to a character flaw taking over.", "Sentence": "It seemed it had carried him into being a garden tool.", "Chapter Number": 4, "Sentence Number": 24}, {"Plot Function": "Shows Marta interacting with the transformed Karl, unknowingly using him as a tool. This begins the phase of his punishment where he experiences life as an object.", "Grimm Style": "'The next morning' is a typical temporal transition. Marta's action is practical and simple. 'Decided it was sturdy enough to use' is a plain assessment. Sentence structure is compound. Adheres to Grimm simplicity.", "Moral Implication": "The irony of being used by his own wife, who is unaware of his identity, is a poignant part of his punishment. He is valued only for his utility as an object.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Marta's utilitarian use of Karl signifies his complete objectification. His 'sturdiness' (a result of his 'hardened' transformation) is now his only perceived value. This is a state of extreme Ego deflation.", "Sentence": "The next morning, Marta came out and, seeing the wheelbarrow, decided it was sturdy enough to use.", "Chapter Number": 5, "Sentence Number": 25}, {"Plot Function": "Describes the first instance of Karl being used as a wheelbarrow by Marta, highlighting the indignity of his situation.", "Grimm Style": "Action is described simply ('loaded Karl with weeds and pushed him'). 'Compost heap' is a mundane, earthy detail. The sentence structure is straightforward. Using 'Karl' instead of 'the wheelbarrow' maintains the reader's awareness of his true identity.", "Moral Implication": "Being filled with 'weeds' (unwanted things) and taken to a 'compost heap' (place of decay and transformation for waste) is a humbling and degrading experience, a direct consequence of his 'trashy' behavior when angry.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Weeds symbolize negative or unwanted aspects. Being pushed to the compost heap signifies being treated as refuse or base matter, undergoing a process of decomposition of his old self. It is a state of utter humiliation for his ego.", "Sentence": "She loaded Karl with weeds and pushed him to the compost heap.", "Chapter Number": 5, "Sentence Number": 26}, {"Plot Function": "Reveals Karl's internal reaction to this treatment \u2013 silent endurance. This shows a change from his previous roaring anger to passive suffering.", "Grimm Style": "'Silently endured the indignity' is a direct statement of his internal experience and action. 'Indignity' is a slightly more sophisticated word, but the concept is clear. Simple sentence.", "Moral Implication": "His silent endurance is part of his penance. He is forced to experience helplessness and humility, emotions opposite to his previous arrogance and rage.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "Silent endurance signifies a stage of forced introspection and acceptance of his current state.

It highlights the isolation of his experience; his pain is invisible to the world.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'rough ground' symbolizes the harshness of his experience.

'Slight easing, a loosening of his wooden form' describes the magical effect simply. The phrasing 'cursed mightily' is somewhat archaic and fitting. The sentence is complex but clearly describes the conditional magic.", "Moral Implication": "This detail suggests that anger itself is the key, but the source matters. It hints that merely witnessing anger isn't sufficient; a personal, powerful emotional experience is needed. It also shows that other people's uncontrolled anger is also a negative force.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The 'loosening' suggests that the grip of his transformed state can be affected by strong emotional energies.

The relief is not just about being human again, but also about being free from the tyranny of his own temper.", "Metaphorical/Psychological Meaning": "The absence of anger signifies a profound psychological healing or rebalancing.
