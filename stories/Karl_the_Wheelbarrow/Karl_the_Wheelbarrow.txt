Karl the Wheelbarrow
There once lived a farmer named Karl who had a terrible temper. When things went wrong, which they often did on his stony farm, he would bellow and roar, kick stones, and sometimes even break his own tools in fury. His wife, Marta, was a patient soul, but she often sighed, "Oh, Karl, your anger will carry you off one day!"
One afternoon, Karl was trying to fix a broken fence post while his prize pig rooted nearby. The pig, paying no heed, knocked over Karl’s pot of nails. They scattered into the long grass. Karl turned beet-red. "You wretched beast!" he roared, raising his fist. But before he could strike the pig, a strange tingling ran through him. He felt himself shrinking, hardening, changing. His legs became sturdy wooden handles, his arms vanished, his torso broadened into a deep wooden basin, and a single wheel sprouted beneath him. In the space of a breath, Karl the farmer was gone, and in his place stood a stout wooden wheelbarrow.
Marta came out, calling, "Karl? Supper is ready!" She saw the pig snuffling happily and the wheelbarrow standing oddly near the fence. "Karl?" she called again, puzzled. The wheelbarrow remained silent, but she noticed the wood seemed warm, and the handles looked strangely like... No, it couldn't be. Shaking her head, she went back inside.
Karl, trapped in wheelbarrow form, was horrified. He couldn't move unless pushed. He couldn't speak. He could only sit there, feeling the evening dew settle on his wooden basin. His anger had cooled into sheer terror. He remembered Marta's words, "Your anger will carry you off one day!" It seemed it had carried him into being a garden tool.
The next morning, Marta came out and, seeing the wheelbarrow, decided it was sturdy enough to use. She loaded Karl with weeds and pushed him to the compost heap. Karl silently endured the indignity. Later, young Fritz from the neighbouring farm borrowed him to carry stones. Fritz whistled cheerfully as he bumped Karl over the rough ground, unaware that the wheelbarrow was silently groaning.
Days turned into weeks. Karl remained a wheelbarrow. He learned that his transformation was tied to his temper. If someone nearby expressed great anger – like when the neighbour’s bull broke loose and the neighbour cursed mightily – Karl felt a slight easing, a loosening of his wooden form, but it wasn't enough. He needed his *own* anger to trigger the change back, but how could a wheelbarrow feel anger? He felt only misery and regret.
One market day, Marta decided to take some vegetables to town. She loaded them into Karl. As she pushed him along the road, they passed the village smithy. The blacksmith, a large man named Otto, was arguing furiously with a customer who refused to pay. Otto roared, swung his hammer, and brought it down mightily upon his anvil, missing it slightly and striking his own thumb. His bellow of rage and pain echoed through the village.
A powerful surge went through Karl. The blacksmith's overwhelming fury resonated with his own suppressed temper. He felt the wood soften, stretch. The wheel retracted, legs sprouted, arms reappeared. With a loud crack, the wheelbarrow vanished, and Karl stood there, dazed and dusty, amidst a pile of scattered turnips and carrots.
Marta shrieked in surprise. The blacksmith and customer stopped arguing, mouths agape. Karl looked down at his hands, felt his face. He was himself again! He felt no anger, only immense relief.
"Marta!" he cried, rushing to her. "It was me! Your anger carried me off, just as you said! But Otto's anger brought me back!"
From that day on, Karl was a changed man. Whenever he felt his temper rising, he remembered the feeling of being cold, hard wood, bumped over stones and filled with weeds. He learned to take deep breaths, to walk away, even to laugh when the pig knocked over his nails. He was still a farmer on a stony patch of land, but he was no longer Karl the Wheelbarrow, and for that, he was eternally grateful. And sometimes, when Otto the blacksmith was having a particularly frustrating day, Karl would send Marta over with a calming cup of herbal tea.
