Location: Castle Attics

Location: Secluded Tower (Anna's final confinement)
Detailed Description: A solitary, circular stone tower, approximately 15 feet in internal diameter and 50 feet tall, constructed of rough, dark grey stones. It stands at the furthest western edge of the palace grounds, with its few windows directly overlooking the encroaching Dark Forest of Thorns.

A single heavy, planked wooden door, reinforced with iron bands and a large iron ring handle, is the only entrance. The interior is one stark, circular room with a cold, uneven flagstone floor and bare stone walls.
Props: A narrow straw-filled pallet on the stone floor for a bed, covered with a single, thin grey blanket; a small, rough-hewn three-legged wooden stool; a chipped, unglazed clay pitcher containing murky water, resting on the floor; later, a single black thorn, three inches long, sharply pointed and slightly glistening, lying directly on the stone floor between the door and the pallet; the water in the pitcher becomes cloudy and brackish.

A large, flat-topped granite boulder, about 4 feet high and 6 feet across, its surface almost entirely covered in dark green moss, sits near the center of the glade.

Props: Ancient gnarled oak trees with wide trunks and hollows at their bases; large, moss-covered granite boulders scattered throughout; streams with clear water running over pebbly beds, or in one case, an illusionary uphill flow created by cunningly shaped rocks and channels; a patch of cracked, dry, barren earth near the Dark Forest's edge, about 20 feet square.
Architectural Style: None, an ancient, wild, and minimally disturbed natural temperate forest.

Overall Artstyle:
detailed colorful early 20th century illustration style, reminiscent of Arthur Rackham or Edmund Dulac, with rich textures, soft lighting, and a fantastical yet grounded feel.

Location: Royal Preserve (Sacred Grove)
Detailed Description: A perfectly circular grove, perhaps 100 yards in diameter, located in the deepest, most hidden part of the Royal Preserve. It is filled with a soft, warm, golden light that seems to emanate from the air itself or from the flora within. The air is unusually warm and sweet with the scent of unknown, faintly luminescent white and pale blue flowers that grow in clusters on the forest floor. The central feature is a colossal, ancient tree, far larger than any other in the Preserve, with smooth, shimmering silver bark and leaves that constantly shift through all the colors of the rainbow. The ground is covered in soft, vibrant green moss.
Props: The great silver-barked tree with iridescent, rainbow-hued leaves; clusters of unknown, luminescent white and pale blue flowers; an ancient flat stone tablet (3 feet long by 2 feet wide) of dark grey stone, carved with intricate, swirling, unknown symbols, lying half in shadow, partially covered by a thick, clinging, shadowy vine with dark green, heart-shaped leaves and small, black berries; a dry streambed, about 3 feet wide, and a blockage formed by a massive, moss-covered fallen log (at least 4 feet in diameter) and a jumble of smaller, lichen-covered rocks; a flowering bush with delicate, bell-shaped white flowers and a small, vividly blue-and-gold songbird with dull, listless feathers, perched silently within it.
Architectural Style: None, a magically enhanced, pristine natural sanctuary.

Characters Present:
  Elder Prince (young man):
    Age: Around ten years old at start, grows into a young man of early twenties.
    Build: Average height as a child, grows to 5 feet 11 inches, with a lean and athletic physique.
    Facial features: A high forehead suggesting thoughtfulness, keen, intelligent brown eyes, a defined jawline. Develops a quiet strength and resolute expression as he matures.
    Hairstyle: Dark brown, wavy hair, kept neatly trimmed as a child, slightly longer and often tucked behind his ears as a young man.
    Outfit: Mature Princely Attire: A tailored doublet of deep crimson brocade patterned with small, repeating silver falcons, fastened with five silver clasps, over a fine white linen shirt with ruffled cuffs, dark grey fitted trousers, and polished black riding boots.

    Facial features: An oval face of ethereal quality, with large eyes the precise color of clear spring water just after a rain, fringed with long, dark lashes. Her skin seems to possess a faint inner luminosity, like alabaster lit from within. Her lips are naturally rose-tinted, and her expression is one of gentle wisdom and fearless compassion.
    Hairstyle: Very long, dark brown hair, like polished walnut wood, that falls in soft, natural waves almost to her knees. It is unbound and unadorned, save for perhaps a few tiny, star-like wildflowers unknowingly caught in its lengths.
    Outfit: A simple, flowing gown made of a fabric that resembles fresh, young leaves, in varying shades of spring green from pale lime to deep emerald. The gown seems to have no visible seams, as if it were grown rather than sewn, and it drapes around her in soft folds, ending at her bare feet.

Location: The Kingdom / Royal Preserve
Detailed Description: A realm characterized by rolling green hills, interspersed with small farming villages consisting of timber-framed cottages with steeply pitched, dark brown thatched roofs. Winding dirt roads, often muddy, connect these settlements. Initially, the fields surrounding the villages are golden with ripe wheat or green with young crops; later, these colors become muted, fields appear poorly tended, and a general air of neglect and dimness pervades the landscape.
Props: Distant views of small villages with thin plumes of grey smoke rising from stone chimneys; fields of wheat (initially golden, later dull brown or greyish) or fallow ground with sparse, weedy growth; a winding dirt road with deep ruts.
Architectural Style: Rural medieval European vernacular architecture for villages.
