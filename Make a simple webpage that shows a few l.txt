Introduction.
Make a simple webpage that shows a few lists. One is a list of structured output (json files contained int the formats directory), a list of seeds (contained in the seeds directory) with dynamic preview of the selected file. There should also be a picker for number of chapters and numbber of sentences per chapter. The webpage should be launced from another webpage (which I already have built) and a prompt text object is sent with it. Your webpage is going to combine there things into a combined string that will be used as a combined prompt for AI. The resulting combined prompt should look something like this:  


"""Read this authors guide:
BEGIN AUTHORS GUIDE
´´´
{{ authors_guide_data }}
´´´
END AUTHORS GUIDE

The following story will be analyzed according to the authors guide:
BEGIN STORY
´´´
{{ seed_data['The Complete Story'].Title }}
{{ seed_data['The Complete Story'].Chapters }}
´´´
END STORY


Here is the analysis of each sentence of the story one by one structured in chapters where there is a chapter for each sentence in order. Each sentence is regarded in relation to the whole story, morals, and metaphorical or psychological meanings (if there are any).
BEGIN ANALYSIS
´´´
{{ seed_data.Analysis.toJsonString() }}
´´´
END ANALYSIS
Now for your task:
BEGIN PROMPT
Write a new essay and as you go along you need to come up with a new original story. Let each chapter consist of {{ sentences_per_chapter }} sentences.  Write {{ chapters_count }} chapters, so there will be {{ sentences_per_chapter *chapters_count}} sentence sections in total.  DO NOT COME UP WITH THE PLOT OR TITLE OR SETTING OR ANYTHING AT ALL BEFORE STARTING WRITING.  You as the author need to come up with the plot "as you go" writing this. For each section (sentence) start by writing the analysis/explanation/commenatary of the sentence and then write the sentence last after these, (plot function, grimm style, moral implication, metaphorical/psychological meaning, sentence). This way you will "plan out" the sentence before writing it.   

You must also adhere to the following guidelines:  
- Do not come up with names for characters, just call them "the king's son" or "The miller". 
- Do not come up with names for places (like Whispering Woods or anything like that). Just say "A dark forest". 
- Do not describe the inner state of characters (example to avoid: "her heart full of both fear and a strange resolve. ").  

I also have some requirements for elements to be present in this particular story: 
{{ prompt_text_object }}

Make sure that you cover different details when analyzing each sentence. So if "plot function" touches on the next step of the story, leave that unsaid in the rest of the sections you write for that sentence.  Do not write an intruduction. Finally, write out the whole story exactly as stated all the way until sentence {{ sentences_per_chapter * chapters_count}}.
END PROMPT
{{ format_data.toJsonString() }}"""

Additional information:
format_data: the json read from the selected file in the formats folder.
autors_guid_data: the text read from prompt\Authors guide short.txt
seed_data: The json read from the selected file in the seeds folder (these files end in .txt)
sentences_per_chapter: entered by the user (default 10)
chapters_count: Entered by the user (default 7)
prompt_text_object: comes when opening the page

Additional requests: 
- Please explain to me how I can send my prompt_text_object to this page from my other page using a link.
