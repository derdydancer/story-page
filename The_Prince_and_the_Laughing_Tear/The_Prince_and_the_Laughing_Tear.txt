The Prince and the Laughing Tear
There was a king whose palace garden withered, though his gardeners worked hard. His queen spent her days arranging the palace curtains and polishing the silver. The king's son, who it was said was clever, was returning from a long journey. Now, a clattering pot on the highest tower kept all in the palace awake night after night. The king shot arrows at the pot, but they always missed. The queen ordered soft cushions placed on all the beds, but the clatter came through. The prince arrived home, heard the clatter, saw the arrows stuck in the tower wall, and felt the useless cushions. He said to the king, "Give me only some butter, a ladder, and a long pole." The prince climbed the ladder, reached out with the pole, and smeared butter all around the pot's bottom. That night, the pot did not clatter, and the palace slept in silence.
Now, the king had a great cheese, round as the moon. He declared it was the only thing that brought him joy. Each morning he rolled it out onto the palace lawn, and each evening he rolled it back inside. One morning, a stray goat came by and ate a piece from the edge. When the king saw the missing piece, he wept for a day. The queen covered the spot with a silken cloth. The prince saw the bite mark beneath the cloth. He said, "We should find the goat and make it pay for the cheese." So servants searched the nearby town and found the goat. The prince took a pot of blue paint and painted the goat bright blue.
After that, everyone knew the king's blue goat, and people laughed when it passed. But the king soon forgot the cheese, for now he missed one of his woolen socks. He declared no work would be done until the sock was found, and offered half the kingdom for its return. So everyone in the kingdom stopped working and looked for the missing sock. The queen knitted a new sock, exactly like the old one. But the king knew at once it was not his sock, for it did not smell of his feet. The prince looked high and low, under beds and behind curtains. At last he found the blue goat behind the water barrel, chewing on the missing sock. The prince tickled the goat's nose until it sneezed the sock out. The king rejoiced to have his smelly sock again, and the kingdom went back to work.
Some time after, a great sickness fell upon the land. People grew weary, and it was said they forgot how to laugh or weep. The king sat still in his chair and stared at the wall. The queen read many old books, seeking a cure. At last she found a passage that spoke of a cure: the tear of the laughing tortoise. No one believed there could be such a thing. But the prince said he would go forth and seek it. He took only bread and a skin of water, and walked towards the mountains. He travelled for many days over rough paths. At last he came to a high meadow where an old turtle sat basking on a stone.
The turtle's shell was wrinkled like an old map, and moss grew upon its back. "Good father turtle," said the prince, "I seek the tear of the laughing tortoise." The turtle slowly drew its head into its shell, then slowly poked it back out. "Laughter and tears are neighbours," said the turtle. "Sit here until you understand why." So the prince sat down on the grass beside the stone. He sat for three days and three nights. The sun warmed him by day, the stars shone on him by night, and the turtle sat still. On the third morning, the prince thought of the blue goat and the king's sock, and he laughed aloud. Then he thought of the sickness in his land, and how no one laughed or wept, and he wept. As his tear fell upon the stone, the old turtle caught it on a dry leaf.
"This tear holds both laughter and weeping," said the turtle. "Take it now, and put it in the palace well." The prince carefully wrapped the leaf and started back the way he came. He reached the palace, where all were still weary and grey. He went to the palace well and dropped the leaf with the tear into the water. Soon, those who drank the water began to smile, and then they began to weep. Laughter and tears returned together to the land. Even the king stood up from his chair and said he felt better. The queen opened all the curtains to let in the sun. The prince was praised throughout the kingdom. And the blue goat lived in the royal stable and was given warm milk each day.
Years passed, and the king thought himself quite well again. He decided it was time for the prince to marry. The queen consulted her old books again to find the perfect bride. She read that the prince must marry a princess who did not know her own name. Messengers were sent far and wide searching for such a princess. The prince grew tired of waiting, disguised himself as a poor scholar, and went searching himself. He found, in a remote castle, a simple maiden who knew only the names of flowers. The prince taught her a false name and brought her back to the palace. The king and queen rejoiced, and there was a great wedding feast. But as they feasted, the old turtle arrived slowly at the palace gate.
 The guards opened the gate, and the turtle entered slowly into the feast hall." All the guests fell silent and stared at the strange, old creature." The turtle walked straight past the king and queen to where the prince sat with his bride." It looked at the bride and asked in a quiet, creaking voice, "Who are you, maiden?"" The bride smiled and recited the false name the prince had taught her." "That is not your name," said the turtle. "You know the names of flowers, but not your own."" The prince stood up quickly and said, "Good turtle, you are weary from your journey. It is late."" "Truth does not sleep," replied the turtle. "I have come to speak the truth of this maiden."" The king, seeing this, bade the turtle speak." "This maiden," said the turtle, "is the lost daughter of the mountain king, and her true name is Meadowsweet."" Hearing this, the bride's eyes grew wide." The queen gasped and dropped her silver goblet." "The books foretold this!" she cried. "If he married the one who knew her name, the kingdom will fall!"" The king grew pale and drew his sword halfway from its sheath." But the prince stepped quickly before his bride." "I gave her the false name, father," he said. "But she is the reason our land was healed. How can she bring ruin?"" "Books hold ink, not breath," said the turtle. "Judge the tree by its fruit, not by the shadow it casts on a page."" Meadowsweet, whose true name now felt like warmth inside her, gently touched the king's sword hand." The king looked at her clear eyes, then slowly slid the sword back into its sheath." And the feast went on, though quieter than before." When the feast ended, the turtle turned and left as slowly as it came.
